# A Day in the Life of Aisha: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Aisha, a 40-year-old Somali American woman who owns a small Somali restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Working mother character relatable to many families
- Restaurant/cooking vocabulary (stove, pot, knife, spice, rice, meat, apron)
- Somali American cultural context (hijab, prayer, halal food, Somali tea)
- Minneapolis winter setting (snow, cold, warm indoor spaces)
- Family of five with children at different ages plus a pet cat
- Islamic practices shown respectfully and naturally
- Objects shown in real-world settings
- Cultural context embedded naturally

### Scene 001: Pre-Dawn Alarm
**Time:** 5:30 AM -- dark, no natural light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, view of nightstand and bed
**Description:** The digital alarm clock on the wooden nightstand glows 5:30 in green numbers in the dark bedroom. Aisha's hand reaches from under the burgundy comforter to press the alarm button. The room is dark except for the faint glow of the clock. The orange tabby cat Basra is curled at the foot of the queen bed, one ear twitching at the sound. A bedside lamp with a cream shade sits next to the clock. Reading glasses rest beside a small book on the nightstand. The prayer rug is folded neatly on the floor beside the bed.

### Scene 002: Sitting Up in Darkness
**Time:** 5:31 AM -- dark, alarm clock glow
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha sits up in bed, the burgundy comforter falling to her waist. She wears a long white cotton nightgown. Her dark hair is in a loose bun, slightly messy from sleep. She rubs her eyes with one hand. Her face shows the quiet determination of someone used to waking before dawn. The orange cat Basra lifts his head, blinks slowly at her, then settles back down. The window shows complete darkness outside -- a Minneapolis winter morning, no sunrise yet. Decorative pillows are piled on the other side of the bed.

### Scene 003: Turning On the Lamp
**Time:** 5:32 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, nightstand close-up
**Description:** Aisha reaches over and clicks on the bedside lamp. Warm golden light spills across the nightstand, illuminating the digital alarm clock, her reading glasses, a small copy of the Quran with a green leather cover, and a glass of water. Her brown hand with neat short nails rests on the lamp base. The burgundy comforter is rumpled. On the dresser across the room, the shapes of neatly folded hijabs are just visible in the lamplight -- stacks of teal, purple, cream, and burgundy fabric.

### Scene 004: Feet on the Floor
**Time:** 5:33 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, low angle at bedside
**Description:** Aisha swings her legs over the side of the bed, her bare feet touching the carpet. She wears the long white cotton nightgown that reaches her ankles. The prayer rug -- a rectangular rug with a deep green and gold geometric pattern -- lies folded on the floor beside the bed. Her slippers, simple brown house slippers, sit neatly on the carpet. The orange cat Basra has shifted to the warm spot she just left in the bed, stretching out lazily. The bedside lamp casts a warm circle of light.

### Scene 005: Walking to the Bathroom
**Time:** 5:34 AM -- dim hallway light
**Setting:** Townhouse hallway outside bedroom, heading to bathroom
**Description:** Aisha walks down the short hallway toward the master bathroom, her brown house slippers padding softly on the carpet. She wears the white nightgown, dark hair in a messy bun. The hallway is dim, lit only by a small nightlight plugged into the wall near the floor. Family photos hang on the beige walls -- a wedding photo, school portraits of three children at different ages, a family group photo. The children's bedroom doors are closed. The house is completely quiet.

### Scene 006: Bathroom Light On
**Time:** 5:35 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Master bathroom, wide view

A small bath rug sits on the white tile floor. On the counter beside the sink: a soap dispenser, a small cup for water, a comb, hair ties, and modest toiletries.

Her expression is serene and unhurried despite the early hour.

### Scene 012: Drying Off After Wudu
**Time:** 5:41 AM -- bright bathroom light

The bathroom is tidy -- soap dispenser back in place, cup emptied, faucet off. She slips her feet into the brown house slippers.

### Scene 013: Unfolding the Prayer Rug
**Time:** 5:43 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, floor beside bed

Her brown feet are bare on the green and gold prayer rug. The nightgown falls straight. Her face is turned downward in concentration. The lamp casts her shadow gently on the beige wall. The burgundy comforter on the bed is visible in the background. Complete silence.

### Scene 016: Prostration in Prayer -- Sujud
**Time:** 5:47 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at prayer rug

On the bed, the orange cat Basra has lifted his head to watch, one paw stretched forward.

### Scene 017: Sitting in Prayer -- Tashahhud
**Time:** 5:48 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at prayer rug
**Description:** Aisha sits on the prayer rug in the tashahhud position, sitting on her left foot with her right foot upright, right index finger raised and pointing forward. The white prayer garment rests on her shoulders. Her lips move silently in supplication. The green and gold rug supports her. The bedside lamp gives the scene a golden glow. The dresser with its stack of colorful hijabs is visible in the background. The Quran on the nightstand catches a glint of lamplight.

### Scene 018: Completing Prayer -- Turning Head
**Time:** 5:50 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at prayer rug
**Description:** Aisha turns her head to the right, saying the final salaam to complete the prayer. Her face is visible in gentle profile -- calm brown eyes, the trace of a peaceful smile on her round face. The white prayer garment frames her features. Then she turns her head to the left to repeat the salaam. The prayer rug's pointed arch is visible between her knees. The moment is quiet and complete. The lamp glows steadily. Basra the cat yawns on the bed.

### Scene 019: Folding the Prayer Rug
**Time:** 5:52 AM -- bedside lamp and growing gray light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, floor beside bed
**Description:** Aisha kneels on the carpet, carefully folding the green and gold prayer rug into a neat rectangle. She folds it in thirds lengthwise, then in half. The white prayer garment has been removed and draped over the bed post. Her dark hair is back in the loose bun. She places the folded rug in its spot beside the bed, patting it gently. The window shows the faintest hint of gray pre-dawn light. The alarm clock reads 5:52. Basra stretches on the bed, arching his orange back.

**Time:** 5:53 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, sitting on bed edge
**Description:** Aisha sits on the edge of the bed and picks up the small green leather-bound Quran from the nightstand. She opens it to a bookmarked page, the thin pages rustling softly. Her reading glasses are on her face now -- simple rectangular frames. Her brown eyes scan the Arabic text. One hand holds the book open, the other rests on the burgundy comforter. Basra the cat pads across the bed and settles beside her hip. The lamp lights the delicate pages.

### Scene 021: Reading Quran Quietly
**Time:** 5:55 AM -- bedside lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, on bed
**Description:** Aisha reads the Quran quietly, her lips moving with the words. The small green book rests in her lap. Her reading glasses sit on her nose. The orange cat Basra is curled against her side, purring -- one can imagine the gentle vibration. Her face is peaceful and absorbed. The nightgown is white and simple. Family photos on the dresser show her children at various ages. The window shows very faint gray light beginning to outline the frame. A bookmarker ribbon trails from the Quran's pages.

### Scene 022: Closing the Quran
**Time:** 5:58 AM -- bedside lamp and gray dawn light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, nightstand
**Description:** Aisha closes the Quran, sliding the ribbon bookmark into place. She removes her reading glasses and sets them beside the clock on the nightstand. She places the Quran carefully back in its spot, giving it a gentle, respectful touch. The clock reads 5:58.

### Scene 023: Making the Bed
**Time:** 6:00 AM -- gray dawn light and lamp
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha pulls up the burgundy comforter, smoothing it over the queen bed with both hands. She straightens the decorative pillows -- two cream pillows and one with a gold geometric pattern -- arranging them against the headboard. The cat Basra sits on the floor watching, having been gently displaced from the bed. The dresser with its hijab collection is visible. The window shows gray Minneapolis winter dawn -- bare tree branches against a pale sky. The prayer rug is folded in its place. The room is taking shape for the day.

### Scene 024: Choosing a Hijab
**Time:** 6:02 AM -- bedroom light on
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at dresser
**Description:** Aisha stands at the dresser, the overhead bedroom light now on. She surveys her hijab collection: neatly folded squares of fabric in purple, teal, burgundy, cream, and patterned prints stacked on the dresser top, with a few hanging from small hooks on the wall beside the dresser. She picks up a teal hijab, holds it against her nightgown, considers, then sets it aside for later -- she will put it on before leaving the house. Her dark hair is in the bun. Family photos in frames sit among the hijabs. Basra rubs against her ankles.

### Scene 025: Getting Dressed -- Home Clothes
**Time:** 6:05 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at closet
**Description:** Aisha pulls a long house dress from the closet -- a comfortable cotton dirac (Somali tunic) in a dark blue with small white floral print. It is long-sleeved and falls to her ankles. She lays it on the made bed beside a pair of black leggings. The closet door is open, showing organized hanging clothes -- tunics, long dresses, and pants in modest styles. A few pairs of comfortable shoes line the closet floor. The teal hijab she selected sits on the dresser, waiting. Basra has jumped back on the bed and is sitting on the leggings.

### Scene 026: Wearing the Dirac
**Time:** 6:07 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, standing
**Description:** Aisha is now dressed in the dark blue floral dirac over black leggings. The long tunic is comfortable and practical for morning kitchen work. Her dark hair remains in the bun -- she is at home with family, no hijab needed yet. She smoothes the fabric at her hips. Brown house slippers are on her feet. She looks at herself briefly in the small mirror on the back of the closet door. Her round face is alert now, ready for the morning. She gently moves Basra off the leggings that are now on her body.

### Scene 027: Walking Downstairs
**Time:** 6:08 AM -- hallway and stairway light
**Setting:** Townhouse stairway, heading down
**Description:** Aisha descends the townhouse stairway, one hand on the wooden banister. The stairs are carpeted in beige. Family photos line the stairway wall -- a timeline of the family growing up. At the top of the stairs, the closed doors of the children's bedrooms are visible. A small overhead light illuminates the stairway. Through a window on the landing, the Minneapolis winter sky is beginning to lighten from black to deep gray. Bare tree branches are silhouetted. The house is still quiet -- the children have not stirred yet.

### Scene 028: Entering the Kitchen
**Time:** 6:09 AM -- kitchen overhead light
**Setting:** Family kitchen in townhouse, wide view
**Description:** Aisha enters the family kitchen and switches on the overhead light. The kitchen has white cabinets, a gas stove, a refrigerator with children's drawings and school schedules held by magnets, a round kitchen table with four chairs and a high chair (no longer used but still present), a window over the sink showing the dark backyard. A fruit bowl with bananas and apples sits on the counter. The kitchen floor is linoleum. A cat food bowl and water dish sit on a small mat near the back door. Basra appears, trotting in behind her, heading straight for his bowl.

### Scene 029: Feeding the Cat
**Time:** 6:10 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, near back door
**Description:** Aisha bends down and scoops dry cat food from a bag under the counter into Basra's metal food bowl. The orange tabby cat stands eagerly beside the bowl, tail straight up, meowing. The small mat under the bowl is blue with paw prints on it. Basra's water dish sits next to the food bowl, half full. Aisha pours fresh water from a pitcher into the water dish. The cat immediately begins eating, crunching the kibble. Aisha straightens up, smiling down at the cat. The refrigerator hums in the background.

### Scene 030: Filling the Kettle
**Time:** 6:12 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Aisha fills a large stainless steel kettle at the kitchen sink, water streaming from the faucet into the kettle. Through the window above the sink, the backyard is dark -- a wooden fence, bare bushes, a thin layer of snow on the ground. She sets the heavy kettle on the gas stove burner and turns the knob. Blue flames lick up around the bottom of the kettle. The stove has four burners. A box of tea leaves -- Somali shaah (spiced tea) -- sits on the counter nearby, along with a container of cardamom pods and a small jar of sugar. Basra crunches kibble in the background.

### Scene 031: Making Canjeero Batter
**Time:** 6:14 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Aisha opens the refrigerator and takes out a bowl of canjeero batter (Somali flatbread batter) that she prepared the night before, covered with plastic wrap. The batter is a smooth, thin mixture. She sets it on the counter beside the stove and peels off the plastic wrap. A large flat non-stick pan is already on a burner. She stirs the batter with a wooden spoon, checking its consistency. On the counter: the fruit bowl with bananas and apples, a cutting board, and a bottle of cooking oil. The kitchen is warm and smells of the fermenting batter.

### Scene 032: Pouring Canjeero on the Pan
**Time:** 6:16 AM -- kitchen light, stove flame
**Description:** Aisha ladles canjeero batter onto the hot flat pan in a thin, circular motion, starting from the outside and spiraling inward. The batter sizzles as it hits the hot surface. She holds the ladle in her right hand, the bowl of batter in her left. The flatbread begins to cook, tiny bubbles forming on the surface. Steam rises from the pan. The blue gas flame is visible under the pan. The kitchen fills with the warm, slightly sour smell of cooking canjeero. The kettle on the next burner begins to steam.

### Scene 033: Flipping the Canjeero
**Time:** 6:18 AM -- kitchen light, stove flame
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove close-up
**Description:** Aisha uses a flat spatula to loosen the edges of the canjeero, then flips it with a quick motion. The underside is golden brown with a lacy pattern from the bubbles. The pan sizzles. She holds the spatula steady, watching the second side cook. A plate with two already-cooked canjeero sits beside the stove, covered with a clean cloth to keep warm. The kitchen is filling with warmth from the stove. Basra has finished eating and sits on the kitchen floor, washing his orange face with one paw.

### Scene 034: Brewing Somali Tea -- Shaah
**Time:** 6:20 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove
**Description:** The kettle whistles. Aisha lifts it off the burner and pours boiling water into a medium saucepan. She adds loose black tea leaves from a tin, crushed cardamom pods, a cinnamon stick, and a few whole cloves. She stirs the mixture with a spoon. The spices float and swirl in the dark water. A carton of milk sits on the counter, ready to be added. The sugar jar is nearby. The aroma of cardamom and cinnamon fills the kitchen. On the other burner, another canjeero cooks on the flat pan. Steam rises from both the saucepan and the pan.

### Scene 035: Adding Milk to the Tea
**Time:** 6:22 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove close-up
**Description:** Aisha pours milk from a carton into the saucepan of brewing tea. The milk swirls into the dark spiced liquid, turning it a warm caramel brown. She stirs steadily with a wooden spoon. The cardamom pods and cinnamon stick bob in the creamy mixture. She adds two spoonfuls of sugar from the jar, stirring them in. The shaah bubbles gently. She reduces the flame to a low simmer. The kitchen smells wonderful -- cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and warm milk. A stack of six canjeero sits on the plate now, covered with the cloth.

### Scene 036: Setting the Table
**Time:** 6:25 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Aisha sets the round kitchen table for breakfast. She places five plates -- three full-size and two smaller ones -- around the table with matching glasses. She sets out forks, spoons, and napkins. A jar of honey goes in the center of the table, along with a small bowl of sugar. She places the plate of canjeero, still covered with the cloth, in the center. Five chairs are arranged around the table. Through the kitchen window, the sky is lightening to a gray-blue. The overhead light reflects off the glasses. Basra sits under the table, hoping for scraps.

### Scene 037: Scrambling Eggs
**Time:** 6:27 AM -- kitchen light, stove
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha cracks eggs into a bowl -- one, two, three, four, five, six eggs for the family. She adds a pinch of salt and a dash of cumin from a small spice jar. She whisks them with a fork, the yellow yolks blending into a smooth mixture. A frying pan heats on the stove with a small amount of cooking oil. She pours the beaten eggs into the pan. They sizzle immediately. She stirs them with a wooden spatula, scrambling them gently. The shaah simmers on the back burner. Diced onion and a few chopped tomato pieces sit on a small cutting board, ready to be mixed in.

### Scene 038: Adding Vegetables to Eggs
**Time:** 6:29 AM -- kitchen light, stove
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove close-up
**Description:** Aisha tips the diced onion and chopped tomato from the cutting board into the scrambling eggs. The vegetables sizzle as they hit the hot pan. She stirs everything together with the wooden spatula. The eggs are fluffy and golden, studded with red tomato pieces and translucent onion. A sprinkle of black pepper goes on top. She shakes the pan slightly to distribute the heat. The kitchen timer on the counter shows the time. The shaah on the back burner sends up curls of fragrant steam. The plate of canjeero waits on the table.

### Scene 039: Slicing Bananas
**Time:** 6:31 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Aisha takes two bananas from the fruit bowl on the counter and peels them, dropping the yellow peels into a small trash bin beside the counter. She slices the bananas into round coins on the cutting board with a small kitchen knife. The slices are even and neat. She arranges them on a small plate. An apple also sits in the fruit bowl. The eggs are done, resting in the pan on a turned-off burner. The table is set. The kitchen is warm and full of breakfast smells -- canjeero, eggs, spiced tea, and ripe banana.

### Scene 040: Straining the Tea
**Time:** 6:33 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Aisha holds a fine mesh strainer over a large thermal pot and pours the shaah through it. The spiced tea flows through, caramel-brown and steaming, while the tea leaves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and cloves are caught in the strainer. She taps the strainer on the edge of the pot to shake off the last drops. The spent spices sit in the strainer, fragrant and used up. She sets the strainer in the sink. The thermal pot keeps the tea hot. She carries it to the table and sets it on a trivet beside the honey jar.

### Scene 041: Waking the Children -- Hamza's Door
**Time:** 6:35 AM -- hallway light
**Setting:** Upstairs hallway, at Hamza's bedroom door
**Description:** Aisha stands in the upstairs hallway and knocks firmly on a closed door with a small sign that reads "Hamza" in blue letters. She calls through the door, one hand on the door frame. The hallway is carpeted in beige. Next to Hamza's door is Amina's door with stickers on it, and further down is Zahra's door with a small pink nameplate. The hallway light is on. Family photos on the wall catch the light. From behind Hamza's door, there is no sound -- a teenager in deep sleep. Aisha knocks again, louder.

### Scene 042: Waking Amina
**Time:** 6:36 AM -- Amina's bedroom light
**Setting:** Amina's bedroom doorway, view into room
**Description:** Aisha opens Amina's bedroom door and flips the light switch. The room lights up -- a middle-schooler's room with a twin bed, a desk with school books and a laptop, posters of a soccer team and a pop singer on the wall, a bookshelf, and clothes draped over a chair. Amina, an 11-year-old girl with medium brown skin and dark hair in braids, pulls her blanket over her head. Aisha speaks gently but firmly from the doorway, hand on the light switch. A school backpack sits by the desk, ready for the day.

### Scene 043: Waking Zahra
**Time:** 6:37 AM -- Zahra's bedroom, pink nightlight and overhead light
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha enters little Zahra's bedroom -- a small, cheerful room with pink walls, a toddler bed with a purple comforter printed with stars, a shelf with picture books and stuffed animals (a giraffe, a bunny, a rainbow teddy bear). A pink nightlight glows near the floor. Aisha sits on the edge of the small bed and gently shakes Zahra's shoulder. Zahra, a 5-year-old with medium brown skin and curly dark hair, opens her eyes slowly, clutching a stuffed bunny. She reaches up for Aisha, wanting to be held. Aisha smiles widely, her warm brown eyes crinkling.

### Scene 044: Carrying Zahra Downstairs
**Time:** 6:39 AM -- stairway light
**Setting:** Townhouse stairway, descending
**Description:** Aisha carries Zahra on her hip as she descends the stairway. Zahra wears pajamas with cartoon cats printed on them, and she clutches the stuffed bunny in one arm, the other arm wrapped around Aisha's neck. Zahra's curly dark hair is messy from sleep. Her small face is still drowsy, cheek pressed against Aisha's shoulder. Aisha holds the banister with her free hand. The stairway photos pass beside them. Aisha's blue floral dirac sways with each step. The warm smell of breakfast wafts up from the kitchen below.

### Scene 045: Zahra at the Table
**Time:** 6:41 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Aisha sets Zahra in her chair at the kitchen table, pushing the chair in gently. Zahra sits with the stuffed bunny on her lap, still blinking sleepily. The table is set with plates, glasses, and the covered canjeero. Aisha places a small plate with banana slices in front of Zahra. The little girl picks up a banana slice with her fingers and nibbles it. Her cat-print pajamas are rumpled. Basra the orange tabby sits on the floor nearby, watching Zahra with his amber eyes. The thermal pot of shaah steams on the table.

### Scene 046: Hamza Appears
**Time:** 6:43 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, doorway
**Description:** Hamza, a tall 15-year-old boy with medium brown skin, short-cropped dark hair, and a lanky build, shuffles into the kitchen in sweatpants and a high school basketball t-shirt. He carries his phone in one hand. His eyes are half-closed with sleep. He drops into a chair at the table and immediately reaches for the canjeero, pulling a piece off with his fingers. Aisha, standing at the stove spooning scrambled eggs onto a serving plate, gives him a look -- wash your hands first. He gets back up with a sigh.

### Scene 047: Amina at the Table
**Time:** 6:44 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Amina enters the kitchen dressed in jeans and a long-sleeved top, her dark hair already in neat braids. At 11, she is organized and ready before her older brother. She sits at the table and pours herself a glass of orange juice from a carton. She greets Zahra, who waves a banana slice at her. Amina's school backpack sits on the floor by her chair. She straightens a napkin on her lap. The scrambled eggs, now on a serving plate, sit in the center of the table beside the canjeero. Basra rubs against Amina's chair leg.

### Scene 048: Serving Breakfast
**Time:** 6:46 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Aisha brings the serving plate of scrambled eggs to the table and sets it down with a serving spoon. The table is now full: the plate of golden canjeero, scrambled eggs with tomato and onion, banana slices, honey jar, sugar bowl, orange juice carton, and the thermal pot of shaah. Three children sit around the table -- Hamza (back from washing hands), Amina, and Zahra with her bunny. Aisha stands at the head of the table, serving eggs onto Zahra's small plate first. The kitchen is warm and full of breakfast aromas.

### Scene 049: Family Eating Breakfast
**Time:** 6:48 AM -- kitchen light, gray winter light through window
**Setting:** Family kitchen, wide table view
**Description:** The family eats breakfast together at the round kitchen table. Hamza tears off pieces of canjeero and scoops scrambled eggs with them -- the traditional way. Amina eats with a fork, eggs on her plate beside a piece of canjeero spread with honey. Zahra eats banana slices and small torn pieces of canjeero that Aisha has placed on her plate. Aisha sits with her own plate, eating and watching her children. A cup of shaah steams at her place. Through the kitchen window, gray Minneapolis winter light grows. Basra sits under Zahra's chair, vigilant for dropped food.

### Scene 050: Pouring Shaah for Herself
**Time:** 6:50 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table close-up
**Description:** Aisha pours shaah from the thermal pot into a ceramic mug. The spiced tea is a rich caramel brown, steaming as it fills the mug. She wraps both hands around the warm mug and takes a slow sip, closing her eyes for a moment. The cardamom and cinnamon flavor is comforting and familiar. Around her, the children eat and talk -- Hamza scrolling his phone between bites, Amina telling a story about school, Zahra humming to her stuffed bunny. This is Aisha's brief moment of calm before the rush. The mug is cream-colored with a small chip on the handle.

### Scene 051: Clearing Zahra's Plate
**Time:** 6:52 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Aisha wipes Zahra's face with a damp cloth, cleaning egg and banana from the little girl's cheeks. Zahra squirms and giggles. Her cat-print pajamas have a small smear of egg on the front. The stuffed bunny sits on the table beside the plate. Aisha stacks Zahra's empty plate on top of her own and carries them to the sink. The kitchen table still has some dishes on it. Hamza has already left the table, his plate in the sink. Amina is finishing her juice. Basra licks at an egg crumb on the floor.

### Scene 052: Hamza Packs His Bag
**Time:** 6:54 AM -- hallway
**Setting:** Townhouse front hallway, by door
**Description:** Hamza stands by the front door, stuffing a binder into his school backpack -- a black backpack with a basketball keychain hanging from the zipper. He wears a winter coat -- a puffy dark blue parka -- and pulls a knit beanie over his short hair. A pair of heavy winter boots sits by the door. Gloves and a scarf hang on hooks above a shoe rack. The front door has a small window showing the dark, cold Minneapolis morning outside. Hamza zips up the backpack and slings it over one shoulder.

### Scene 053: Hamza Leaves for School
**Time:** 6:55 AM -- front door, gray winter light
**Setting:** Townhouse front door
**Description:** Aisha stands at the open front door as Hamza heads out. A blast of cold Minneapolis winter air enters -- the porch light shows frost on the railing. Hamza is bundled in his parka, beanie, and gloves, backpack on his shoulders. He waves without looking back, earbuds already in. Aisha calls after him to be careful. The sidewalk outside is cleared of snow but the yards are white. A streetlight still glows in the early morning gray. Aisha hugs herself against the cold, her dirac not enough for the freezing air. She closes the door quickly.

### Scene 054: Packing Amina's Lunch
**Time:** 6:57 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Aisha stands at the kitchen counter packing a lunch into a reusable lunch bag -- a purple insulated bag. She places a container of leftover rice and chicken (bariis and hilib), a small bag of baby carrots, an apple, and a juice box inside. A sheet of wax paper separates the items. She zips the bag closed. On the counter, a second smaller lunch bag -- Zahra's, pink with flowers -- waits to be packed. The kitchen shows the aftermath of breakfast: dirty dishes in the sink, crumbs on the table, the empty canjeero plate.

### Scene 055: Packing Zahra's Lunch
**Time:** 6:59 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter close-up
**Description:** Aisha packs Zahra's small pink lunch bag with care: a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich cut into four triangles in a container, a small bag of goldfish crackers, a banana, and a sippy cup of water. She tucks a paper napkin inside -- a white napkin with a small heart drawn on it in marker, a daily note for Zahra. She zips the little bag and sets it beside Amina's purple lunch bag. Two packed lunches ready. The kitchen clock on the wall shows nearly 7:00.

### Scene 056: Helping Zahra Get Dressed
**Time:** 7:01 AM -- Zahra's bedroom light
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha helps Zahra change out of her cat-print pajamas. Zahra stands on the small bed in her underwear while Aisha pulls a pink long-sleeved shirt over her head. Zahra's curly dark hair pops through the collar, sticking up with static. Warm leggings with purple stripes are next. Zahra lifts one foot, then the other, wobbling and giggling. Aisha steadies her with a patient hand. The stuffed animals watch from the shelf -- giraffe, bunny, rainbow bear. The purple star comforter is rumpled on the bed.

### Scene 057: Brushing Zahra's Hair
**Time:** 7:04 AM -- Zahra's bedroom light
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom, sitting on bed edge
**Description:** Aisha sits on the edge of Zahra's small bed with the little girl standing between her knees. She gently brushes Zahra's curly dark hair with a wide-toothed comb, working out the sleep tangles. Zahra holds perfectly still, though her face scrunches when the comb catches a knot. A small basket of hair accessories sits beside Aisha on the bed -- colorful hair ties, clips, and small bows. Aisha smooths the hair back and begins parting it down the middle. The pink walls of the room glow in the overhead light.

### Scene 058: Two Little Puffs
**Time:** 7:07 AM -- Zahra's bedroom light
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom, close-up
**Description:** Aisha finishes Zahra's hair, pulling the curls into two round puffs -- one on each side of her head -- secured with purple hair ties. Zahra grins widely, showing a gap where she lost a baby tooth. Aisha cups her daughter's small round face in her hands and kisses her forehead. The hair comb and extra ties lie on the bed. Zahra twirls, making her puffs bounce. She is wearing the pink shirt and purple-striped leggings. Aisha laughs -- her wide, warm smile lighting up her round face.

### Scene 059: Aisha in the Bathroom -- Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 7:10 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Master bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Aisha stands at the bathroom sink brushing her teeth with a blue toothbrush. White toothpaste foam is at the corners of her mouth. She looks at herself in the mirror -- dark hair still in the bun, wearing the blue floral dirac. The small bathroom counter holds her toothbrush holder (with four toothbrushes of different colors for the family), a tube of toothpaste, the soap dispenser, and her comb. She brushes in steady circular motions. The bright overhead light is unforgiving in its clarity. The towel rack holds the white and blue towels.

### Scene 060: Washing Face
**Time:** 7:12 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Master bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Aisha splashes water on her face at the sink, then applies a small amount of face cream from a jar on the counter. She rubs the cream into her medium brown skin in gentle circles -- forehead, cheeks, nose, chin. She pats her face dry with a small towel. In the mirror, her round face looks refreshed and awake. Her warm brown eyes are bright. She straightens up and puts the cap back on the face cream jar. The soap dispenser, comb, and hair ties sit in their places on the counter. Water droplets dot the mirror.

### Scene 061: Putting On the Hijab -- Preparation
**Time:** 7:15 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at dresser mirror
**Description:** Aisha stands at the dresser looking in the small mirror attached to the wall. She has changed into her restaurant work clothes: a cream-colored long-sleeved tunic top over dark comfortable pants, with closed-toe black shoes. She picks up the teal hijab she selected earlier -- a large square of soft fabric. She holds an under-cap (a snug cotton cap that holds the hair in place) in her other hand. Her dark hair is still in the neat bun. The mirror reflects the dresser top with its colorful hijab collection. Basra sits on the bed behind her, watching.

### Scene 062: Putting On the Under-Cap
**Time:** 7:16 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at dresser mirror close-up
**Description:** Aisha pulls the black cotton under-cap over her hair, tucking in any stray strands at the edges. The cap is snug and covers all her hair, sitting just above her eyebrows and behind her ears. She adjusts it with both hands, making sure it is smooth and comfortable. In the mirror, her round face is framed neatly by the black cap. Her brown eyes look focused. The teal hijab fabric is draped over her shoulder, ready to be wrapped. The dresser surface shows a pin cushion with straight pins for securing the hijab.

### Scene 063: Wrapping the Hijab
**Time:** 7:17 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at dresser mirror
**Description:** Aisha drapes the teal hijab over her head, the fabric falling evenly on both sides. She takes the left side and brings it under her chin and over her right shoulder. She adjusts the drape with practiced hands -- smooth, even, modest. The teal fabric frames her round brown face. She pulls a straight pin from the pin cushion and secures the hijab under her chin with a small, discreet pin. The color brings out the warmth in her brown eyes. She turns her head left, then right, checking the coverage in the mirror. Neat and ready.

### Scene 064: Putting On the Apron
**Time:** 7:19 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, standing
**Description:** Aisha takes a clean white apron from a hook on the closet door and ties it around her waist. The apron goes over the cream tunic, the strings wrapping around and tying in a bow at her back. She adjusts the bib of the apron over her chest, smoothing it flat. She is now fully dressed for work: teal hijab, cream tunic, dark pants, black shoes, white apron. She picks up her phone from the nightstand and puts it in the apron pocket. The bedroom is neat -- bed made, prayer rug folded, dresser organized. Basra is asleep on the bed again.

### Scene 065: Gathering Bags at the Front Door
**Time:** 7:22 AM -- front hallway
**Setting:** Townhouse front hallway
**Description:** Aisha gathers bags at the front door. She sets down her large purse -- a practical dark brown shoulder bag -- and the two lunch bags (Amina's purple, Zahra's pink). Her car keys dangle from one hand. Amina stands by the door in her winter coat -- a red puffy jacket -- with her backpack on her shoulders. She holds her phone. Zahra is bundled in a lavender puffy coat, purple snow boots, and pink mittens, clutching the stuffed bunny. A winter hat with a pom-pom is on Zahra's head, squishing her puffs. The shoe rack and coat hooks are full.

### Scene 066: Putting On Her Winter Coat
**Time:** 7:23 AM -- front hallway
**Setting:** Townhouse front hallway
**Description:** Aisha pulls on her long black winter coat over the apron and tunic. The coat is heavy, reaching past her knees -- necessary for Minneapolis winters. She winds a cream-colored scarf around her neck over the teal hijab. She pulls on black gloves. Her purse goes over her shoulder. She checks herself in the small hallway mirror -- teal hijab visible above the cream scarf, black coat, warm and modest. She hands Amina her purple lunch bag and tucks Zahra's pink lunch bag into the side pocket of her purse. The front door awaits.

### Scene 067: Walking to the Minivan
**Time:** 7:25 AM -- gray winter morning light, cold
**Setting:** Townhouse driveway / street, outside
**Description:** Aisha walks down the townhouse front steps onto the shoveled concrete path, holding Zahra's mittened hand. Amina walks ahead toward the silver Honda Odyssey minivan parked on the street. The morning is gray and bitterly cold -- their breath makes white clouds in the air. A thin layer of frost covers the minivan's windows. The townhouse row stretches behind them, similar three-story buildings with small front yards. Bare trees line the street. A few neighbors' lights are on. Aisha presses the key fob and the minivan's lights flash.

### Scene 068: Scraping Frost from the Windshield
**Time:** 7:27 AM -- gray winter morning
**Setting:** Street, at minivan
**Description:** Aisha stands outside the silver Honda Odyssey using a long-handled plastic ice scraper to clear frost from the windshield. She scrapes in firm, even strokes, peeling away the thin layer of ice to reveal the glass beneath. Her black gloves grip the scraper handle. Her breath forms clouds of white vapor. The teal hijab peeks above the cream scarf. Inside the minivan, Amina has already climbed in and buckled her seatbelt. Zahra is buckled in her booster seat in the back, hugging the bunny. The engine runs, warming up. Frost curls off the windshield in thin sheets.

### Scene 069: Driving to School -- Inside the Minivan
**Time:** 7:32 AM -- gray winter morning, dashboard lights
**Setting:** Inside the Honda Odyssey, driving
**Description:** Aisha drives the silver minivan through Minneapolis residential streets. Her gloved hands grip the steering wheel. The dashboard shows the heater on full blast, temperature display reading 12 degrees Fahrenheit outside. The teal hijab and cream scarf frame her focused face. In the rearview mirror, Zahra is visible in her booster seat, chatting to the stuffed bunny. Amina sits in the middle row looking at her phone. The streets are plowed but gray, with snowbanks lining the curbs. Other cars have their headlights on. Traffic is light -- the neighborhood is waking up.

### Scene 070: Dropping Off at Elementary School
**Time:** 7:40 AM -- gray winter morning
**Setting:** Elementary school drop-off area
**Description:** The silver minivan pulls up in the school drop-off lane. Aisha parks briefly and gets out to unbuckle Zahra from the booster seat. The elementary school building is a brick building with a colorful sign out front. Other parents' cars idle in the lane. Children in winter coats and backpacks stream toward the entrance. Aisha crouches down and zips Zahra's coat all the way up, adjusts her pom-pom hat, and hands her the pink lunch bag. Zahra hugs Aisha's neck tightly. Aisha kisses her forehead through the coat collar. A teacher stands at the school door, waving children in.

### Scene 071: Zahra Walks In
**Time:** 7:42 AM -- gray winter morning
**Setting:** Elementary school entrance
**Description:** Zahra toddles toward the school entrance in her lavender puffy coat, purple snow boots, and pom-pom hat, the pink lunch bag swinging from one hand and the stuffed bunny under her arm. She turns and waves at Aisha with a mittened hand, her small round face beaming. A friend runs up to meet her -- another small child in a green coat. They walk in together. Aisha waves from beside the minivan, her black coat and teal hijab visible. She watches until Zahra disappears through the school door. Other parents wave and drive off.

### Scene 072: Dropping Off Amina at Middle School
**Time:** 7:50 AM -- gray winter morning
**Setting:** Middle school drop-off area
**Description:** The minivan pulls up at the middle school, a larger building with a wide front entrance. Amina slides the van door open and hops out with her backpack and purple lunch bag. She wears the red puffy jacket, a knit headband over her braids, and winter boots. She waves quickly to Aisha through the window -- a pre-teen wave, brief and casual. Other middle-schoolers stream past in groups. Aisha calls out the window to have a good day. Amina nods and merges into the flow of students. The minivan idles, exhaust forming a white cloud in the cold.

### Scene 073: Driving to the Restaurant
**Time:** 7:55 AM -- gray winter morning, city streets
**Setting:** Inside the minivan, driving through Minneapolis
**Description:** Aisha drives through Minneapolis streets toward the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. The route passes through residential blocks, past a mosque with a green dome, small shops with signs in Somali and English, and a Somali mall. The dashboard clock reads 7:55. She passes the intersection of Cedar Avenue -- the heart of the Somali community. Pedestrians in winter coats and hijabs walk on the sidewalks. Aisha knows every corner of this neighborhood. Her phone, mounted on a dashboard holder, shows a text from a staff member. She waits until she parks to read it.

### Scene 074: Parking Behind the Restaurant
**Time:** 8:05 AM -- gray winter morning
**Setting:** Small parking area behind Hoyo's Kitchen
**Description:** Aisha pulls the silver minivan into a small parking spot behind a one-story commercial building. A sign on the back door reads "Hoyo's Kitchen - Staff Only." A dumpster and recycling bins sit against the building wall. The parking area has been plowed but patches of ice remain. She turns off the engine, gathers her purse and phone, and steps out into the cold. Her boots crunch on the icy pavement. She locks the minivan with a beep of the key fob. She walks carefully to the back door, pulling a ring of keys from her purse.

### Scene 075: Unlocking the Restaurant
**Time:** 8:07 AM -- restaurant back entrance
**Setting:** Back door of Hoyo's Kitchen
**Description:** Aisha inserts a key into the deadbolt of the heavy metal back door and turns it. The lock clicks. She pushes the door open and reaches inside for the light switch. Fluorescent lights flicker on, illuminating the commercial kitchen of Hoyo's Kitchen. The stainless steel surfaces gleam. The room is cold -- the heat was turned down overnight. She steps inside, stamping snow from her boots on a rubber mat. The door closes behind her with a heavy thud. The kitchen is quiet and still, waiting for the day to begin. She hangs her winter coat and scarf on a hook by the door.

### Scene 076: Turning On the Kitchen
**Time:** 8:10 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen commercial kitchen, wide view
**Description:** Aisha moves through the commercial kitchen, turning things on. She flips the thermostat up -- the heating unit hums to life. She turns on the commercial gas stove, checking each burner with a click-click-whoosh of blue flame. She switches on the large commercial rice cooker. She checks the walk-in refrigerator, opening the heavy door and glancing at the shelves of ingredients -- trays of marinated chicken, bags of basmati rice, containers of chopped vegetables. The stainless steel prep tables are clean from last night. Order tickets from yesterday's last orders still hang on the wire above the pass.

### Scene 077: Checking the Inventory
**Time:** 8:15 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at walk-in refrigerator
**Description:** Aisha stands at the open walk-in refrigerator with a clipboard and pen, checking inventory. She counts containers: marinated chicken pieces, ground beef, diced onions, tomato sauce, bags of frozen sambusa wrappers. She notes what needs to be reordered. Her breath is visible in the cold refrigerator air. The shelves are organized with labels in Aisha's handwriting. A box marked "Halal Chicken" sits on the middle shelf. She taps the pen against the clipboard, mentally planning today's prep. Her teal hijab and cream tunic are visible under the white apron. The heavy refrigerator door is propped open.

### Scene 078: Washing Hands at the Station
**Time:** 8:20 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, hand-washing station
**Description:** Aisha washes her hands at the hand-washing station near the kitchen entrance. She pumps soap from a wall-mounted dispenser onto her palms and lathers thoroughly -- between fingers, under nails, up to the wrists. Hot water runs from the faucet. A sign above the station reads "Wash Hands" with an illustration of hands under water. A paper towel dispenser sits on the wall beside the sink. She dries her hands with a paper towel and drops it in a foot-pedal trash can. Her white apron is clean and crisp. The kitchen is warming up now.

### Scene 079: Tying a Fresh Apron
**Time:** 8:22 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, near apron hooks
**Description:** Aisha hangs her travel apron on a hook and takes a fresh, clean white apron from a stack on a shelf. She unfolds it and slips the loop over her head, then ties the strings behind her back in a firm bow. The apron covers her cream tunic from chest to knees. A row of hooks on the wall holds other aprons -- one blue, one white with stains, and a spare. Below the hooks, a small shelf holds clean kitchen towels folded in a stack. Aisha tucks a kitchen towel into her apron string at the hip. Ready for prep.

### Scene 080: Soaking Basmati Rice
**Time:** 8:25 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha pours a large bag of basmati rice into a deep stainless steel bowl on the prep table. The long white grains pour out in a stream, making a soft hissing sound. She fills the bowl with cold water from a pitcher, and the rice clouds the water milky white. She swirls the rice with her hand, washing it, then tilts the bowl carefully to drain the starchy water into the sink. She refills with fresh water to soak. The bag of rice -- labeled in both English and Somali -- sits on the table. The rice needs to soak before cooking.

### Scene 081: Chopping Onions
**Time:** 8:28 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha stands at the stainless steel prep table, a large cutting board in front of her, chopping onions with a sharp chef's knife. She cuts each onion in half, peels off the papery skin, and dices it into small even pieces. Her brown hands move with practiced speed. Tears form in her warm brown eyes from the onion fumes. A growing pile of diced white onion covers one side of the cutting board. A container waits to receive the chopped onions. The knife catches the fluorescent light with each downward stroke. Onion skins collect near the edge of the table.

### Scene 082: Mincing Garlic
**Time:** 8:32 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table close-up
**Description:** Aisha peels garlic cloves, pressing each one with the flat of the chef's knife to crack the papery skin. She peels away the skin and drops the naked clove onto the cutting board. Then she minces the garlic finely, the knife rocking back and forth rapidly. A strong garlic aroma rises from the cutting board. A small bowl collects the minced garlic. Six or seven cloves are done, a small mountain of fragrant minced garlic. The onion container sits beside it. Her hands are expert and fast. The stainless steel table is clean around the cutting board.

### Scene 083: Marinating Chicken for Suqaar
**Time:** 8:36 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha takes a tray of cubed chicken from the walk-in refrigerator and sets it on the prep table. The chicken is already cut into small bite-sized pieces -- halal chicken breast. She adds spices from the rack: cumin (brown powder), coriander (gold-green powder), turmeric (bright yellow), salt, and black pepper. She squeezes lemon juice from a halved lemon over the chicken. She adds a splash of cooking oil. With gloved hands, she massages the spices into every piece. The chicken turns golden from the turmeric. This is the base for suqaar, a Somali stir-fried meat dish.

### Scene 084: Preparing Sambusa Filling
**Time:** 8:42 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha heats oil in a large saucepan on the commercial gas stove. She adds a portion of the diced onion, which sizzles and softens. Then she adds ground beef from a container, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. The meat browns, releasing savory aromas. She adds minced garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and a pinch of chili flakes. She stirs steadily. A container of frozen sambusa wrappers thaws on the prep table nearby. The exhaust hood over the stove hums, pulling up the cooking smoke. The kitchen is warming and filling with delicious smells.

### Scene 085: Staff Arrives -- Fatima
**Time:** 8:50 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, back door
**Description:** The back door opens and Fatima enters -- a young Somali American woman in her mid-twenties, wearing a purple hijab, a dark long-sleeved top, and jeans under a clean apron she pulls on immediately. She stamps snow from her boots on the rubber mat. She greets Aisha warmly in Somali, then switches to English. Aisha welcomes her and gestures toward the prep table where tasks are waiting. Fatima hangs her coat on a hook, washes her hands at the hand-washing station, and ties on her apron. The kitchen has a second worker now. The ground beef filling simmers on the stove.

### Scene 086: Staff Arrives -- Omar
**Time:** 8:55 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, back door
**Description:** Omar arrives next -- a Somali American man in his thirties, tall, wearing a white kufi (prayer cap), a dark long-sleeved shirt, and kitchen pants. He greets Aisha and Fatima with a nod and a smile. He hangs his winter jacket on a hook, washes his hands, and ties on a blue apron. Aisha assigns him to the stove -- he will handle the rice and meat dishes today. Omar checks the burners, adjusts the flame, and begins setting up large pots. The three-person kitchen team is assembled. Aisha reviews the day's orders from a paper pinned to a clipboard on the wall.

### Scene 087: Reviewing Catering Orders
**Time:** 9:00 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at order station
**Description:** Aisha stands at a small desk near the service window, reading through catering order forms. A phone sits on the desk, along with a calculator, a pen, and a stack of order tickets. She reads through today's orders: a catering tray of bariis and hilib for an office party (feeds 20), a dozen sambusas for a family, and the regular lunch service menu. She writes notes on the orders with the pen -- quantities, timing, special requests. Through the service window, the dark front dining area is visible, chairs still upside-down on tables. She clips the orders to the wire above the pass.

### Scene 088: Folding Sambusas
**Time:** 9:10 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha and Fatima stand side by side at the prep table, folding sambusas. A tray of thawed sambusa wrappers (thin triangular pastry sheets) lies between them, along with the bowl of seasoned ground beef filling. Aisha takes a wrapper, spoons a tablespoon of filling onto one corner, then folds the wrapper into a tight triangle, pressing the edges to seal them. Her hands move quickly -- fold, tuck, press, seal. A tray of finished sambusas grows beside them, neat golden triangles lined up in rows. Fatima follows the same rhythm. A small bowl of water helps seal the edges.

### Scene 089: Heating the Deep Fryer
**Time:** 9:20 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at deep fryer
**Description:** Aisha switches on the commercial deep fryer, and the oil begins to heat. The fryer is a stainless steel box with a wire basket, filled with vegetable oil. A thermometer clip sits on the edge, showing the oil temperature rising. Aisha checks the temperature -- it needs to reach 350 degrees for the sambusas. The fryer sits on its own section of counter away from the stove. A splatter guard leans against the wall nearby. The trays of folded sambusas wait on the prep table. The kitchen smells of seasoned beef and warming oil. Omar is at the stove, stirring a large pot.

### Scene 090: Frying Sambusas
**Time:** 9:28 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light, oil bubbling
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at deep fryer
**Description:** Aisha carefully lowers sambusas into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Four sambusas at a time -- the oil bubbles and crackles around them. The pastry immediately begins to turn golden. She watches them carefully, using the slotted spoon to turn each one so they cook evenly. After three minutes, the sambusas are deep golden brown and crispy. She lifts them out with the slotted spoon and places them on a tray lined with paper towels to drain. Oil drips off the crispy triangles. The smell of fried sambusa fills the kitchen. She lowers the next batch into the oil.

### Scene 091: Cooking Bariis -- Washing Rice
**Time:** 9:35 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Omar drains the soaked basmati rice into a large colander in the sink. The water runs milky at first, then clearer. He shakes the colander gently. Meanwhile, Aisha sets up a large commercial pot on the stove and adds water, a tablespoon of oil, a cinnamon stick, two cardamom pods, and salt. She brings it to a boil. The steam rises. The spice rack on the wall behind the stove shows its colorful jars -- cumin (brown), turmeric (yellow), coriander (green-gold), cinnamon sticks (reddish-brown), cardamom pods (pale green). Omar brings the drained rice to the stove.

### Scene 092: Adding Rice to the Pot
**Time:** 9:40 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Omar pours the drained basmati rice into the boiling spiced water. The rice hisses as it hits the water, then settles. Aisha adjusts the flame to medium-low and places a tight-fitting lid on the pot. Steam escapes around the edges. The rice will cook for about 20 minutes. Aisha sets a kitchen timer on the counter -- a small digital timer that she presses with her thumb. The large pot takes up one whole burner. On other burners, the sambusa filling pot has been emptied and washed, and a fresh pot waits for the suqaar. The kitchen is organized and flowing.

### Scene 093: Starting the Suqaar
**Time:** 9:45 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha heats a large frying pan on the commercial stove with oil. When the oil shimmers, she adds the marinated chicken pieces from the tray. The chicken sizzles loudly as it hits the hot pan, the turmeric turning the oil yellow. She spreads the pieces evenly with a large metal spatula. The smell of cumin, coriander, and turmeric fills the air. She does not stir yet -- she lets the chicken sear and brown on the bottom. The exhaust hood pulls the cooking smoke upward. Her white apron has a small yellow turmeric stain. Fatima preps vegetables at the table behind her.

### Scene 094: Adding Vegetables to Suqaar
**Time:** 9:50 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha flips the chicken pieces -- they are golden brown on the seared side. She adds diced onion, minced garlic, and sliced bell peppers (green and red) to the pan. The vegetables sizzle and soften around the chicken. She stirs everything together with the metal spatula. She adds a splash of tomato paste from a can and stirs it in -- the sauce turns a rich reddish-gold. A squeeze of lemon juice brightens the color. She adds salt to taste. The suqaar bubbles gently. The kitchen is full of layered aromas -- spiced chicken, sauteed peppers, rice with cinnamon.

### Scene 095: Checking the Rice
**Time:** 9:55 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** The kitchen timer beeps. Aisha lifts the lid from the large rice pot, and a cloud of fragrant steam rises -- cinnamon and cardamom. She uses a fork to fluff the basmati rice gently, checking that the grains are cooked through but still separate and fluffy, not mushy. The rice is perfect -- long white grains with the subtle golden tint from the spices. She replaces the lid, turns off the burner, and lets it rest. The cinnamon stick is visible among the grains. She sets the timer for another 10 minutes of resting time. The pot lid fogs with steam.

### Scene 096: Preparing Banana for Bariis
**Time:** 10:00 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Fatima slices bananas on the prep table -- a traditional accompaniment to bariis (Somali rice). The yellow banana rounds are arranged on a small tray. Meanwhile, Aisha prepares a raisin and cashew garnish for the catering tray: she toasts cashews in a small dry pan until golden, shaking the pan gently, and plumps raisins in warm water. The toasted cashews go into a small bowl. The raisins are drained. These will be scattered over the rice for the office catering order. The small pan sizzles. The cashews are pale gold and fragrant.

### Scene 097: Answering the Phone
**Time:** 10:05 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at desk near service window
**Description:** The phone on the desk rings. Aisha wipes her hands on the kitchen towel tucked in her apron and picks it up. She holds the phone to her ear with one hand, reaching for the pen and order pad with the other. She listens, nodding, then writes: a new catering order for Friday -- 30 sambusas and a large tray of suqaar with rice. She repeats the order back to confirm, writes the customer's name and phone number. She thanks the caller and hangs up. She tears the order sheet off and pins it to the clipboard. Business is steady.

### Scene 098: Making Somali Salad
**Time:** 10:10 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha chops vegetables for salad at the prep table: she dices ripe tomatoes, slices thin rounds of red onion, and chops fresh cilantro. She squeezes lime juice over the mixture in a large stainless steel bowl and adds a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and a pinch of chili flakes. She tosses the salad gently with two spoons. The tomatoes are red and juicy, the onion rings purple-white, the cilantro bright green. This simple salad accompanies many Somali dishes. The lime halves rest on the cutting board. The bowl of salad is covered with plastic wrap and set in the walk-in refrigerator.

### Scene 099: Setting Up the Service Window
**Time:** 10:20 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at service window/pass
**Description:** Aisha sets up the service window area, the pass between the kitchen and the dining room. She wipes down the stainless steel shelf with a clean cloth. She organizes the ticket wire -- removing yesterday's old tickets and clipping today's orders. A stack of takeout containers (styrofoam, various sizes) sits on a shelf beside the window. Paper bags for takeout are stacked nearby. Through the window, the dining room is still dark. She places serving spoons on the shelf -- large metal spoons for rice, slotted spoons for meat. The menu board on the dining room wall is visible through the window.

### Scene 100: Turning On the Dining Room
**Time:** 10:25 AM -- dining room overhead lights
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, wide view
**Description:** Aisha walks through the swinging door from the kitchen into the small dining room and turns on the lights. The room has about eight tables, each with four chairs. The walls are painted warm orange with framed photos of Somali landscapes -- beaches, camels, colorful markets. A large menu board hangs on one wall, listing dishes in English with Somali names: Bariis iyo Hilib (Rice with Meat), Suqaar (Stir-Fried Meat), Sambusa, Canjeero, Shaah Cadays (Spiced Tea). She flips chairs down from the tables. A small counter near the entrance serves as the cash register area.

### Scene 101: Wiping Tables
**Time:** 10:28 AM -- dining room lights
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room
**Description:** Aisha wipes each table with a damp cloth, cleaning the surface in smooth circular motions. The tables are simple laminate-topped tables, sturdy and practical. She straightens the chairs around each table -- four per table. A napkin holder and a small bottle of hot sauce sit on each table. She adjusts these as she goes. The framed photos of Somali landscapes catch the light. Through the front windows, the Minneapolis street is visible -- parked cars, snow on the ground, a few pedestrians. The restaurant sign "Hoyo's Kitchen" is visible in reverse through the glass door.

### Scene 102: Turning On the "OPEN" Sign
**Time:** 10:35 AM -- dining room lights, daylight through windows
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen front entrance, interior
**Description:** Aisha walks to the front door and flips the switch on a neon "OPEN" sign hanging in the window. The sign glows red. She unlocks the front door -- a glass door with the restaurant name stenciled on it and the hours: "Mon-Sat 11am-9pm." She peers outside -- the Minneapolis sidewalk is quiet, a few people walking in winter coats. The temperature display on a bank sign across the street reads 18 degrees. She steps back inside, the warm restaurant air a contrast to the cold draft from the door. The dining room is ready. Back in the kitchen, Omar and Fatima continue prep.

### Scene 103: Dhuhr Prayer Break
**Time:** 10:40 AM -- back of restaurant
**Setting:** Small storage/break room behind the kitchen
**Description:** Aisha steps into the small break room behind the kitchen -- a narrow room with a table, two chairs, hooks for coats, and a shelf with personal items. She spreads a small travel prayer rug on the floor, faces the qibla direction, and performs wudu quickly at a small sink. She stands on the rug in her work clothes (teal hijab, cream tunic, apron folded aside), raises her hands to her ears, and begins the Dhuhr (midday) prayer. The room is quiet, separated from the kitchen bustle. Her eyes are closed in concentration. A clock on the wall shows 10:40.

### Scene 104: Completing Dhuhr Prayer
**Time:** 10:48 AM -- back room
**Setting:** Small storage/break room
**Description:** Aisha sits on the prayer rug in the final sitting position, right index finger raised. She turns her head right, then left, completing the prayer with the salaam. She sits still for a moment, hands on her knees, eyes closed, making a brief personal supplication. Then she folds the small travel prayer rug and tucks it on the shelf. She reties her apron, adjusts her teal hijab in a small mirror on the wall, and pushes through the door back into the kitchen. The transition from spiritual quiet to kitchen energy is immediate. Omar is stirring the suqaar. Fatima is chopping onions.

### Scene 105: Assembling the Catering Tray
**Time:** 10:55 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha assembles the catering tray for the office party. She takes a large aluminum foil tray and mounds fluffy bariis (spiced basmati rice) in the center. She arranges pieces of seasoned lamb (hilib) around the rice. She scatters the toasted cashews and plumped raisins over the top. She tucks banana slices around the edges. The presentation is generous and colorful -- white rice, golden-brown meat, pale cashews, dark raisins, yellow banana. She covers the tray tightly with aluminum foil and writes the customer's name on a label. Fatima prepares a second container of salad to go with it.

### Scene 106: First Customer Arrives
**Time:** 11:05 AM -- dining room lights, daylight
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, front entrance
**Description:** The front door opens with a jingle of a small bell, and the first customer enters -- a man in a heavy winter coat and scarf, stamping snow from his boots. He is a regular, greeting Aisha by name as she comes from the kitchen. She smiles her wide, warm smile and gestures to a table. The dining room is warm and inviting, the orange walls glowing. The menu board is visible. The man unzips his coat and sits down. Aisha hands him a laminated menu, though he probably knows it by heart. Through the front window, the "OPEN" sign glows red.

She repeats the order -- "Suqaar plate, extra bariis, one shaah" -- and he confirms. She tears the ticket from the pad and walks back toward the kitchen, pushing through the swinging door. She clips the ticket to the wire above the pass. Omar reads it and begins plating. The dining room is still quiet -- the lunch rush has not started yet.

She places a portion of Somali salad on the plate and a folded piece of canjeero on the side. She adds a lemon wedge. The plate is colorful: white rice, golden-red suqaar, green-red salad, pale canjeero, yellow lemon. She sets the plate on the service window shelf and calls through to the dining room.

**Description:** Aisha carries the loaded plate from the kitchen through the swinging door and sets it before the customer. The plate is steaming. She sets a fork and knife wrapped in a paper napkin beside it. She asks if he wants hot sauce -- he does. She places the small bottle of hot sauce from the table closer to him. The customer inhales the aroma and smiles. Aisha turns back toward the kitchen to prepare the shaah. The orange walls and Somali landscape photos give the dining room a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Other tables are still empty.

### Scene 110: Brewing Fresh Shaah for Customers
**Time:** 11:16 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha makes a fresh pot of shaah on the stove for the day's customers. She boils water in a medium saucepan, adds loose black tea leaves, crushed cardamom pods, a cinnamon stick, and cloves. The spices swirl in the dark water. She adds milk from a large carton and stirs. Sugar goes in -- a generous amount for the customer version. The tea simmers, the aroma filling the kitchen. She stirs with a long spoon. The pot holds enough for about ten cups. She strains it through a fine mesh strainer into a thermal serving pot. The spiced tea is a rich caramel brown.

Aisha moves between tables taking orders, her teal hijab and white apron visible as she weaves through the room. The order pad is in constant use. Through the service window, Omar and Fatima can be seen working at the stove and prep table. The sound of sizzling, clattering dishes, and conversation fills the space. The OPEN sign glows in the window.

### Scene 113: Writing Multiple Orders
**Time:** 11:35 AM -- near service window
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at order wire

Omar reads them quickly: "Two suqaar plates, one bariis with hilib, one sambusa plate, two shaah, one mango juice." He nods and begins working. Fatima plates sambusas -- golden fried triangles arranged on a plate with salad and a dipping sauce. Aisha grabs a tray and begins arranging cups for the drinks. The kitchen moves at full speed. The exhaust hood hums louder. Steam rises from multiple pots.

### Scene 114: Carrying a Tray of Food
**Time:** 11:40 AM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, between tables
**Description:** Aisha carries a large tray balanced on one hand, the other steadying it. The tray holds two plates of bariis with hilib and two cups of shaah on saucers. She navigates between tables with practiced ease, the tray level and steady despite the weight. She sets the first plate before a woman in a black hijab who thanks her. The second plate goes to the man across from her. The shaah cups are placed carefully. Aisha asks if they need anything else. The dining room buzzes with conversation and the clink of forks on plates.

### Scene 115: At the Cash Register
**Time:** 11:50 AM -- dining room, near entrance
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, counter/register area
**Description:** The first customer is ready to pay. Aisha stands behind the small counter near the entrance, an electronic cash register in front of her. She rings up the order -- suqaar plate with extra rice, one shaah -- the register beeping with each item. The total shows on a small screen. The customer hands her a twenty-dollar bill. She opens the cash drawer, makes change, and counts it back to him. She places the receipt in a small tray. A tip jar sits on the counter beside a stack of takeout menus. The customer drops his change into the tip jar and waves goodbye.

### Scene 116: Handling Takeout Orders
**Time:** 12:00 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at service window

She adds a piece of canjeero wrapped in foil and two sambusas in a paper bag. She fits everything into a plastic bag with handles. A receipt is stapled to the bag. Through the service window, a customer waits at the front counter. She carries the bag out and hands it over with a smile. The customer pays and leaves, the door bell jingling. Cold air rushes in briefly. Aisha returns to the kitchen.

**Time:** 12:10 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, moving between tables
**Description:** Aisha carries a large pitcher of ice water through the dining room, refilling glasses at each table. The water splashes into glasses with ice cubes, clear and cold. She moves from table to table efficiently, the pitcher in her right hand, a folded towel in her left to catch drips. The tables are full of plates, cups, napkins, and the small hot sauce bottles. Customers eat and talk. The dining room is warm despite the cold outside -- the orange walls, the photos, the smell of spiced food. Aisha exchanges a few words with each table as she refills.

### Scene 118: Quick Kitchen Check
**Time:** 12:20 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen and does a quick check. She lifts the lid on the large pot of bariis -- still plenty of rice. She checks the suqaar pan -- running low. She tells Omar to start another batch. She checks the sambusa tray -- six left from this morning. She asks Fatima to fry more. She checks the salad container in the walk-in -- half full. She refills the shaah thermal pot from the stove. The kitchen is hot from the stove and fryer. Aisha's face is flushed and a few wisps of hair escape at the edge of her teal hijab. She pushes them back in.

**Time:** 12:25 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light, stove flame
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha takes over the stove from Omar while he handles the deep fryer. She heats oil in the large frying pan and adds more marinated chicken pieces. They sizzle loudly. She spreads them with the metal spatula, letting them sear. She adds onions and bell peppers -- the colorful red and green strips hit the hot pan and steam. She works quickly, stirring and flipping. The spice aromas intensify -- cumin, turmeric, coriander. Sweat beads on her forehead. She wipes it with the back of her gloved hand. The exhaust hood works hard. The second batch of suqaar comes together fast.

### Scene 120: A Family Comes In
**Time:** 12:35 PM -- dining room, busy
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, entrance

The mother greets Aisha warmly in Somali, and they exchange cheek kisses. Aisha leads them to the largest table and pulls a high chair from the corner for the toddler.

### Scene 121: Making Mango Juice
**Time:** 12:40 PM -- behind the counter
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, behind front counter
**Description:** Aisha pours mango juice from a large carton into tall glasses with ice. The juice is thick, golden-orange, and sweet.

A stack of napkins, straws, and the takeout menu stand are organized behind the counter. The cash register sits to one side. Through the dining room, the warm orange walls and full tables are visible. Aisha carries the tray of juice to the family's table.

### Scene 122: Peak Lunch Rush
**Time:** 12:50 PM -- dining room and kitchen, full energy
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, view from service window

Through the service window, Omar plates dishes rapidly, spooning rice and meat with practiced hands. Fatima arranges sambusas and salads. Order tickets crowd the wire. Aisha's forehead gleams with effort. Her teal hijab is slightly askew. Her white apron has turmeric stains and a splash of sauce. She has not sat down in hours. The restaurant hums with life.

### Scene 123: Greeting a Regular
**Time:** 1:00 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, near entrance
**Description:** A man in a business suit enters -- clearly from a nearby office. He is not Somali but is a regular customer who discovered the restaurant months ago. Aisha greets him by name with her wide smile. He orders "the usual" -- a lamb bariis plate with extra salad and shaah. Aisha nods without writing it down; she knows. He takes his regular table by the window, hanging his coat on the chair. Through the window behind him, Minneapolis traffic moves on the snowy street. The OPEN sign casts a red glow on the condensation on the glass.

### Scene 124: Washing Dishes
**Time:** 1:10 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at kitchen sink
**Description:** Between rushes, Fatima washes dishes at the large commercial sink, scrubbing plates under hot running water and stacking them in the dish rack to dry. Aisha brings a bus tub of dirty dishes from the dining room -- stacked plates, cups, silverware, crumpled napkins. She sets the heavy tub beside the sink. The sink has two basins -- wash and rinse. Soap suds pile up in the wash basin. Clean plates steam on the drying rack. The kitchen floor near the sink is damp. Aisha grabs a clean stack of plates to bring to the service window for more plating.

### Scene 125: Afternoon Slowing Down
**Time:** 1:30 PM -- dining room, calmer
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, wide view

Through the front window, the afternoon sky is a flat Minneapolis gray. Aisha's movements are slower now -- the sustained rush is over.

### Scene 126: Eating Her Own Lunch
**Time:** 1:45 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room behind kitchen
**Description:** Aisha finally sits down to eat in the small break room. She has a plate of bariis and suqaar on the table, a piece of canjeero, and a cup of shaah. She eats with her right hand, tearing canjeero and scooping rice and chicken -- the traditional way. Her feet ache from standing for hours; she has slipped off her shoes under the table. Her teal hijab is slightly loosened. She eats slowly, savoring the food she cooked. Her phone sits on the table -- a text from Abdi asking how the lunch rush went. She types a quick reply between bites. The break room is quiet.

### Scene 127: Checking Her Phone
**Time:** 1:55 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room
**Description:** Aisha scrolls through her phone while finishing her shaah. She checks messages: a text from Hamza asking if he can go to a friend's house after school (she types "homework first"), a notification from Zahra's kindergarten app showing a photo of Zahra doing a painting activity (Aisha smiles at the screen), and an email about a food delivery order for tomorrow. She takes the last sip of shaah, the cup tilting to catch the sweet remnants. The plate is empty. The clock on the wall reads 1:55. She needs to pick up Zahra soon.

A separate cutting board (color-coded red for raw meat) sits on the steel table. She wears disposable gloves. The meat is halal -- from the local halal butcher.

She adds cumin, coriander, a pinch of sugar, salt, and a bay leaf. She stirs the sauce, which begins to bubble. The pot is large enough for a full dinner service batch.

**Time:** 2:55 PM -- gray winter afternoon
**Setting:** Inside the minivan, driving

She passes through the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood -- small shops, a Somali grocery store, a mosque, apartment buildings. She turns onto a residential street toward Zahra's elementary school. The car is quiet without the children. She listens to a Somali radio station -- a woman's voice speaking in Somali with occasional music. The school zone sign appears ahead. She slows down.

### Scene 135: Waiting in the School Pick-Up Line
**Time:** 3:05 PM -- gray winter afternoon
**Setting:** Elementary school pick-up lane, inside minivan
**Description:** Aisha waits in the school pick-up line, the minivan idling. A line of cars stretches ahead of her -- other parents waiting.

She replies with a thumbs-up emoji. She adjusts her teal hijab in the rearview mirror. The car heater runs. Other parents' cars idle, exhaust forming white clouds in the cold. A crossing guard in an orange vest stands at the crosswalk.

### Scene 136: Zahra Comes Running
**Time:** 3:15 PM -- gray winter afternoon, school lights
**Setting:** Elementary school entrance
**Description:** The school doors open and children pour out in a stream of colorful winter coats and backpacks. Aisha has gotten out of the minivan and stands beside it, scanning the crowd. Zahra appears -- lavender coat, purple boots, pom-pom hat, pink backpack bouncing. She spots Aisha and runs toward her, arms wide, a huge gap-toothed grin on her small round face. She crashes into Aisha's legs in a hug. Aisha bends down and scoops her up, kissing her cold cheek. Zahra chatters immediately about her day. Her mittened hand holds a crumpled piece of artwork.

### Scene 137: Zahra Shows Her Artwork
**Time:** 3:17 PM -- inside the minivan
**Setting:** Honda Odyssey, parked
**Description:** Aisha buckles Zahra into the booster seat and Zahra immediately thrusts the piece of artwork toward her -- a finger-painting on white paper showing colorful blobs that Zahra explains is "our family and Basra." Aisha holds the painting carefully, studying it: five stick figures of varying sizes and an orange blob (the cat). She praises it enthusiastically, her warm brown eyes crinkling with genuine delight. She props the painting on the passenger seat so it does not get crumpled. Zahra's pink backpack sits beside her. The stuffed bunny from morning is waiting in the back seat.

### Scene 138: Quick Stop at the Somali Grocery
**Time:** 3:25 PM -- gray afternoon, grocery store
**Setting:** Inside a Somali grocery store
**Description:** Aisha stops at a Somali grocery store in Cedar-Riverside, a small shop with narrow aisles. She holds Zahra's hand as they walk through.

Aisha picks up a box of cardamom tea, a bag of dried pasta, and a container of ghee. Zahra reaches for a box of juice on a low shelf. Aisha nods -- she can have one.

### Scene 139: Loading Groceries in the Minivan
**Time:** 3:32 PM -- gray afternoon, parking lot
**Setting:** Grocery store parking lot
**Description:** Aisha loads two plastic bags of groceries into the back of the silver minivan. The parking lot is small, sandwiched between buildings. A light snow has begun to fall -- tiny flakes drifting in the cold air and landing on the minivan's roof and Aisha's black coat. Zahra sits in her booster seat inside, drinking the juice box through a straw, watching the snowflakes through the window. Aisha closes the back hatch, brushes a few snowflakes off her teal hijab, and walks to the driver's door. Her boots crunch on a thin layer of new snow. The parking lot lights are starting to come on.

### Scene 140: Returning to the Restaurant
**Time:** 3:45 PM -- gray winter afternoon, light snow
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen back parking area
**Description:** Aisha pulls the minivan into the parking spot behind Hoyo's Kitchen. Light snow dusts the pavement. She unbuckles Zahra and carries her on one hip, the grocery bags in the other hand, to the back door. She pushes the door open with her shoulder. The warm kitchen air hits them -- the aroma of simmering pasta sauce. Fatima greets Zahra with a wide smile. Zahra waves. Aisha sets her down and hangs up her coat. She puts the grocery bags on the prep table to unpack. Zahra stands in the kitchen doorway, looking around with big curious eyes.

### Scene 141: Setting Up Zahra in the Break Room
**Time:** 3:48 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room behind kitchen
**Description:** Aisha sets Zahra up in the break room with a coloring book, a box of crayons, and a snack -- apple slices and a few pieces of canjeero with honey. Zahra sits at the small table, her lavender coat hung on a low hook, her pink backpack on the floor. The stuffed bunny sits on the table beside the coloring book. Zahra picks a green crayon and begins coloring a picture of a fish. Aisha places a sippy cup of water beside the snack. She kisses the top of Zahra's pom-pom hat (still on) and tells her she will be just through the door in the kitchen.

### Scene 142: Back to Dinner Prep
**Time:** 3:55 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha ties her apron back on and returns to the kitchen. She checks the pasta sauce -- it has thickened nicely, the tomato base dark red and rich. She stirs it with a long wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot. She tastes it from the spoon, adds a pinch more salt, stirs again. Omar has finished marinating the lamb. Fatima has prepped three containers of fresh salad. The bariis pot is on the stove, rice soaking. Aisha checks the clock -- dinner service starts at 4:30. She begins heating oil in a large pot for boiling pasta. The kitchen shifts back into high gear.

### Scene 143: Boiling Pasta
**Time:** 4:00 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** A large pot of water boils on the commercial stove, steam billowing upward into the exhaust hood. Aisha pours dried spaghetti noodles from a package into the boiling water. The noodles stand stiff for a moment, then soften and slide into the water. She adds a splash of oil and a pinch of salt. She stirs the noodles with a long fork to separate them. The bubbling water foams slightly. The timer is set for 10 minutes. On the next burner, the pasta sauce simmers. On another, the bariis cooks with its cinnamon and cardamom. The kitchen is a symphony of pots.

### Scene 144: Grilling Lamb
**Time:** 4:10 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light, stove flame
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Omar grills marinated lamb pieces on a large flat grill pan on the commercial stove. The lamb sizzles and smokes as it hits the hot surface -- the marinade (cumin, garlic, lemon, oil) caramelizes. He flips the pieces with tongs. Aisha stands beside him, seasoning a separate batch of chicken in a bowl. The grill pan sends up aromatic smoke that the exhaust hood captures. The lamb pieces are turning dark golden with charred edges. A tray lined with foil waits to receive the cooked lamb. The meat section of the refrigerator door is open, a halal sticker visible.

### Scene 145: Draining Pasta
**Time:** 4:12 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light, steam
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** The timer beeps. Aisha carries the heavy pot of cooked spaghetti to the sink and pours it into a large colander. A massive cloud of steam rises as the boiling water drains through. The spaghetti sits in the colander, pale yellow and cooked through. Aisha shakes the colander to drain excess water. She drizzles a small amount of oil over the noodles and tosses them with tongs to prevent sticking. The empty pot goes back on the stove. She will add the spaghetti to the tomato sauce just before serving. The noodles glisten under the fluorescent light.

### Scene 146: Mixing Pasta with Sauce
**Time:** 4:18 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha transfers the drained spaghetti into the large pot of simmering tomato sauce. She uses tongs to toss the noodles, coating every strand with the thick, spiced red sauce. The pasta turns from pale yellow to deep tomato-red as the sauce clings. She adds a handful of diced onion and cilantro to the top. She stirs one more time, the tongs twisting through the sauced noodles. The pot is large and heavy. Steam carries the aroma of cumin-spiced tomato, garlic, and pasta. This is Somali-style pasta -- a beloved fusion dish. She covers the pot and lowers the flame.

### Scene 147: Checking on Zahra
**Time:** 4:22 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room
**Description:** Aisha pops her head into the break room to check on Zahra. The little girl is still at the table, coloring intently. The coloring book page now shows a green fish with purple spots -- Zahra's creative interpretation. The apple slices are eaten, a few canjeero crumbs remain on the plate. The sippy cup is half empty. The stuffed bunny has been positioned to "watch" the coloring. Zahra looks up and shows Aisha the page. Aisha smiles and says it is beautiful. She asks if Zahra needs anything. Zahra shakes her head and goes back to coloring. The crayons are scattered across the table.

### Scene 148: Dinner Service Begins
**Time:** 4:30 PM -- dining room lights, early evening
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, front entrance
**Description:** The first dinner customers arrive. A group of three young men in winter coats enter, talking and laughing. They are students from the nearby university, regulars who come for the affordable, filling food. Aisha greets them from behind the counter, her teal hijab fresh (she adjusted it), apron clean (she put on a new one for dinner). They take their usual table near the window. The OPEN sign glows red. Outside, the Minneapolis sky is darkening to deep blue -- winter sunsets come early. The streetlights are on. Inside, the restaurant is warm and inviting, the orange walls glowing.

### Scene 149: Dinner Orders Coming In
**Time:** 4:40 PM -- dining room and kitchen
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at order wire
**Description:** Aisha clips dinner order tickets to the wire above the service window. The students ordered: two Somali pasta plates and one bariis with lamb. Omar reads the tickets and begins plating. He spoons Somali pasta -- spaghetti in the red spiced sauce -- onto plates, twisting it with tongs for height. He places grilled lamb pieces beside a mound of bariis on the third plate. Aisha adds salad and canjeero to each. Through the service window, more customers are settling into the dining room. The kitchen moves into dinner rhythm. Fatima fries a fresh batch of sambusas, the oil crackling.

### Scene 150: Serving Dinner Plates
**Time:** 4:45 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, at table
**Description:** Aisha carries plates to the students' table on a tray. She sets down the two Somali pasta plates -- the spaghetti is a deep red mound, steaming, with a piece of canjeero and a lemon wedge on the side. The bariis with lamb plate shows fluffy white rice beside dark golden grilled lamb pieces, salad, and canjeero. The students lean forward, inhaling the aromas. One says something appreciative. Aisha sets down forks and napkins. She asks about drinks -- they want mango juice and water. She heads back to fill the glasses.

## PART 6: DINNER SERVICE CONTINUES AND CLOSING (5:00 PM - 8:30 PM)

### Scene 151: Dinner Rush
**Time:** 5:30 PM -- dining room, full
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, wide view
**Description:** The dinner rush is in full swing. Six of eight tables are occupied. The dining room buzzes with conversation in English and Somali. Aisha moves between tables -- taking orders, delivering plates, clearing dishes. She carries a bus tub of dirty dishes on one hip, weaving around chairs. Through the service window, the kitchen glows with activity. The orange walls are warm. The framed Somali landscape photos catch the light. The menu board is illuminated. The front windows show a dark Minneapolis evening -- streetlights, headlights, and gently falling snow. The OPEN sign is bright red.

### Scene 152: Abdi Calls
**Time:** 5:45 PM -- near the counter
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, near cash register
**Description:** Aisha's phone buzzes in her apron pocket. She steps to the side near the cash register and answers -- it is Abdi, her husband. He is between ride-share fares and checking in. She speaks quickly in Somali, one hand holding the phone, the other wiping the counter with a cloth. She asks him to make sure Hamza and Amina have started their homework. He says he will check when he gets home. She tells him she will bring food home. They exchange a brief, warm goodbye. She tucks the phone back in her apron. A customer approaches the register to pay.

### Scene 153: Ringing Up a Customer
**Time:** 5:48 PM -- counter
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, cash register area
**Description:** Aisha stands behind the counter at the cash register as a customer pays. She rings up the total -- two suqaar plates, one sambusa appetizer, two shaah, one mango juice -- pressing the register buttons. The register displays the total. The customer holds a credit card. Aisha swipes it through the card reader, waits for approval, and hands the receipt for signing. A tip jar sits on the counter beside the stack of takeout menus. The customer signs, adds a tip, and thanks Aisha. She thanks him warmly. Through the service window behind her, Omar plates another order.

### Scene 154: Packing Food for Home
**Time:** 6:00 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha packs containers of food for her family's dinner at home. She fills a large container with Somali pasta -- spaghetti in the spiced tomato sauce. A second container gets bariis and suqaar -- rice and stir-fried chicken. She adds a container of salad and a few sambusas wrapped in foil. She stacks them in a large plastic bag. This is one advantage of owning a restaurant -- good food goes home with the family. She labels the bag "HOME" in marker. She sets it on the shelf near the back door, ready for when she leaves. The kitchen continues its dinner service around her.

### Scene 155: Maghrib Prayer
**Time:** 6:15 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room
**Description:** Aisha steps into the break room for Maghrib (sunset) prayer. The small window shows complete darkness outside -- sunset was hours ago in the Minneapolis winter. She performs quick wudu at the sink and lays out the travel prayer rug. Zahra sits on a chair in the corner, watching her mother pray. The little girl is quiet and respectful, her coloring book closed. Aisha stands on the rug, hands raised, and begins. Her teal hijab and cream tunic are visible beneath the untied apron draped over a chair. The clock reads 6:15. The muffled sounds of the kitchen are audible through the door.

### Scene 156: Zahra Watches Prayer
**Time:** 6:18 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room, Zahra's perspective
**Description:** Zahra watches her mother from the chair, her small legs dangling above the floor. Aisha is in sujud -- prostration -- on the travel prayer rug, forehead touching the ground. Zahra hugs the stuffed bunny and watches with wide, curious brown eyes. She is learning by watching -- this is how the practice is passed down. The coloring book and scattered crayons sit on the table beside the half-empty sippy cup. Zahra's lavender coat is on the hook. The break room is quiet except for Aisha's soft murmured prayers. The moment is intimate and peaceful.

### Scene 157: Late Dinner Customers
**Time:** 6:45 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room
**Description:** A couple enters the restaurant -- a Somali woman in a beautiful gold hijab and a man in a casual button-down shirt. They are on a dinner outing, speaking Somali softly. Aisha welcomes them and shows them to a table with a view of the menu board. The dining room has thinned slightly from the peak but still has four tables occupied. Aisha brings menus and water. The woman asks about the lamb bariis -- is it especially good today? Aisha nods enthusiastically -- the lamb is tender and well-spiced. They order it along with sambusas and shaah. The OPEN sign reflects in the dark window.

### Scene 158: Last Big Batch of Sambusas
**Time:** 7:00 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at deep fryer
**Description:** Fatima fries the last big batch of sambusas for the evening. The golden triangles bob in the hot oil, bubbling and crisping. She lifts them out with the slotted spoon -- perfectly browned, glistening with oil -- and sets them on paper-towel-lined trays. These are for the remaining dinner orders and any late customers. Aisha counts them -- eighteen sambusas. She arranges twelve on a serving tray for the dining room and sets six aside for the takeout orders that will come in before closing. The fryer oil bubbles and settles. The kitchen is warm and heavy with cooking smells.

### Scene 159: Takeout Phone Orders
**Time:** 7:15 PM -- at desk
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, order desk near service window
**Description:** The phone rings again. Aisha answers, pen ready. A customer calls in a takeout order: a large tray of bariis with hilib, six sambusas, and a container of Somali pasta. Pickup in thirty minutes. Aisha writes it all down on the order pad, tears off the ticket, and clips it to the wire. She calls the order to Omar, who nods from the stove. This is the third takeout order of the evening. A stack of styrofoam containers and paper bags are ready. Aisha writes the customer name and pickup time on the ticket. The clock reads 7:15.

### Scene 160: Dinner Winding Down
**Time:** 7:30 PM -- dining room, fewer customers
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room
**Description:** The dinner service is winding down. Two tables remain occupied, customers finishing their meals slowly. Aisha begins pre-closing tasks in the dining room: she wipes cleared tables, refills napkin holders, and straightens chairs. Through the front window, the Minneapolis night is dark and cold, snow falling gently under the streetlights. The couple from earlier is lingering over shaah, talking softly. Aisha brings them a small complimentary plate of dates -- a Somali hospitality touch. The gold-hijab woman thanks her warmly. Aisha begins flipping empty table chairs upside down.

### Scene 161: Turning Off the OPEN Sign
**Time:** 8:00 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen front entrance
**Description:** Aisha walks to the front door and flips the switch on the OPEN sign. The red neon dims and goes dark. She locks the front door from the inside, turning the deadbolt. Through the glass door, the snowy Minneapolis street is quiet -- a few cars pass, their headlights cutting through the falling snow. The restaurant hours sticker on the door reads "Mon-Sat 11am-9pm" but they close the kitchen at 8:00 most nights. She pulls the window shade partway down. The dining room behind her is nearly empty -- the last customer left moments ago. Chairs are inverted on most tables.

### Scene 162: Cleaning the Kitchen -- End of Day
**Time:** 8:05 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, kitchen wide view
**Description:** The end-of-day kitchen clean begins. Omar scrubs the large pots and pans, water splashing. Fatima mops the floor between the prep tables, the mop swishing through soapy water. Aisha wipes down the stove top, the grill, and the prep table surfaces with sanitizer. She empties the grease trap from the deep fryer into a container. She organizes the walk-in refrigerator -- covering containers, checking dates, stacking neatly. The kitchen goes from a working mess to clean and orderly, surface by surface. The team works without talking much -- they know the routine. The radio on the shelf plays Somali music softly.

### Scene 163: Sweeping the Dining Room
**Time:** 8:15 PM -- dining room lights
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room
**Description:** Aisha sweeps the dining room floor with a large push broom. She sweeps between the table legs and under the chairs that are still down, collecting crumbs, a straw wrapper, a napkin that fell. The broom makes long swishing sounds on the tile floor. The dining room is empty and quiet -- chairs inverted on most tables, the menu board lit, the Somali landscape photos watching over the empty room. She sweeps everything into a dustpan and dumps it into the trash. The orange walls look warm even in the empty room. Through the front window, snow continues to fall.

### Scene 164: Saying Goodnight to Staff
**Time:** 8:25 PM -- back door area
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, back entrance
**Description:** Omar and Fatima pull on their winter coats, scarves, and gloves. They say goodnight to Aisha at the back door. Fatima hugs Aisha -- they are close, like younger sister and older sister. Omar gives a respectful nod and a wave. Aisha thanks them for a good day and reminds them of tomorrow's schedule. They push through the back door into the cold night -- the parking area is covered in fresh snow. Their cars start with cold-engine rumbles. Aisha watches from the doorway, the warm kitchen air mixing with the freezing outside air. She waves as they drive off. Then she closes the door.

### Scene 165: Gathering Zahra and Bags
**Time:** 8:28 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room
**Description:** Aisha enters the break room where Zahra is curled up on a chair, half-asleep, the stuffed bunny tucked under her chin. The coloring book is closed, crayons scattered. Aisha gently rouses her, zipping up her lavender coat and pulling on the pom-pom hat. She slips the pink backpack over Zahra's small shoulders. She grabs the bag of food for home from the kitchen shelf, her purse, and the grocery bags from earlier. Arms full, she holds Zahra's hand. They head to the back door. Aisha flips off the kitchen lights -- the fluorescent tubes blink and go dark. She locks the back door behind them.

### Scene 166: Loading the Minivan at Night
**Time:** 8:32 PM -- dark, snowy parking area
**Setting:** Behind Hoyo's Kitchen, night
**Description:** Aisha loads bags into the back of the silver minivan in the dark, snowy parking area. The overhead security light casts a yellowish glow on the fresh snow. Flakes are still falling gently. Her breath makes white clouds. She sets the food bag, grocery bag, and purse in the back. She lifts Zahra into the booster seat -- the little girl is limp with sleepiness, eyes barely open. Aisha buckles her in, adjusting the strap over the lavender coat. She brushes snow off the minivan's windshield with her gloved hand. The restaurant behind them is dark now, closed until tomorrow.

### Scene 167: Driving Home at Night
**Time:** 8:40 PM -- dark streets, headlights, falling snow
**Setting:** Inside the minivan, driving
**Description:** Aisha drives through snowy Minneapolis streets toward home. The headlights illuminate falling snowflakes that rush toward the windshield. The wipers swish back and forth. The road is quiet -- few cars at this hour on residential streets. The heater runs. Zahra is asleep in the booster seat, the pom-pom hat lopsided, bunny in her lap. Aisha drives carefully, both hands on the wheel. The dashboard clock reads 8:40. Street lights make golden pools on the white snow. She passes the familiar landmarks -- the mosque, the Somali mall, the intersection at Cedar Avenue. Almost home.

### Scene 168: Arriving Home
**Time:** 8:50 PM -- townhouse front, night
**Setting:** Townhouse exterior/driveway, night
**Description:** Aisha pulls the minivan onto the street in front of the townhouse. The porch light is on -- Abdi turned it on for her. The townhouse windows glow warmly. Fresh snow covers the small front yard and sidewalk. She parks, turns off the engine, and sits for just a moment in the quiet. Then she gets out, opens the back door, and unbuckles sleeping Zahra. She lifts the little girl, who stirs but does not wake, and settles her on her hip. She grabs the food bag with her free hand. The cold night air bites at her face. She walks carefully up the snowy front steps to the porch.

### Scene 169: Abdi Opens the Door
**Time:** 8:52 PM -- warm interior light
**Setting:** Townhouse front door, interior
**Description:** The front door opens and Abdi stands there -- a tall Somali American man of 43 with medium brown skin, short beard, wearing a gray sweatshirt and dark pants. He takes the food bag from Aisha's hand and holds the door wide. Warm air rushes out. Aisha carries sleeping Zahra inside, stamping snow from her boots on the doormat. The front hallway is warm and lit. Shoes are lined up on the shoe rack. Coats hang on hooks. Basra the orange cat sits at the top of the stairs, watching the arrival with wide amber eyes. Abdi kisses Aisha's forehead and takes Zahra from her arms.

### Scene 170: Abdi Carries Zahra Upstairs
**Time:** 8:54 PM -- stairway light
**Setting:** Townhouse stairway
**Description:** Abdi carries sleeping Zahra up the stairs, her small head resting on his broad shoulder. The pom-pom hat has fallen off, her two puffs are loosened. The stuffed bunny dangles from her hand. He walks carefully, holding the banister with one hand. Aisha watches from the bottom of the stairs, removing her winter coat and scarf. Basra the cat follows Abdi up the stairs, orange tail held high. The family photos on the stairway wall pass by -- the wedding photo, the baby pictures, the school portraits. Abdi disappears into Zahra's bedroom. Aisha can hear his soft voice talking to the sleepy child.

### Scene 171: Removing the Hijab at Home
**Time:** 8:56 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at dresser
**Description:** Aisha enters her bedroom and removes the teal hijab, unpinning it carefully and folding it into a neat square. She sets it on the dresser with the other hijabs. She pulls off the black under-cap, and her dark hair, slightly flattened from the day, falls in the bun. She shakes her head slightly and loosens the bun, running her fingers through her hair. She looks at herself in the dresser mirror -- tired, but her warm brown eyes still hold a spark. The prayer rug is folded by the bed. The Quran is on the nightstand. Basra has already claimed his spot on the bed, purring.

### Scene 172: Changing into Home Clothes
**Time:** 8:59 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom
**Description:** Aisha changes out of her restaurant work clothes. She removes the cream tunic, the dark pants, and the closed-toe shoes. She puts on comfortable evening clothes -- soft loose pants and a long-sleeved cotton top in dark green. Her feet go into the brown house slippers. She folds the work clothes and sets them in a hamper near the closet. The day's outfit has a turmeric stain on the sleeve and a faint scent of cooking spices. She is comfortable now, in her own home, hair loose in the bun, no hijab. She pads downstairs in her slippers to join the family.

### Scene 173: Kitchen -- Setting Out Family Dinner
**Time:** 9:05 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Aisha unpacks the restaurant food onto the kitchen table. She transfers the Somali pasta from the container to a serving bowl -- the red-sauced spaghetti steams. The bariis and suqaar go into another bowl. The salad into a smaller bowl. Sambusas are arranged on a plate. She sets out plates, forks, napkins, and glasses. Abdi comes downstairs -- he has changed Zahra into pajamas and put her to bed. He helps set out the food. The kitchen is warm. Through the window, snow falls in the dark backyard. Basra sits on the kitchen floor, ears perked at the food smells.

### Scene 174: Hamza and Amina Come Down
**Time:** 9:08 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Family kitchen, table area
**Description:** Hamza and Amina come down the stairs, drawn by the smell of food. Hamza is in sweatpants and a hoodie, phone in hand as always. Amina wears pajamas already -- plaid pajama pants and a long-sleeved top. They sit at the table. Hamza reaches for a sambusa immediately. Aisha says bismillah (in the name of God) and the family begins eating. Amina twirls Somali pasta on her fork. Abdi spoons bariis and suqaar onto his plate. The kitchen table is full of food and family. Basra weaves between chair legs under the table. The overhead light is warm. Snow falls outside the dark window.

### Scene 175: Family Dinner Conversation
**Time:** 9:12 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** The family eats and talks. Amina describes a science project at school -- building a model of the solar system. She asks if she can buy foam balls at the craft store. Aisha nods while eating a sambusa. Hamza talks about basketball practice -- he made three free throws in a row. Abdi listens, chewing bariis, and nods approvingly. The conversation flows between English and Somali. Aisha adds comments between bites of pasta, her round face warm and content. The food containers are half-empty. Basra has curled up under Zahra's empty chair. The kitchen clock reads 9:12.

### Scene 176: Aisha and Abdi Talk
**Time:** 9:18 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** The children have left the table, taking their plates to the sink. Aisha and Abdi sit together over the remains of dinner. Aisha tells Abdi about the catering orders -- the Friday order for 30 sambusas, the business is growing. Abdi tells her about his day driving ride-share -- a good day, many fares, but the roads were slippery. He pours shaah from the thermal pot she brought home into two cups. They drink the spiced tea together in the quiet kitchen. Basra jumps onto Aisha's lap and she strokes his orange fur absently. The moment is companionable and calm.

### Scene 177: Clearing the Table
**Time:** 9:25 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table and sink
**Description:** Aisha clears the dinner table, stacking plates and gathering utensils. She scrapes remaining food into a container for tomorrow's lunch at the restaurant. The serving bowls go to the sink. Abdi washes dishes at the sink -- soapy water, scrubbing plates, rinsing under hot water. They work together without talking much, a practiced division of labor. Aisha wipes the table with a damp cloth, picks up crumbs, and straightens the chairs. The kitchen returns to order. The thermal pot is empty. The honey jar goes back in the cabinet. Basra watches from the doorway.

### Scene 178: Checking Amina's Homework
**Time:** 9:30 PM -- living room
**Setting:** Townhouse living room, on sofa
**Description:** Aisha sits on the living room sofa beside Amina, reviewing her homework. The living room has a comfortable brown sectional sofa, a coffee table, a TV on a stand, and bookshelves. Amina's math notebook is open on the coffee table. Aisha looks at the problems -- multiplication of fractions. She points to one answer and raises an eyebrow. Amina groans and picks up her pencil to redo it. Aisha watches patiently, helping when asked. The TV is off. A floor lamp casts a warm glow. Amina's braids fall forward as she bends over the notebook. Basra is on the sofa between them, purring.

### Scene 179: Talking to Hamza About School
**Time:** 9:40 PM -- upstairs hallway
**Setting:** Outside Hamza's bedroom door
**Description:** Aisha knocks on Hamza's door and opens it slightly. Hamza is at his desk, laptop open, headphones around his neck. His room is a typical teen space -- basketball posters, clothes on the floor, a desk lamp on. Aisha leans in the doorway and asks about his homework. He says it is done -- mostly. She asks about a history paper that is due Friday. He says he will finish it tomorrow. Aisha gives him a look that says she knows he is procrastinating. She reminds him and he nods. She tells him lights out by 10:30. He agrees with a sigh that is half-affectionate.

### Scene 180: Checking on Zahra
**Time:** 9:45 PM -- Zahra's bedroom, nightlight
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha quietly opens Zahra's bedroom door and peeks in. The room is dark except for the pink nightlight near the floor, which casts a soft glow. Zahra is asleep in the small bed, curled on her side under the purple star comforter, the stuffed bunny tucked under her chin. Her two puffs are loosened and her curly hair fans on the pillow. Her small round face is peaceful. Aisha tiptoes in and pulls the comforter up slightly, tucking it around Zahra's shoulders. She brushes a curl from Zahra's forehead. She stands for a moment, watching her youngest child sleep. Then she slips out, pulling the door almost closed.

### Scene 181: Isha Prayer
**Time:** 9:50 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at prayer rug
**Description:** Aisha performs the Isha (night) prayer in her bedroom. The overhead light is off; the bedside lamp provides warm, soft illumination. She stands on the green and gold prayer rug, hands raised, beginning the prayer. She wears the dark green cotton top and soft pants, a lightweight prayer garment over her head and shoulders. Her movements are slower than the morning prayer -- the day's tiredness is in her limbs. But the practice is steady and familiar. Basra watches from the bed. The Quran sits on the nightstand. The alarm clock reads 9:50. The house is quiet.

### Scene 182: Completing Isha Prayer
**Time:** 9:58 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at prayer rug
**Description:** Aisha sits in the final position of the Isha prayer, turning her head right and left for the final salaam. She stays seated on the prayer rug for a moment, hands on her knees, eyes closed, making a quiet personal supplication -- for her family, her business, her health. The lamplight catches the gold threads in the prayer rug's geometric pattern. Then she opens her eyes, takes a deep breath, and folds the prayer rug carefully, placing it in its spot by the bed. She removes the prayer garment and drapes it over the bedpost. The last prayer of the day is complete.

### Scene 183: Hot Tea on the Sofa
**Time:** 10:00 PM -- living room, lamp light
**Setting:** Townhouse living room
**Description:** Aisha sits on the living room sofa with a fresh cup of shaah, cradled in both hands. Abdi sits beside her, his own cup on the coffee table, watching the news on TV with the volume low. The living room is dim -- the floor lamp and the TV glow are the only lights. Aisha sips the tea slowly, savoring the cardamom and cinnamon. Her dark hair is loose in the bun, no hijab. Her slippered feet are tucked under her on the sofa. Basra is curled on the armrest beside her, orange tail draped over the edge. The moment is quiet and domestic. She leans her head back and closes her eyes briefly.

### Scene 184: Calling Her Mother in Somalia
**Time:** 10:10 PM -- living room
**Setting:** Townhouse living room, on sofa
**Description:** Aisha picks up her phone and makes a video call. On the screen, her elderly mother appears -- a Somali woman with a weathered, kind face and a white headscarf, sitting in a bright room in Mogadishu. They speak in Somali, animatedly. Aisha's face lights up -- her widest smile of the day. She shows her mother the living room (panning the phone), tells her about the restaurant. Her mother laughs and asks about the grandchildren. Aisha promises to send photos. Abdi leans in and waves at the screen. The distance between Minneapolis and Mogadishu shrinks to the size of the phone screen. Aisha's eyes are bright with emotion.

### Scene 185: Applying Face Cream -- Night Routine
**Time:** 10:20 PM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Master bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Aisha stands at the bathroom sink for her nighttime routine. She washes her face with warm water and a mild cleanser, patting the foam over her round face and rinsing. She pats dry with a towel. Then she opens the jar of face cream and applies it in gentle circles -- forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, neck. The cream is a light moisturizer. She looks at herself in the mirror -- her warm brown eyes are tired but content. The day has been long. Her dark hair is loose around her face. The bright bathroom light is harsh; she will turn it off soon and welcome the softness of lamplight.

### Scene 186: Brushing Teeth Before Bed
**Time:** 10:23 PM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Master bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Aisha brushes her teeth with the blue toothbrush, the white foam of toothpaste at the corners of her mouth. She brushes steadily, watching herself in the mirror with half-closed eyes. Tiredness is settling into her body. She rinses, spits, and rinses again. She returns the toothbrush to the holder -- four toothbrushes in a row: blue (hers), green (Abdi's), red (Hamza's), orange (Amina's). Zahra's small purple toothbrush is in the children's bathroom upstairs. She rinses the sink clean, turns off the faucet, and flips off the bright light. The hallway is dark and quiet.

### Scene 187: Abdi Checks the Doors
**Time:** 10:25 PM -- downstairs, dim light
**Setting:** Townhouse ground floor
**Description:** Abdi moves through the ground floor checking the locks. He turns the deadbolt on the front door, checks the back door is locked, and makes sure the stove is off. The kitchen is dark except for the small light above the stove. He turns off the living room TV and the floor lamp. The ground floor goes dark. Through the kitchen window, the snowy backyard is faintly visible under the neighbor's security light. Basra follows Abdi, orange tail up, then trots up the stairs ahead of him. The house is being put to bed, one light switch at a time.

### Scene 188: Getting Into Bed
**Time:** 10:28 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha pulls back the burgundy comforter and slips into bed. She wears her white cotton nightgown, her dark hair in a loose bun for the night. The sheets are cool against her skin. She settles in, pulling the comforter up to her shoulders, arranging the pillows. The bedside lamp is still on. The alarm clock reads 10:28. The prayer rug is folded by the bed. The Quran is on the nightstand. Basra jumps onto the bed and circles twice before settling at her feet, his warm weight familiar and comforting. Abdi enters the bedroom and begins his own bedtime routine.

### Scene 189: Setting the Alarm
**Time:** 10:30 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, nightstand close-up
**Description:** Aisha reaches for the digital alarm clock on the nightstand and sets it for 5:30 AM -- another early morning tomorrow. The green numbers glow as she presses the buttons. She sets her phone beside the clock and plugs in the charger -- the screen briefly lights up showing a photo of her three children as the wallpaper. She places her reading glasses on top of the Quran. The nightstand is arranged: clock, phone, glasses, Quran, glass of water, and the lamp. Everything in its place. She takes a sip of water and sets the glass down.

### Scene 190: Reading Before Sleep
**Time:** 10:32 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Aisha picks up a Somali novel from the nightstand -- a thin paperback with a colorful cover showing Somali writing. She puts on her reading glasses and opens to the bookmarked page. She reads quietly, the lamplight falling on the pages. The novel is in Somali script. Her brown eyes move across the lines. The comforter is pulled to her chest. Basra is curled at her feet, a warm orange ball. The house is quiet -- only the soft hum of the heating system. Through the window, snowflakes drift past in the dark. She reads one page, then another, her eyelids growing heavy.

### Scene 191: Abdi Turns Off His Light
**Time:** 10:40 PM -- bedroom, dimmer
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, Abdi's side
**Description:** Abdi, on his side of the bed, sets down his phone and turns off the lamp on his nightstand. His side goes dark. He settles under the comforter, facing Aisha. He murmurs goodnight. Aisha murmurs back without looking up from her book, a small smile on her face. The bedroom is now half-dark -- only Aisha's bedside lamp remains. The window shows the dark winter night with snowflakes. The prayer rug is a dark rectangle on the floor. Basra shifts at the foot of the bed, readjusting. The comforter rustles as Abdi settles.

### Scene 192: Putting Down the Book
**Time:** 10:48 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, nightstand
**Description:** Aisha's eyes are heavy. She reads the same sentence twice without absorbing it. She places the bookmark -- a strip of fabric, possibly cut from an old hijab -- between the pages and closes the Somali novel. She sets it on the nightstand beside the Quran. She removes her reading glasses and folds them on top of the book. She takes one last sip of water. The clock reads 10:48. She takes a deep breath and exhales slowly -- the kind of breath that lets go of the whole day. The kitchen, the orders, the school runs, the cooking, the cleaning. All done.

### Scene 193: Turning Off the Lamp
**Time:** 10:50 PM -- bedroom, last light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at lamp
**Description:** Aisha reaches over and clicks off the bedside lamp. The bedroom goes dark. The only light is the faint green glow of the alarm clock showing 10:50 and the dim suggestion of the snowy night through the window. She settles into her pillow, pulling the comforter close. Basra's warm weight is at her feet. Abdi breathes steadily beside her. The house is quiet -- three children sleeping in their rooms, the cat at her feet, the snow falling silently outside on Minneapolis. Another full day is done. Tomorrow she will wake at 5:30, pray, cook, care, drive, cook again. But now, she sleeps.

### Scene 194: Cat Adjusts
**Time:** 10:55 PM -- dark, faint clock glow
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at foot of bed
**Description:** In the dark bedroom, the orange tabby cat Basra shifts at the foot of the bed. He stands, stretches long -- front legs out, back arched -- and pads up along the comforter until he settles in the warm space between Aisha and Abdi. He turns in a circle three times and lies down, tucking his nose under his orange tail. A soft purring vibrates through the comforter. Aisha reaches out in the dark and rests one hand on his warm fur. The purring intensifies. The alarm clock glows 10:55. Snowflakes tick faintly against the window. Silence. Sleep.

## PART 8: SUPPLEMENTAL SCENES -- ADDITIONAL RESTAURANT DETAILS (Various Times)

### Scene 195: Morning Spice Prep -- Grinding Cumin
**Time:** 9:00 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at prep table
**Description:** Aisha grinds whole cumin seeds in a small spice grinder on the prep table. The grinder whirs and vibrates in her hand. She lifts the lid and checks the texture -- fine, earthy brown powder. The aroma of fresh-ground cumin is intense and warm. She taps the ground cumin into a labeled jar and screws the lid on. The whole cumin seeds came from a large bag on the shelf. Other whole spices wait their turn -- coriander seeds, dried cloves, cardamom pods. Fresh-ground spices have a stronger flavor than pre-ground. Aisha knows this makes a difference in the food.

### Scene 196: Receiving a Delivery
**Time:** 8:45 AM -- back door area
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, back entrance
**Description:** A delivery truck has pulled up behind the restaurant. A delivery driver stands at the open back door with a clipboard and a hand truck stacked with boxes. Aisha checks the clipboard, reading the items: cases of canned tomatoes, bags of basmati rice (50 lb), cartons of cooking oil, and a box of halal chicken from the supplier. She signs the clipboard with a pen. The driver wheels the boxes into the kitchen, stacking them near the storage area. Cold air rushes in through the open door. Aisha checks each box against the order form, counting and inspecting. Everything matches.

### Scene 197: Stocking the Walk-In
**Time:** 9:00 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light, cold refrigerator
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, walk-in refrigerator
**Description:** Aisha carries the box of halal chicken into the walk-in refrigerator. The heavy door props open behind her. Her breath is visible in the cold air. She sets the box on a metal shelf and opens it -- individually wrapped portions of chicken breast and thighs, each package stamped with the halal certification symbol. She organizes them on the shelf, oldest stock in front (first in, first out). She checks the thermometer on the wall -- 38 degrees Fahrenheit, safe. The shelves hold containers of prepped vegetables, marinating meats, dairy, and produce. She steps out and lets the heavy door swing shut.

### Scene 198: Making Canjeero for the Restaurant
**Time:** 9:30 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light, at stove
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at commercial stove
**Description:** Aisha makes canjeero on the flat commercial griddle for the restaurant. She pours batter from a large pitcher in the signature spiral pattern -- from outside to center. The batter is thin, like a crepe. It sizzles and cooks quickly, bubbles forming a lacy pattern. She lifts the edge with a spatula, checking the golden-brown underside. She folds the canjeero in quarters and places it on a warming tray. She pours the next one immediately. A stack of fresh canjeero grows on the tray -- each one golden, round, and lacy. The restaurant goes through two dozen canjeero on a busy day.

### Scene 199: Writing the Daily Specials Board
**Time:** 10:30 AM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, at chalk board
**Description:** Aisha stands before a small chalkboard near the entrance and writes the daily specials with colored chalk. In neat handwriting she writes: "Today's Special: Lamb Suqaar with Bariis -- $12.99" and "Somali Pasta (Baasto) with Salad -- $10.99." She draws a small border of stars around the text. The colored chalk -- white, yellow, pink -- makes the board cheerful. She steps back and reads it. She adds "Shaah (Spiced Tea) -- $2.00" at the bottom. The permanent menu board on the wall behind her shows the full menu. The daily specials board catches customers' eyes as they enter.

### Scene 200: Adjusting the Thermostat
**Time:** 8:12 AM -- restaurant hallway
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, hallway near kitchen entrance
**Description:** Aisha adjusts the thermostat on the wall of the small hallway between the kitchen and dining room. The dial shows the temperature -- she turns it up from 60 (overnight setting) to 72 degrees. The heating unit clicks on and the warm air begins to flow through the vents. The hallway has a few hooks for aprons, a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall, and an "Employees Must Wash Hands" sign. A small calendar pinned to the wall shows the month with catering dates circled in red marker. The restaurant warms around her. She pulls on her apron strings, tightening the bow.

### Scene 201: Basra at the Window
**Time:** 7:30 AM -- bedroom, gray winter light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at window
**Description:** The orange tabby cat Basra sits on the bedroom windowsill, staring out at the Minneapolis winter morning. His amber eyes track a bird on a bare tree branch outside. His orange tail flicks back and forth slowly. The window shows the snowy front yard, bare trees, and the street below with parked cars covered in snow. Basra's ears are perked forward, his whiskers twitching. He presses one orange paw against the cold glass. Inside, the made bed with the burgundy comforter is visible behind him. The dresser with its hijab collection lines the wall. The room is empty -- Aisha has gone downstairs.

### Scene 202: Amina Feeds the Cat
**Time:** 6:52 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, near cat bowls
**Description:** Amina crouches beside Basra's food mat near the back door, scooping dry cat food into his metal bowl. The orange tabby cat rubs against her arm, purring loudly. Amina wears her school clothes -- jeans and a long-sleeved top, braids neat. She pours fresh water into the water dish. Basra begins eating immediately, crunching kibble. Amina strokes his orange back once and stands up. The cat food bag sits on the floor beside the mat. Through the kitchen window, the dark winter morning is visible. Aisha watches from the stove, stirring eggs, smiling at the interaction.

### Scene 203: Zahra Plays with Basra
**Time:** 5:00 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Townhouse living room
**Description:** Zahra sits on the living room carpet, dangling a feather toy on a string in front of Basra. The orange cat crouches low, eyes wide and fixed on the feather, tail lashing. Zahra giggles and jerks the toy upward -- Basra leaps, swatting with both paws. His orange body twists in the air. The feather escapes. Zahra laughs, her two puffs bouncing. She drags the toy across the carpet and Basra chases it, sliding on the smooth floor. The living room sofa, coffee table, and TV stand are in the background. A pile of Zahra's coloring books sit on the coffee table. The moment is pure play and joy.

### Scene 204: Hamza Does Homework at the Kitchen Table
**Time:** 8:00 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Hamza sits at the kitchen table with a textbook open, a notebook, and a pencil. He is working on a history essay, his brow furrowed in concentration. His phone sits face-down beside the notebook -- Aisha's rule: phone down during homework. He writes a few sentences, pauses, flips a page in the textbook, then writes more. A glass of water sits at his elbow. The kitchen is clean -- dinner not yet set out. The refrigerator hums. Through the window, the dark evening and falling snow are visible. Basra sits on the chair across from Hamza, curled up and dozing.

### Scene 205: Family Photo Wall
**Time:** 7:00 PM -- hallway light
**Setting:** Townhouse stairway wall
**Description:** The stairway wall of the townhouse displays a collection of framed family photos. The frames are various sizes and styles -- some gold, some black, some wood. The photos include: Aisha and Abdi's wedding photo (Aisha in a white dress with gold embroidery, Abdi in a suit), baby Hamza's first photo, Amina as a toddler in a red dress, Zahra's newborn photo in a hospital blanket, a family group photo at a park (all five members smiling), Hamza in a basketball jersey, Amina at a school science fair, and a photo of the restaurant opening day -- Aisha standing proudly under the "Hoyo's Kitchen" sign. The hallway light illuminates the memories.

### Scene 206: Snow Outside the Bedroom Window
**Time:** 6:30 AM -- gray dawn light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at window
**Description:** Through the bedroom window, a Minneapolis winter scene unfolds. Fresh snow has fallen overnight, covering the front yard, sidewalk, and parked cars in a smooth white blanket. Bare tree branches hold thin lines of snow. The sky is pale gray, the sun not yet visible. The street is quiet -- no footprints on the sidewalk yet. Inside, the window frame is cold to the touch. A thin line of frost edges the bottom pane. The burgundy comforter on the made bed is visible reflected faintly in the glass. The alarm clock reads 6:30. The morning world outside is white, cold, and still.

### Scene 207: Abdi's Ride-Share Car
**Time:** 7:00 AM -- kitchen, through window
**Setting:** Family kitchen, view through window
**Description:** Through the kitchen window, Abdi can be seen in the driveway, scraping snow off a dark blue sedan -- his ride-share vehicle. He wears a heavy jacket, beanie, and gloves. He scrapes the windshield with an ice scraper, his breath forming clouds. Aisha watches from the kitchen while pouring shaah into a travel mug for him. The kitchen is warm, the window slightly fogged from the contrast between inside and outside temperatures. She will bring the mug to the front door when he comes in to grab it. The family morning routine runs on multiple tracks.

### Scene 208: Helping Zahra with Shoes
**Time:** 7:20 AM -- front hallway
**Setting:** Townhouse front hallway
**Description:** Aisha kneels in the front hallway, helping Zahra pull on her purple snow boots. Zahra sits on the bottom step of the staircase, her small feet in thick socks. Aisha guides the first boot on, then the second, pulling the zipper up the side of each boot. Zahra's lavender coat is zipped, mittens are on, and the pom-pom hat is ready in Aisha's hand. The shoe rack beside them holds the family's footwear -- Abdi's large boots, Hamza's sneakers, Amina's winter boots, and Aisha's black shoes. Coats crowd the hooks above. The front door window shows the winter morning.

### Scene 209: Basra Sleeps in a Sunbeam
**Time:** 1:00 PM -- bedroom, winter sunlight
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, on the bed
**Description:** A rare patch of winter sunlight streams through the bedroom window, making a bright rectangle on the burgundy comforter. The orange tabby cat Basra lies stretched out in the sunbeam, belly up, paws limp, eyes closed in bliss. His orange fur glows golden in the sunlight. The dust motes float in the beam of light. The bedroom is empty and quiet -- the family is out, the house is still. The prayer rug is folded by the bed. The hijab collection sits on the dresser. The Quran and reading glasses are on the nightstand. Only Basra is home, soaking up a precious moment of winter sun.

### Scene 210: Aisha Texts Hamza from Restaurant
**Time:** 3:30 PM -- at restaurant desk
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, order desk
**Description:** Aisha sits at the small desk near the service window, texting Hamza on her phone. The message reads: "Hamza, don't forget to start your history paper. I mean it." She adds a small heart emoji after the stern message. Her phone shows previous texts from the family group chat. The desk has order forms, a pen, a calculator, and a small notebook. Through the service window, the kitchen is visible -- Omar stirring a pot. Aisha's teal hijab and white apron are slightly rumpled from the afternoon. She sets the phone down and picks up the pen to review an order form.

### Scene 211: Canjeero at Home -- Teaching Zahra
**Time:** 6:30 PM -- kitchen (home), weekday alternate
**Setting:** Family kitchen at home
**Description:** On a rare evening when Aisha is home early, she makes canjeero in the home kitchen with Zahra watching. Zahra stands on a step stool beside the stove, carefully observing. Aisha pours the thin batter onto the hot flat pan in a spiral. "See? Like a circle," she tells Zahra. The batter sizzles and forms the familiar lacy pattern. Zahra's eyes are wide with fascination. Aisha flips the canjeero -- golden brown underneath. Zahra claps her small hands. The home kitchen is warm, the gas stove flame blue, and the smell of cooking canjeero fills the air. Teaching the next generation.

### Scene 212: Mosque Visit -- Friday
**Time:** 1:00 PM -- mosque interior (supplemental)
**Setting:** Local mosque in Cedar-Riverside
**Description:** Aisha sits in the women's section of the local mosque for Friday (Jummah) prayer. She wears a cream hijab and a long dark blue dress -- her nicer going-out clothes. She sits on the carpeted floor among other women, many in colorful hijabs. The mosque interior is simple but beautiful -- green carpet, white walls, arched windows, Arabic calligraphy on the wall. Light streams through the windows. She sits in quiet contemplation, waiting for the prayer to begin. Zahra sits on her lap, looking around at the other women with curious eyes. The mosque is peaceful and still.

### Scene 213: Buying Supplies at Costco
**Time:** 10:00 AM -- Costco interior (supplemental)
**Setting:** Inside a Costco warehouse store
**Description:** Aisha pushes a large flat cart through a Costco warehouse, buying restaurant supplies in bulk. The cart holds two 50-pound bags of basmati rice, a case of canned tomatoes, a large jug of cooking oil, and jumbo packages of paper napkins and takeout containers. She wears her teal hijab, cream tunic, and a long black winter coat. She checks a handwritten list, crossing items off with a pen. The Costco aisle stretches wide, tall shelves loaded with bulk goods. Other shoppers push their own carts. Aisha turns down the spice aisle, looking for bulk cumin and coriander.

### Scene 214: Zahra's Bedtime Story
**Time:** 9:00 PM -- Zahra's bedroom, nightlight
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Aisha sits on the edge of Zahra's small bed, reading a picture book. Zahra lies under the purple star comforter, head on the pillow, the stuffed bunny beside her. The picture book has bright illustrations of animals -- Aisha holds it open so Zahra can see. She reads aloud, pointing to the pictures: "The cat walked slowly..." Zahra's eyes are heavy, blinking longer each time. The pink nightlight casts a soft glow. The shelf of stuffed animals -- giraffe, bunny, rainbow bear -- watches from across the room. Aisha's voice is low and soothing. Zahra's eyes finally close.

### Scene 215: Basra Knocks Over the Spice Jar
**Time:** 9:15 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen (home kitchen alternate), at counter
**Description:** In the home kitchen, the orange tabby cat Basra has jumped onto the counter and knocked over a small jar of turmeric. Bright yellow powder spills across the white counter in a vivid streak. Basra sits beside the mess, looking innocent, one orange paw dusted with yellow turmeric. Aisha discovers the scene, hands on her hips, shaking her head but smiling. She reaches for a cloth and begins wiping the turmeric -- it leaves a yellow stain on the cloth. The other spice jars on the counter are safe. Basra licks his turmeric-dusted paw unconcernedly. The kitchen counter needs extra scrubbing.

### Scene 216: Abdi Brings Aisha Tea in Bed
**Time:** 10:00 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Abdi appears in the bedroom doorway carrying a cup of shaah on a small saucer. Aisha is already in bed, propped against pillows, her Somali novel in her lap. He sets the cup on the nightstand beside her reading glasses. She looks up and smiles -- her warm, wide smile -- and thanks him. Steam curls from the cup. The lamplight makes the scene golden. Basra is curled at the foot of the bed, one ear turned toward Abdi. This small gesture -- tea brought without asking -- speaks of a long partnership. Aisha wraps her hands around the warm cup and takes a sip. The cardamom is perfect.

### Scene 217: Morning Dua (Supplication)
**Time:** 5:55 AM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, on bed edge
**Description:** After completing her Fajr prayer, Aisha sits on the edge of the bed with her hands raised, palms up, making dua (personal supplication). Her lips move silently. Her brown eyes are closed. The white prayer garment is still loosely over her shoulders. The green and gold prayer rug is still on the floor. The lamp casts warm light on her peaceful face. She prays for her family's health, her children's futures, her restaurant, and her parents back in Somalia. The moment is private and deeply personal. Basra watches from his spot, amber eyes glinting. The clock reads 5:55.

### Scene 218: Signing a Catering Contract
**Time:** 2:00 PM -- restaurant desk
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at order desk
**Description:** Aisha sits at the small desk near the service window, reviewing a catering contract printed on two pages. A customer has ordered catering for a large community event -- 50 people. The order includes bariis with lamb, suqaar, sambusas, salad, and shaah. Aisha reads through the items, quantities, and total price. She uses a calculator to double-check the math. She signs the bottom of the contract with a pen and dates it. She files a copy in a folder on the desk. The order will be for next Saturday. She begins a prep list on a fresh sheet of paper, planning the quantities.

### Scene 219: Teaching Fatima a Recipe
**Time:** 9:15 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha stands beside Fatima at the commercial stove, teaching her the exact technique for the restaurant's signature suqaar sauce. Aisha demonstrates: "First the onions until translucent, then the garlic for thirty seconds only -- don't burn it." Fatima watches intently, nodding. Aisha adds the tomato paste with a specific stirring motion. "See how I scrape the bottom? That flavor matters." She adds the spice blend -- cumin, coriander, turmeric -- in precise amounts from her palm. Fatima takes over the spoon and tries. Aisha watches, coaching gently. The knowledge passes from one cook to another.

### Scene 220: Afternoon Break -- Stretching
**Time:** 2:10 PM -- break room
**Setting:** Small break room behind kitchen
**Description:** Aisha stands in the break room, stretching after the lunch rush. She rolls her shoulders back and forward, then stretches her arms overhead, fingers interlocked. She bends to touch her toes -- her back is stiff from hours of standing and cooking. She rolls her neck in slow circles. Her feet ache in the closed-toe shoes. She sits on a chair and slips the shoes off for a moment, flexing her toes. The break room is quiet. Her cup of shaah is on the table. Through the thin wall, she can hear Omar and Fatima cleaning the kitchen. She takes a deep breath, puts her shoes back on, and stands up.

### Scene 221: Saturday Morning -- Restaurant Deep Clean
**Time:** 8:00 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, kitchen wide view
**Description:** Saturday morning begins with the weekly deep clean of the kitchen. Aisha, Omar, and Fatima scrub every surface. Aisha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor behind the stove with a stiff brush and soapy water. Grease and food residue come up in dark streaks. Omar degreases the exhaust hood filters, soaking them in hot water. Fatima sanitizes the inside of the walk-in refrigerator, wiping shelves with a disinfectant cloth. The kitchen smells of cleaning solution rather than food. Rubber gloves protect their hands. This weekly ritual keeps the kitchen up to health code. Music plays from a radio on the shelf.

### Scene 222: Family Saturday Breakfast
**Time:** 9:00 AM -- kitchen light, weekend morning
**Setting:** Family kitchen at home
**Description:** A leisurely Saturday breakfast at home -- no rush to school. The whole family sits around the kitchen table. Aisha has made a special Saturday canjeero with extra honey. Abdi drinks shaah and reads something on his phone. Hamza, still in pajamas, eats canjeero rolled with banana. Amina has scrambled eggs. Zahra sits in her chair with the stuffed bunny beside her plate, nibbling canjeero. Basra sits on a kitchen chair as if he is part of the family meeting. The kitchen window shows a gray Saturday sky. The pace is slow and relaxed -- a rare unhurried morning.

### Scene 223: Winter Walk to the Car
**Time:** 7:25 AM -- gray winter morning, heavy snow
**Setting:** Townhouse front, snowy street
**Description:** A heavy snow day. Aisha walks down the townhouse front steps in her long black winter coat, cream scarf, teal hijab, and black gloves, crunching through six inches of fresh snow. The minivan is buried under a white mound. She opens the back hatch and pulls out a snow brush with a long handle. She sweeps snow off the roof, then the hood, then the trunk. She scrapes the windshield. Her breath makes dense white clouds. The neighborhood is muffled and quiet under the snow. Other townhouses have smoke rising from chimneys. A snowplow rumbles in the distance.

### Scene 224: Zahra Makes a Snowman
**Time:** 4:00 PM -- gray winter afternoon, backyard
**Setting:** Townhouse backyard
**Description:** Zahra, bundled in her lavender coat, purple boots, pom-pom hat, and pink mittens, pats a small snowman in the townhouse backyard. The snowman is lopsided and child-sized -- three uneven snow spheres stacked up. Zahra presses two pebbles for eyes and a carrot for the nose. She wraps a small scarf around the neck. Amina helps balance the top ball, which keeps sliding off. They both laugh. The backyard has a wooden fence, bare bushes under snow, and a neighbor's window visible over the fence. Inside the kitchen window, Aisha watches, holding a cup of shaah, smiling. Basra sits on the indoor windowsill, watching the humans from the warmth.

### Scene 225: Restaurant Catering Prep Day
**Time:** 7:00 AM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, kitchen wide view
**Description:** A big catering day. Aisha arrived early -- 7:00 AM -- to start the catering prep for the community event. The kitchen is in full production mode. Three large aluminum foil trays line the prep table, waiting to be filled. A massive pot of bariis cooks on the stove -- enough for 50 people. Two pots of suqaar (one chicken, one lamb) simmer on other burners. Omar fries sambusas in batches -- the deep fryer crackles steadily. Fatima chops a mountain of onions, tomatoes, and cilantro for salad. Aisha orchestrates from the center, moving between stations, tasting, adjusting spices, checking quantities. The kitchen is warm and intense.

### Scene 226: Loading Catering Trays into the Minivan
**Time:** 10:30 AM -- back parking area
**Setting:** Behind Hoyo's Kitchen
**Description:** Aisha, Omar, and Fatima carefully carry the loaded catering trays out the back door to the silver Honda Odyssey. The trays are covered tightly in aluminum foil, labeled with the contents. Omar carries the largest tray -- bariis with lamb -- holding it level with both hands. Aisha slides trays onto the flat cargo area in the back of the minivan, bracing them with rolled towels so they do not slide. The sambusa tray goes on top, the salad containers on the side. The minivan is transformed into a food delivery vehicle. Cold air surrounds them. Aisha checks that everything is secure before closing the hatch.

### Scene 227: Delivering Catering
**Time:** 11:00 AM -- community center or office
**Setting:** Event venue entrance
**Description:** Aisha carries a foil-covered catering tray through the entrance of a community center, where the event is being set up. Tables with white tablecloths are arranged in a large room. The event organizer -- a Somali American woman in a green hijab -- greets Aisha and directs her to the food table. Aisha sets down the tray and removes the foil, revealing the mound of golden bariis topped with tender lamb, scattered cashews, and raisins. Steam rises. The organizer leans in and inhales the aroma with closed eyes. Aisha returns to the minivan for the remaining trays.

### Scene 228: Eid Preparation at Home
**Time:** 6:00 AM -- kitchen light, festive energy
**Setting:** Family kitchen at home (Eid morning)
**Description:** It is Eid al-Fitr morning. The kitchen is alive with festive preparation. Aisha cooks special Eid breakfast: halwa (a Somali sweet confection, golden and gelatinous) simmers in a pot, filling the house with its sweet cardamom aroma. A platter of dates is arranged on the table. Fresh canjeero is stacked high. A pot of extra-spiced shaah brews. The children are excited -- their voices carry from upstairs. Aisha wears a beautiful burgundy dirac (Somali dress) under her apron, with a matching hijab draped over her shoulder, ready to be put on properly after cooking. The house feels special.

### Scene 229: Eid Clothes
**Time:** 7:30 AM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom
**Description:** Aisha stands at the dresser mirror, adjusting her Eid outfit. She wears a beautiful burgundy dirac with gold embroidery along the neckline and hem. A matching burgundy hijab is draped elegantly, pinned with a decorative gold pin rather than the usual plain one. She wears small gold earrings visible at the edges of the hijab. Her face cream gives her brown skin a soft glow. She applies a touch of kohl (eyeliner) to her warm brown eyes. On the bed, three children's outfits are laid out -- Hamza's white button-down shirt and dark pants, Amina's blue dress with silver trim, and Zahra's tiny pink Eid dress with sparkles.

### Scene 230: Family Eid Photo
**Time:** 8:00 AM -- living room
**Setting:** Townhouse living room
**Description:** The whole family stands together for an Eid photo. Aisha in the center wears the burgundy dirac and hijab with gold accents, her widest smile beaming. Abdi stands beside her in a white dress shirt and dark pants, wearing a white kufi. Hamza is tall beside his father in a white shirt. Amina wears her blue dress with silver trim, braids decorated with small beads. Little Zahra stands in front, sparkly pink dress, two puffs tied with gold ribbons, gap-toothed grin. Abdi holds his phone extended for a selfie. Basra the orange cat sits at their feet, photobombing. The living room is tidy. "Eid Mubarak!" they say together.

## PART 11: SUPPLEMENTAL SCENES -- RESTAURANT CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND DETAILS

### Scene 231: Regular Customer -- The Professor
**Time:** 12:00 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room
**Description:** A university professor -- a non-Somali man with glasses and a messenger bag -- enters for his weekly lunch. Aisha greets him by name. He has been coming every Thursday for two years. He orders the lamb bariis without looking at the menu. He opens a book and reads while waiting. Aisha brings his plate and shaah. He thanks her and asks how the restaurant is doing. She tells him about the catering expansion. He nods encouragingly. Through the window, the university buildings are visible in the distance. The exchange is warm and regular -- a small-business owner and a loyal customer, connected through good food.

### Scene 232: Explaining the Menu to New Customers
**Time:** 12:30 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, at table
**Description:** Two young women in winter coats sit at a table, studying the menu with puzzled expressions. Aisha approaches and explains each dish with enthusiasm. "Suqaar is stir-fried chicken with vegetables and spices -- very flavorful. Bariis is our spiced basmati rice -- with cinnamon and cardamom. Sambusa is a fried triangle pastry filled with seasoned beef." She points to each item on the menu. The women nod, interested. One asks what she recommends for a first-timer. Aisha suggests the suqaar plate with a side of sambusa. "You'll love it," she says with her wide smile. They order it.

### Scene 233: A Child at the Restaurant
**Time:** 5:00 PM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, at table
**Description:** A Somali family dines in the restaurant. Their young son, about 7 years old, sits at the table drawing on a paper placemat with crayons that Aisha keeps behind the counter for young customers. He draws a picture of a sambusa (a large triangle with zigzag lines for the filling). Aisha walks by and looks at his drawing, praising it warmly. She brings him a small plate with a sambusa arranged to match his drawing. The boy's eyes light up. His parents laugh. The moment captures the restaurant's family-friendly atmosphere. The crayon box sits on the table beside the water glasses.

### Scene 234: Cleaning the Deep Fryer
**Time:** 8:10 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at deep fryer
**Description:** Aisha cleans the deep fryer at the end of the day. She has turned it off and let the oil cool. She carefully drains the used oil through a strainer into a large metal container for disposal. The old oil is dark and used-up. She wipes the inside of the fryer with paper towels, removing food bits and grease. She scrubs the fryer basket with a wire brush under hot water at the sink. The stainless steel fryer gleams when she finishes. Tomorrow it will get fresh oil. The cleaning is methodical -- she moves from one task to the next without pausing. The kitchen around her is being cleaned by the team.

### Scene 235: Counting the Cash Drawer
**Time:** 8:20 PM -- dining room, counter
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at cash register
**Description:** Aisha counts the cash drawer at the end of the day. She removes stacks of bills and coins, sorting them by denomination on the counter. Ones, fives, tens, twenties -- she counts each stack twice, lips moving silently. She writes the totals in a small ledger book with a pen. She compares the cash total to the register's daily report printout. The numbers match. She places the cash in a zippered bank deposit bag and locks it in a small safe under the counter. The credit card receipts are clipped together in a stack. Another good day of business. She closes the ledger and caps the pen.

### Scene 236: Basra Greets Aisha at the Door
**Time:** 8:52 PM -- front hallway, evening
**Setting:** Townhouse front door
**Description:** Aisha opens the front door after a long day at the restaurant. The orange tabby cat Basra is sitting right at the door, as if he has been waiting. He stands, stretches, and meows loudly -- a demanding, conversational meow. He rubs his whole body against Aisha's ankles as she steps inside, weaving between her feet. She bends down and scoops him up, holding him against her chest. Basra purrs loudly, his orange body vibrating. She buries her face in his soft fur for a moment. The warm house, the purring cat -- she is home. The hallway light is warm. Snow melts from her boots onto the mat.

### Scene 237: Making Shaah at Home -- Evening
**Time:** 9:30 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Aisha makes a small pot of shaah at home for herself and Abdi. The process is the same as at the restaurant but smaller -- a small saucepan, a few tea leaves, two cardamom pods, one small cinnamon stick, a splash of milk, a spoonful of sugar. She stirs it gently, watching the color turn from dark brown to warm caramel. The kitchen is quiet -- children are in their rooms. The familiar ritual of tea-making is calming. She strains it into two ceramic mugs. The spiced aroma fills the clean kitchen. She carries the mugs to the living room where Abdi waits on the sofa.

### Scene 238: Checking Restaurant Supplies List
**Time:** 10:05 PM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Aisha sits in bed with a small notebook and pen, writing tomorrow's restaurant supply list by lamplight. She lists: 20 lbs chicken breast (halal), canned tomatoes (6 cans), fresh cilantro, limes, onions (10 lbs), bell peppers (green and red), cooking oil. She taps the pen against her chin, thinking. She adds: napkins, takeout containers (medium), sambusa wrappers. The notebook is worn, pages filled with similar lists in her handwriting. She tears out the page and tucks it in her purse on the nightstand. The Quran, reading glasses, and alarm clock sit beside the purse. Basra kneads the comforter at her feet.

### Scene 239: Phone Call from a Catering Client
**Time:** 11:30 AM -- restaurant desk
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at order desk
**Description:** Aisha holds the phone to her ear, notepad ready, as a catering client discusses a wedding reception order. She writes quickly: 100 guests, bariis with lamb and chicken, 80 sambusas, Somali pasta, large salad, shaah for all guests. The order is the biggest she has received. Her eyes widen slightly at the quantity but she nods confidently, calculating in her head. She quotes a price, the client agrees. She writes the date circled twice, and the deposit amount. When she hangs up, she exhales and smiles -- the restaurant is growing. She calls Omar and Fatima over to discuss the prep plan.

### Scene 240: Wiping Down the Menu Board
**Time:** 10:30 AM -- dining room
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room, at menu board
**Description:** Aisha stands before the large permanent menu board on the dining room wall, wiping it with a damp cloth. The board is painted with the restaurant's name "Hoyo's Kitchen" at the top in decorative script, and lists all the dishes with prices in neat chalk lettering: Bariis iyo Hilib (Rice with Meat) $13.99, Suqaar (Stir-Fried Chicken) $11.99, Baasto (Somali Pasta) $10.99, Sambusa (3 pc) $5.99, Canjeero $3.99, Shaah Cadays (Spiced Tea) $2.00, Mango Juice $3.00. She touches up a smudged letter with chalk. The orange walls glow behind the board. The dining room is ready for customers.

## PART 12: FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL SCENES

### Scene 241: Morning Text to Family Group Chat
**Time:** 6:45 AM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Aisha sits at the breakfast table, typing a message into the family group chat on her phone while the children eat. The message is to Abdi (already out driving): "Salaams, lunches packed, kids almost ready. InshAllah see you tonight. Stay safe on the roads." She adds a small prayer emoji and hits send. Her cup of shaah sits beside the phone, steam rising. Hamza glances at his own phone -- the message appears. Amina's phone buzzes on the table. Zahra, too young for a phone, is focused on her banana slices. The family is connected, even apart.

### Scene 242: Basra on the Prayer Rug
**Time:** 5:44 AM -- bedroom, lamp light
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, at prayer rug
**Description:** Aisha unfolds her prayer rug on the carpet, but before she can step on it, the orange tabby cat Basra walks onto it and sits down right in the center, looking up at her with innocent amber eyes. The green and gold prayer rug looks beautiful with the orange cat as a centerpiece. Aisha smiles, shakes her head gently, and lifts the cat off the rug. He meows in protest. She sets him on the bed and smooths the rug again. Basra watches from the bed, tail flicking, as if insulted. Aisha begins her prayer. By the time she is in sujud, Basra has padded back to the edge of the rug, sitting just off it, watching.

### Scene 243: Zahra's First Day of Kindergarten (Flashback/Supplemental)
**Time:** 8:00 AM -- elementary school entrance
**Setting:** Elementary school, drop-off area
**Description:** A special scene: Zahra's first day of kindergarten. Aisha crouches at the school entrance, adjusting Zahra's brand-new pink backpack. Zahra's small face wavers between excitement and fear. Her two puffs bounce as she looks back at the school door. Aisha holds Zahra's small round face in her hands and speaks to her softly, reassuringly. Zahra nods bravely. A teacher crouches nearby, welcoming with a friendly smile. Aisha stands and Zahra walks toward the teacher, turning once to wave, then again, then once more. Aisha waves back each time, her warm brown eyes bright with emotion. She does not leave until Zahra is inside.

### Scene 244: Fixing the Restaurant Sink
**Time:** 2:30 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at kitchen sink
**Description:** The kitchen sink is draining slowly. Aisha is on her hands and knees under the sink, looking at the pipes. She has a wrench in one hand and a bucket under the P-trap. She turns the coupling with the wrench, loosening it. Water drains into the bucket. She clears the clog -- a mass of vegetable scraps and grease. She reconnects the pipe, tightens the coupling, and runs the water. It drains perfectly now. She stands up, wipes her hands on a towel, and puts the wrench back in a small toolbox under the shelf. Running a restaurant means fixing things yourself sometimes.

### Scene 245: Amina Helps at the Restaurant
**Time:** 5:00 PM -- dining room (weekend)
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen dining room
**Description:** On a busy Saturday evening, Amina helps out at the restaurant -- something she does occasionally. The 11-year-old wears a small apron over her casual clothes and a headband over her braids. She refills water glasses at tables, using a pitcher she holds with both hands. She is careful and serious about the task. Aisha watches from behind the counter, proud. Amina brings empty plates to the kitchen bus tub. A customer tells Amina the food was delicious, and Amina smiles shyly. "My mom made it," she says. Aisha beams from across the room.

### Scene 246: Snowy Morning Commute -- Heavy Traffic
**Time:** 7:50 AM -- inside minivan, snowy roads
**Setting:** Minneapolis streets, heavy snow
**Description:** A heavy snowstorm morning. Aisha drives the minivan slowly through Minneapolis streets, windshield wipers swishing fast against thick snowflakes. Traffic crawls -- red brake lights stretch ahead in a line. The roads are slick, tires crunching through fresh snow. She grips the steering wheel tightly, leaning forward slightly. The heater blasts. The dashboard clock reads 7:50. In the back, Zahra is calm, looking out the window at the snow. Amina texts on her phone. Aisha turns the radio to a traffic report. Schools are on a two-hour delay, but the restaurant opens regardless. She inches the van forward.

### Scene 247: End of Day Inventory Count
**Time:** 8:15 PM -- fluorescent kitchen light
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, walk-in refrigerator
**Description:** Aisha does the end-of-day inventory count in the walk-in refrigerator, clipboard in hand. She counts what is left: four portions of marinated chicken, half a pan of suqaar, a third of the bariis pot, twelve sambusas, two containers of salad. She writes each number on the clipboard. She notes what needs to be prepped fresh tomorrow. The refrigerator is cold -- her breath is visible. She checks the dates on the containers, pulling one forward that needs to be used first. She jots "order more chicken" on the clipboard. She exits the refrigerator, closing the heavy door, and hangs the clipboard on its nail.

### Scene 248: Locking Up the Restaurant
**Time:** 8:30 PM -- back entrance, dark
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, back door exterior
**Description:** Aisha stands outside the back door of Hoyo's Kitchen in the dark, cold night, locking the deadbolt with her key. The parking area behind the restaurant is quiet, a security light casting yellow on the snowy ground. Her breath makes white clouds. The restaurant is dark behind her -- all lights off, stove off, fryer off, doors locked. She pockets the keys in her coat and walks to the silver minivan, her boots crunching on the icy parking lot. She opens the driver's door, the interior light coming on. Another day at Hoyo's Kitchen is complete. She starts the engine and lets it warm.

### Scene 249: Video Call with Somali Relatives
**Time:** 9:00 PM -- living room, evening
**Setting:** Townhouse living room
**Description:** The whole family crowds around Aisha's phone for a video call with relatives in Mogadishu, Somalia. The phone screen shows an older woman (Aisha's mother) and several other family members in a bright room, waving and talking in rapid Somali. Zahra leans over Aisha's shoulder, waving frantically at the screen. Hamza waves briefly and goes back to his phone. Amina says "Habaryar!" (aunt) to someone on the screen. Abdi leans in to greet his mother-in-law. Aisha translates between the children (who mix English and Somali) and her mother. The living room is warm, the TV off, all attention on the small phone screen connecting two continents.

### Scene 250: Weekend Treat -- Somali Halwa
**Time:** 3:00 PM -- home kitchen
**Setting:** Family kitchen at home
**Description:** Aisha makes Somali halwa as a weekend treat. She stirs a thick golden mixture in a saucepan over medium heat -- the halwa is a confection of sugar, cornstarch, ghee, cardamom, and nutmeg. The mixture thickens as she stirs constantly with a wooden spoon. Ghee bubbles at the edges. The sweet, cardamom-rich aroma fills the kitchen. She adds a handful of cashews and stirs them in. She pours the halwa into a shallow dish to set. Zahra watches from a chair, eyes fixed on the golden sweetness. Basra sits on the floor, uninterested in sweets but present for the company. The halwa will set for an hour, then be cut into squares.

### Scene 251: Putting Zahra to Bed -- Dua
**Time:** 8:45 PM -- Zahra's bedroom, nightlight
**Setting:** Zahra's bedroom
**Description:** Aisha sits on the edge of Zahra's bed after the bedtime story. Zahra lies under the purple star comforter, eyes heavy. Aisha teaches her a simple bedtime dua: "Bismika Allahumma amutu wa ahya" (In Your name, O Allah, I die and I live). Zahra repeats the words in her small, sleepy voice, stumbling over the Arabic syllables. Aisha says it again slowly, and Zahra tries once more. Aisha smiles and kisses her forehead. "Good girl," she whispers. Zahra's eyes close. The stuffed bunny is tucked in. The nightlight glows pink. Aisha sits for a moment, then quietly slips out.

### Scene 252: Morning Dishwashing at Home
**Time:** 6:55 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Aisha washes the breakfast dishes quickly at the kitchen sink. She runs hot water, squeezing dish soap onto a sponge. She scrubs the canjeero pan -- the flat pan needs gentle attention. Plates go into the soapy water, then under the rinse. She stacks them in the drying rack. The shaah pot gets a quick scrub. Egg pan next. The sink fills with suds. Through the window, the gray morning grows lighter. The kitchen clock shows 6:55. The children's backpacks and lunch bags sit by the front hallway. Basra drinks from his water dish. The morning routine flows toward departure.

### Scene 253: Adjusting the Hijab in the Car
**Time:** 7:28 AM -- inside minivan
**Setting:** Honda Odyssey, parked
**Description:** Before driving, Aisha adjusts her hijab in the rearview mirror. The teal fabric has shifted slightly while she buckled Zahra in. She repins it with a straight pin from a small magnetic pin holder stuck to the dashboard -- a practical accessory for a hijabi driver. She tucks a fold under her chin, smooths the fabric over her shoulder, and checks the mirror. Neat and secure. The rearview mirror also shows Zahra in the booster seat behind her, chatting to the stuffed bunny. Amina is beside Zahra, scrolling her phone. The car is warm, the defroster clearing the last of the fog from the windshield.

### Scene 254: Filling Out a Health Inspection Form
**Time:** 10:00 AM -- restaurant desk
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen, at order desk
**Description:** Aisha fills out the annual health inspection preparation form at the restaurant desk. She reviews a checklist: food storage temperatures (logged daily), hand-washing station (stocked with soap and paper towels), cross-contamination prevention (color-coded cutting boards), cleaning schedule (posted on the wall), fire extinguisher (checked monthly). She checks each item with a pen. The clipboard rests on the desk. Her reading glasses are on her nose. The form is several pages. She takes the restaurant's safety seriously -- the health department grade of "A" is displayed proudly by the front door. She signs and dates the form.

### Scene 255: Basra Under the Kitchen Table
**Time:** 9:15 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, under the table
**Description:** A view from under the kitchen table during family dinner. The orange tabby cat Basra sits on the linoleum floor, surrounded by a forest of chair legs and human feet. Aisha's brown slippered feet are crossed at the ankles. Abdi's socked feet rest flat. Hamza's large sneakered feet are kicked out. Amina's purple-socked feet dangle from her chair. Zahra's tiny stocking feet barely reach past the seat. A canjeero crumb falls from above and Basra pounces on it, batting it across the floor. He settles back down, tail curled around his paws, waiting for the next crumb. The family's voices are muffled above.

### Scene 256: Restaurant Sign in Snow
**Time:** 7:00 AM -- gray winter morning
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen exterior, front
**Description:** The front of Hoyo's Kitchen in the early winter morning. The restaurant sign hangs above the glass front door -- "Hoyo's Kitchen" in red and gold lettering on a dark green background, with a small tagline "Authentic Somali Cuisine" below. Snow sits on top of the sign and on the window ledges. The "OPEN" sign in the window is dark -- not yet turned on. The sidewalk in front has been shoveled but is dusted with fresh snow. A few footprints cross the sidewalk. The Minneapolis street is quiet, cars parked along the curb under snow. The restaurant waits, cold and dark, for Aisha to arrive and bring it to life.

### Scene 257: Aisha Laughs with Staff
**Time:** 2:20 PM -- kitchen, break time
**Setting:** Hoyo's Kitchen kitchen, casual moment
**Description:** Aisha, Omar, and Fatima stand around the prep table during the afternoon break, laughing at something Omar said. Aisha leans against the table, one hand on her stomach, her wide smile filling her round face. Fatima covers her mouth with one hand, shoulders shaking with laughter. Omar grins, pleased with his joke. Three cups of shaah sit on the table between them, steaming. The kitchen is clean and quiet -- between lunch and dinner service. The fluorescent light is harsh but the moment is warm. These three people spend long hours in this kitchen together. The camaraderie is real and easy.

### Scene 258: End of a Long Day -- Sitting in the Minivan
**Time:** 8:35 PM -- dark parking area
**Setting:** Behind Hoyo's Kitchen, in the minivan
**Description:** Aisha sits in the driver's seat of the silver minivan in the dark parking area behind the restaurant. The engine is running, heater blowing, but she has not pulled out yet. She sits for a moment in the quiet -- just her, the dark, the falling snow illuminated by the headlights. The long day runs through her mind: the morning prayers, the children's breakfasts, the school runs, the cooking, the orders, the customers, the cleaning. Her hands rest on the steering wheel. She closes her eyes for ten seconds. Then she takes a breath, shifts into drive, and pulls out. Zahra sleeps in the back seat. Home is fifteen minutes away.

### Scene 259: Last Look at the Bedroom
**Time:** 10:50 PM -- bedroom, darkness
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, wide shot in darkness
**Description:** The bedroom is dark. The alarm clock glows 10:50 in green. Aisha lies in bed under the burgundy comforter, eyes closed, on the edge of sleep. Abdi sleeps beside her. The orange cat Basra is curled between them, a warm spot in the dark. The prayer rug is folded by the bed. The Quran is on the nightstand. The hijab collection sits on the dresser, ready for tomorrow. Through the window, snowflakes drift past, barely visible against the dark sky. The house is silent. Three children sleep in their rooms. The restaurant is locked and dark. Minneapolis sleeps under the snow. Aisha sleeps.

### Scene 260: Dawn Approaches
**Time:** 5:28 AM -- dark, faintest gray
**Setting:** Aisha's master bedroom, window
**Description:** Two minutes before the alarm. The bedroom is dark and still. Through the window, the faintest suggestion of gray touches the eastern sky above the Minneapolis rooftops -- not yet dawn, but the promise of it. The bare tree branches outside are black silhouettes against the deep gray sky. Snow covers everything in white. The alarm clock reads 5:28. Aisha lies still, one hand resting on Basra's warm fur. In two minutes, the alarm will sound, and she will begin again: prayer, breakfast, children, restaurant, cooking, serving, cleaning, family, prayer, sleep. The cycle of a full and devoted life. For now, two minutes of peace.
