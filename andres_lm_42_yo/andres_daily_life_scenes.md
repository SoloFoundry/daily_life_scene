# A Day in the Life of Andrés: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime illustrations depicting a full day in the life of Andrés Gómez, a 42-year-old Colombian tienda (neighborhood store) owner in Medellín.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Character Matters:**
- Represents a Colombian small business owner and neighborhood pillar
- Covers store/retail vocabulary in authentic Latin American commercial settings
- Shows family dynamics (father, husband) and work-life integration
- Introduces culturally specific items (tienda setup, Colombian products, aguapanela, arepa)
- Models a long workday with community interaction and neighborhood social life

---

### Scene Description Format

Each scene follows a consistent format for easy parsing and image generation:

```
### Scene NNN: [TITLE]
**Time:** [TIME] — [LIGHTING CONDITION]
**Setting:** [LOCATION], [CAMERA ANGLE/VIEW]

  - Character appearance and clothing
  - Character action/pose
  - All visible objects with details (color, material, brand if relevant)

```

**Key principles for scene descriptions:**
- **Third-person perspective** — Character is visible in scene
- **Extremely granular** — Each small action is a separate scene

- **Sensory details** — Textures, materials, colors, lighting
- **Consistent character** — Same clothing within time periods
- **Logical flow** — Scenes connect naturally

## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — WAKING AND GETTING READY (5:00 AM - 5:50 AM)

### Scene 001: The Alarm in Darkness
**Time:** 5:00 AM — complete darkness, faint phone glow
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, viewed from foot of bed
**Description:** A 42-year-old Colombian man with short dark brown hair and a neat mustache lies under a thin white cotton sheet beside his sleeping wife Lucía, a woman of 39 with long dark hair fanned across her pillow. On Andrés's wooden nightstand, his smartphone screen illuminates with the alarm, casting a pale blue-white glow across the bedside surface. He reaches toward it with one hand, eyes barely open. A glass of water and a small framed family photo sit on the nightstand. Above the bed, a small framed picture of the Virgin Mary hangs on the cream-colored wall. The ceiling fan overhead turns slowly in the darkness. The room is warm — Medellín's eternal spring climate keeps the night mild.

### Scene 002: Silencing the Phone Alarm
**Time:** 5:00 AM — faint phone glow
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés's thick, calloused hand swiping the phone screen to silence the alarm. The screen reads "5:00 AM" with a slider to dismiss. His fingers are broad, the hands of a man who stocks shelves and lifts boxes daily. Lucía stirs slightly beside him, pulling the sheet closer but not waking. The wooden nightstand surface shows a faint ring stain from the water glass. The small family photo in the frame shows Andrés, Lucía, and young Mateo at a park, all smiling.

### Scene 003: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 5:01 AM — near-total darkness, faint dawn glow
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, side view
**Description:** Andrés sits on the edge of the bed in a loose white cotton undershirt and dark shorts, his sleep clothes. His feet hover above the cool tile floor. He rubs his face with both hands, palms pressing against his eyes, then drags them down over his mustache. His short dark hair is slightly mussed from sleep, the receding hairline visible in the faint light filtering through thin curtains. Lucía's sleeping form is a gentle shape under the white sheet behind him. A pair of simple rubber sandals sits on the tile floor beside the bed, waiting.

### Scene 004: Slipping on Sandals
**Time:** 5:02 AM — near-total darkness
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, low angle close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés's bare feet sliding into rubber sandals on the cool ceramic tile floor. His toes are slightly broad, the feet of a man who stands all day behind a counter. The edge of his dark shorts hangs above his knees. Under the bed, a storage container and a pair of leather work shoes are barely visible in the shadows. The tile floor is cream-colored with a subtle pattern, common in Colombian apartments.

### Scene 005: Walking Quietly Past Son's Room
**Time:** 5:03 AM — dim hallway, no lights on
**Setting:** Apartment hallway, viewed from ahead
**Description:** Andrés walks quietly down the narrow apartment hallway in his undershirt and shorts, sandals making soft sounds on the tile. He passes his son Mateo's closed bedroom door — a small soccer team sticker (Atlético Nacional) decorates it at child height. Family photos line the wall: a wedding photo of Andrés and Lucía, Mateo's first communion, a group shot at a family gathering. The hallway is narrow, the walls painted a warm yellow. Andrés moves carefully, one hand trailing the wall, not wanting to wake his sleeping family.

### Scene 006: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 5:04 AM — harsh fluorescent light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, viewed from doorway
**Description:** Andrés enters the small family bathroom and flips the light switch. Harsh fluorescent light floods the compact space — white tiles on the walls, a pedestal sink with a round mirror above it, a toilet, and a shower stall with a plastic curtain patterned in blue stripes. A toothbrush holder mounted on the wall holds three toothbrushes (his, Lucía's, Mateo's). A bar of soap sits in a ceramic dish on the sink. The grout between the white tiles is slightly yellowed with age. A small window high on the wall is still dark.

### Scene 007: Splashing Water on Face
**Time:** 5:05 AM — fluorescent bathroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, medium shot at sink
**Description:** Andrés leans over the pedestal sink, cupping cold water in both hands and splashing it onto his face. Water drips from his mustache and chin back into the white basin. His eyes are squeezed shut against the cold splash. The chrome faucet runs a steady stream. His reflection in the round mirror shows a man shaking off sleep — olive-toned skin, dark eyebrows, the neat mustache now beaded with water droplets. A small shelf above the sink holds a can of shaving cream, a disposable razor, and a bottle of aftershave.

### Scene 008: Applying Shaving Cream
**Time:** 5:07 AM — fluorescent bathroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, close-up mirror reflection
**Description:** Andrés squirts white shaving cream from the can into his palm and spreads it across his cheeks and jaw, carefully avoiding his mustache. His reflection in the round mirror shows the white foam covering the lower half of his face except the mustache area. His brown eyes focus intently on the task. The razor waits on the sink's edge. A small towel hangs from a hook beside the mirror. Behind him in the reflection, the shower curtain and a hanging loofah are visible.

### Scene 009: Shaving Carefully
**Time:** 5:10 AM — fluorescent bathroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, close-up at mirror
**Description:** Andrés draws the disposable razor in careful downward strokes along his cheek, clearing a path through the white shaving cream. He tilts his chin up to get the neck area, pulling the skin taut with his free hand. The razor leaves smooth olive skin in its wake. He rinses the blade under the running faucet between strokes, tapping it against the sink. His mustache remains untouched and perfectly neat — trimmed but full, a point of pride. Tiny flecks of shaving cream dot the mirror's surface.

### Scene 010: Rinsing and Checking the Shave
**Time:** 5:14 AM — fluorescent bathroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, medium shot at sink
**Description:** Andrés cups water and rinses the remaining shaving cream from his face, then pats his skin dry with the small towel. He examines his reflection closely, turning his head left and right, checking for any missed spots. Satisfied, he applies a small splash of aftershave from the glass bottle, wincing slightly at the sting. The clean-shaven jaw contrasts with the neat dark mustache. He straightens up, looking more awake now, and hangs the towel back on its hook.

### Scene 011: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 5:16 AM — fluorescent bathroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, medium shot at sink
**Description:** Andrés squeezes toothpaste onto his toothbrush — a blue-handled one from the wall holder — and brushes vigorously, working the bristles across his teeth. White foam gathers at the corners of his mouth. He meets his own gaze in the round mirror, going through the automatic motions of a daily routine performed thousands of times. The faucet drips slowly. The bathroom window shows the first suggestion of pre-dawn gray in the sky outside.

### Scene 012: Returning to the Bedroom
**Time:** 5:19 AM — darkness with faint pre-dawn gray
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, viewed from door
**Description:** Andrés returns to the bedroom, the fluorescent bathroom light spilling a rectangle of light across the hallway floor behind him. Lucía is still asleep, curled on her side. He moves quietly to the small wooden wardrobe against the far wall, its door slightly warped with age. The ceiling fan continues its slow rotation overhead. The curtains glow faintly — the earliest hint of dawn beginning to lighten the Medellín sky.

### Scene 013: Opening the Wardrobe
**Time:** 5:20 AM — faint pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, at wardrobe
**Description:** Andrés opens the wardrobe door carefully, trying not to let it creak. Inside, his clothes hang in a simple row — several polo shirts in navy, green, and white, a few pairs of dark jeans, one button-down shirt for church. On the shelf above, folded t-shirts and shorts. On the floor of the wardrobe, his leather work shoes and a pair of sneakers. He selects a clean navy polo shirt and a pair of dark jeans, pulling them from the hangers with practiced quiet.

### Scene 014: Putting On the Polo Shirt
**Time:** 5:21 AM — growing pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés pulls the navy polo shirt over his head, tugging it down over his slightly stocky torso. The collar sits neatly around his neck, the short sleeves snug on his upper arms. The shirt is clean and pressed — Lucía keeps his work clothes well-maintained. He tucks the shirt loosely into the waistband of the jeans he has already stepped into. His silhouette is framed by the curtained window where pre-dawn light is slowly strengthening.

### Scene 015: Buckling Belt and Clipping Watch
**Time:** 5:23 AM — soft pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, close-up on hands
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés threading a brown leather belt through the loops of his dark jeans and buckling it with a simple metal buckle. Then he picks up his wristwatch from the nightstand — a basic silver analog watch with a leather strap — and clips it around his left wrist, checking the time: 5:23. His wedding ring, a plain gold band, catches the faint light on his left ring finger. Lucía murmurs something in her sleep. Andrés pauses, then continues silently.

### Scene 016: Lacing Up Leather Shoes
**Time:** 5:24 AM — soft pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, low angle
**Description:** Andrés sits on the edge of the bed and bends down to pull on his comfortable brown leather shoes — well-worn, the kind that can handle standing on a tile floor for sixteen hours. He ties the laces with quick practiced movements. The soles are slightly worn on the heels from years of pacing behind the tienda counter. The bed creaks faintly as he stands. He takes one last glance at Lucía sleeping peacefully, then heads for the door.

### Scene 017: Walking to the Kitchen
**Time:** 5:26 AM — early pre-dawn gray
**Setting:** Apartment hallway toward kitchen, viewed from behind
**Description:** Andrés walks down the hallway toward the kitchen, now fully dressed in his navy polo and jeans. The family photos on the wall are dim shapes in the low light. He passes the living room — a modest couch, a TV on a stand, Mateo's backpack tossed on a chair from the night before. Ahead, the kitchen doorway glows faintly with the first pale pre-dawn light coming through its window. The apartment smells faintly of last night's dinner.

### Scene 018: Turning On the Kitchen Light
**Time:** 5:27 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, wide shot from doorway
**Description:** Andrés flips the kitchen light switch, illuminating the small but functional space. Colorful hand-painted tiles form the backsplash behind the gas stove — a common decorative touch in Colombian homes, with patterns in blue, yellow, and orange. A compact refrigerator hums in the corner. Open shelves hold mismatched plates, cups, and glass jars of rice, sugar, and coffee. The counter is clean, a wooden cutting board leaning against the tile wall. A small window above the sink shows the dark blue pre-dawn sky.

### Scene 019: Filling the Coffee Pot
**Time:** 5:28 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, at the stove
**Description:** Andrés fills a small aluminum pot with water from the kitchen faucet, then places it on the gas stove. He turns the burner knob and a blue flame whooshes to life under the pot. A glass jar of ground Colombian coffee sits on the counter nearby — dark roasted, the label reading "Sello Rojo." The cloth strainer (manga) — a traditional Colombian coffee filter made of woven cotton fabric stretched over a wire frame — hangs from a hook on the wall, waiting. Andrés watches the pot as tiny bubbles begin forming at the bottom.

### Scene 020: Straining the Coffee Through the Manga
**Time:** 5:32 AM — warm kitchen light, steam rising
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, close-up on hands
**Description:** Andrés holds the cloth strainer (manga) over a ceramic pitcher and pours the now-boiling water through two spoonfuls of ground coffee he has placed in the filter. Dark brown tinto streams through the woven cotton, fragrant steam rising in curling wisps. He pours slowly, letting the water extract the coffee fully. The rich aroma of fresh Colombian coffee fills the small kitchen. The cloth strainer darkens with the wet grounds. This is the traditional way to make tinto — no machine, just fabric and patience.

### Scene 021: Pouring Coffee into a Cup
**Time:** 5:34 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Andrés pours the freshly strained tinto from the ceramic pitcher into a small white ceramic cup. The coffee is dark, almost black, steaming. He adds one spoonful of sugar from the glass jar and stirs with a small spoon, the metal clinking against the ceramic. He takes the first sip standing at the counter, closing his eyes briefly — this first cup is a private ritual before the long day begins. The kitchen window now shows a lighter blue sky, dawn approaching.

### Scene 022: Heating the Arepa
**Time:** 5:36 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Andrés places a pre-made white corn arepa on a flat griddle pan (budare) on the stove's second burner, turning the flame to medium. The arepa is round and flat, about the size of his palm, made from ground corn dough. He lets it cook, flipping it once with a spatula when the bottom turns golden with dark spots. The surface crisps and the kitchen fills with the warm, toasted smell of cooked corn. His coffee cup sits on the counter nearby, steam still rising.

### Scene 023: Preparing the Arepa with Butter and Cheese
**Time:** 5:40 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, at counter close-up
**Description:** Close-up of the golden arepa on a small plate. Andrés slices it open horizontally with a knife, revealing the soft white interior. He spreads butter inside — it melts immediately from the heat — then places a thick slice of white queso fresco on top, which begins to soften and go slightly gooey. He presses the arepa closed, the cheese oozing at the edges. A simple, perfect Colombian breakfast. He picks it up with one hand, coffee cup in the other.

### Scene 024: Eating Breakfast Standing at the Counter
**Time:** 5:42 AM — warm kitchen light, dawn brightening
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés stands at the counter eating his arepa in efficient bites, holding the coffee cup between bites. Crumbs fall onto the counter. He chews thoughtfully, already mentally planning the day — the bakery delivery should come at six, he needs to call the egg supplier, the shelves need restocking. He checks his phone briefly, scrolling through WhatsApp messages — a supplier confirms a delivery, a neighbor asks if he has cooking oil. He types a quick reply one-handed, arepa in the other.

### Scene 025: Rinsing the Cup and Plate
**Time:** 5:46 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Andrés's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Andrés places his empty coffee cup and plate in the sink and runs water over them, giving them a quick rinse. He wipes his hands on a small kitchen towel hanging from the oven handle. The kitchen is neat — he doesn't want to leave Lucía a mess when she wakes. Through the window above the sink, the sky has brightened to a pale blue-gray. The sounds of Medellín waking up are faint — a distant motorcycle, a rooster somewhere in the neighborhood.

### Scene 026: Heading to the Interior Stairway
**Time:** 5:48 AM — pre-dawn apartment light
**Setting:** Apartment hallway near stairway door, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés walks to the door at the end of the hallway that leads to the interior stairway connecting his apartment to the tienda below. He takes a ring of keys from a hook on the wall — several brass and silver keys on a worn leather keychain. He pats his back pocket to check for his wallet, touches his front pocket for his phone. Everything accounted for. He opens the door, revealing the narrow stairway descending into darkness.

### Scene 027: Descending the Stairs to the Tienda
**Time:** 5:49 AM — dark stairway
**Setting:** Interior stairway, viewed from above
**Description:** Andrés descends the narrow interior stairs from his apartment to the tienda below, one hand on the metal railing, keys jangling in the other. The stairs are concrete with a rubber non-slip strip on each step's edge, worn smooth in the center from years of trips up and down. The stairway is tight — barely wide enough for two people — with plain white walls. At the bottom, the tienda's back door is closed and dark. His leather shoes echo on each step. The stairway smells faintly of the store's products — soap, coffee, fruit.

## PART 2: OPENING THE TIENDA (5:50 AM - 6:30 AM)

### Scene 028: Unlocking the Back Door
**Time:** 5:50 AM — dark tienda interior
**Setting:** Tienda back entrance, close-up on door
**Description:** Andrés reaches the bottom of the stairs and inserts a key into the heavy lock on the back door that separates the stairway from the tienda. The lock clicks open and he pushes the door inward. The tienda interior is completely dark, the shapes of shelves and the refrigerated case barely visible as dark silhouettes. The refrigerator hums steadily — it runs all night to keep drinks and perishables cold. A faint smell of fruit, cleaning products, and cardboard greets him.

### Scene 029: Turning On the Tienda Lights
**Time:** 5:51 AM — sudden fluorescent brightness
**Setting:** Tienda interior, wide shot from back
**Description:** Andrés flips the main light switch near the back door, and rows of fluorescent tube lights flicker on across the ceiling, illuminating the tienda in bright white light. The store reveals itself: four rows of metal shelves stocked with products — canned goods, rice bags, cooking oil, cleaning supplies, snacks, toiletries. Against the right wall, a large glass-fronted refrigerated display case shows rows of bottled drinks — Colombiana soda, Coca-Cola, Postobón, water bottles, and beer. The front counter sits at the entrance end with a simple cash register, a glass bread display case, and stacked plastic bags. Everything is tidy — Andrés swept and organized before closing last night.

### Scene 030: Checking the Refrigerated Case
**Time:** 5:53 AM — fluorescent tienda light
**Setting:** Tienda, at refrigerated display case
**Description:** Andrés walks to the large glass-fronted refrigerated case and peers inside, checking that everything is cold and properly arranged. Rows of Colombiana soda in orange-labeled bottles, green Postobón apple soda, Coca-Cola bottles, and water bottles line the shelves. On the bottom shelf, eggs in cardboard cartons and a few blocks of cheese wrapped in plastic. He adjusts a few bottles that have shifted, straightening the rows. The glass door has a chrome handle, slightly cold to the touch. Condensation beads on the inside of the glass.

### Scene 031: Wiping Down the Counter
**Time:** 5:55 AM — fluorescent tienda light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés takes a damp cloth from under the counter and wipes down the main counter surface — a sturdy wooden counter topped with a sheet of glass, edges slightly chipped with age. The simple electronic cash register sits at one end, its screen dark until he presses the power button. A small scale for weighing produce sits beside it. A glass display case for bread (currently empty, awaiting the morning delivery) takes up the other end of the counter. He wipes methodically, preparing for the first customers.

### Scene 032: Powering On the Cash Register
**Time:** 5:56 AM — fluorescent tienda light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés pressing the power button on the small electronic cash register. The screen flickers to life with a green digital display. He opens the cash drawer, checks the starting float — neat stacks of small-denomination bills and coins separated into compartments. Colombian pesos: 1,000-peso and 2,000-peso bills, stacks of 200-peso and 500-peso coins. He counts quickly under his breath, confirming the total, then closes the drawer with a satisfying click. Everything is in order.

### Scene 033: Filling the Coffee Thermos
**Time:** 5:58 AM — fluorescent tienda light
**Setting:** Tienda, behind counter at small preparation area
**Description:** Andrés has a small area behind the counter where he prepares coffee for sale. He fills a large stainless steel thermos with tinto he prepared upstairs — a second batch, stronger and in larger quantity for customers. The thermos is tall with a pump-top dispenser. Beside it, a stack of small disposable cups and a jar of sugar with a spoon. Selling tinto is a key part of the morning business — neighborhood workers stop for coffee before their commutes. Steam escapes as he fills the thermos.

### Scene 034: Walking to the Front Entrance
**Time:** 6:00 AM — fluorescent light inside, dawn light outside
**Setting:** Tienda interior looking toward entrance
**Description:** Andrés walks the length of the store toward the front entrance, passing shelves stocked with goods on either side. The floor is smooth gray concrete, swept clean. At the front, the metal security shutters (reja) are rolled down, blocking the entrance completely — heavy corrugated steel painted dark green, padlocked at the bottom. Through the tiny gaps between the slats, faint dawn light and the sounds of the waking neighborhood filter in — a bus rumbling past, birds calling, distant music from a radio.

### Scene 035: Unlocking the Padlock
**Time:** 6:00 AM — fluorescent light, dawn seeping through shutters
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, low angle
**Description:** Andrés crouches at the bottom of the metal security shutters and inserts a key into the heavy padlock securing them to a bolt in the floor. The lock is well-oiled — he maintains it carefully. He unclips the padlock and tucks it into his back pocket. The shutters rattle slightly, ready to be raised. Through the narrow gap at the floor, the sidewalk is visible — still mostly empty in the early dawn, a stray cat slinking past.

### Scene 036: Rolling Up the Security Shutters
**Time:** 6:01 AM — morning light flooding in
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, viewed from inside
**Description:** Andrés grips the bottom edge of the metal security shutters and heaves them upward. The corrugated steel rolls up with a tremendous rattling clang — the signature sound of a tienda opening, familiar to every Colombian neighborhood. Morning light floods into the store in a golden wave. The Laureles neighborhood street is revealed: a narrow road lined with low-rise buildings, a few pedestrians walking, a motorcycle buzzing past, trees lining the sidewalk. The air smells fresh — morning in Medellín, spring-like year round. Andrés pushes the shutters all the way up and locks them in the open position.

### Scene 037: Propping Open the Front Door
**Time:** 6:02 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, from outside looking in
**Description:** View from the sidewalk looking into the tienda. Andrés props the entrance open wide, hooking the door to the wall with a simple metal latch. The store's interior is visible — brightly lit shelves stocked with colorful products, the counter at the back. Above the entrance, a hand-painted sign reads "TIENDA DON ANDRÉS" in red and yellow letters on a white background. A few crates are visible along the front wall inside, ready for produce display. Andrés stands in the doorway, hands on hips, surveying the quiet morning street. His navy polo is crisp, his expression alert and ready.

### Scene 038: Setting Out Fruit Crates
**Time:** 6:05 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, outside on sidewalk
**Description:** Andrés carries two wooden crates from inside the store and sets them on the sidewalk flanking the entrance. One holds bananas — a large bunch of yellow-green plantain bananas and smaller sweet bananas. The other holds a mix: ripe mangoes with red-yellow skin, green avocados, and a pile of limes. He arranges them attractively, turning the best fruit outward. The crates on the sidewalk signal to the neighborhood that the tienda is open for business. A neighbor walking past waves and calls "¡Buenos días, Don Andrés!" and he waves back warmly.

### Scene 039: Receiving the Bakery Delivery
**Time:** 6:10 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, delivery interaction
**Description:** A young man arrives on a motorcycle with a large plastic crate strapped to the back — the bakery delivery. He pulls up to the curb and hands Andrés two large bags of fresh bread: white rolls (pan francés), pan de bono (cheese bread made with yuca flour, slightly golden and round), and a stack of flat buñuelos. Andrés checks the count, nods, and hands the delivery man a folded bill. The bread is still warm, the bags slightly translucent with steam. The smell of fresh baked goods wafts into the store.

### Scene 040: Arranging Bread in the Display Case
**Time:** 6:13 AM — fluorescent light and morning light mixed
**Setting:** Tienda counter, at glass display case
**Description:** Andrés arranges the fresh bread in the glass display case on the counter, using metal tongs to place each piece carefully. The pan de bono goes in neat rows — golden, round, slightly cracked on top. White rolls fill another tray. The buñuelos, golden fried cheese balls, get their own small tray. He places a small handwritten price sign in front of each: "$1,000" for pan de bono, "$800" for rolls. The glass case catches the light, the bread looking warm and inviting. This display draws the first morning customers reliably.

### Scene 041: First Customer — Morning Tinto
**Time:** 6:20 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** The first customer of the day approaches the counter — an older man in work clothes, a construction hard hat tucked under his arm. "¡Un tintico, Don Andrés!" he says warmly. Andrés smiles and pumps the thermos dispenser, filling a small disposable cup with dark, steaming tinto. He passes it across the counter along with the sugar jar. The customer adds sugar, stirs with a tiny plastic spoon, and takes a grateful sip. They exchange brief morning pleasantries. Andrés rings up the sale — 800 pesos — the register beeping softly.

### Scene 042: Serving Multiple Morning Coffee Customers
**Time:** 6:30 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, wider shot with several customers
**Description:** A small cluster of morning customers stands at the counter — three neighborhood workers stopping for coffee before their commutes. Andrés moves efficiently, pumping tinto into disposable cups for each. A woman in a housemaid's uniform also buys a pan de bono, which Andrés pulls from the display case with tongs and places in a small paper bag. Coins and small bills pass across the counter. The cash register beeps with each transaction. The morning has begun in earnest — the tienda hums with the comfortable rhythm of routine.

---

## PART 3: MORNING AT THE TIENDA (6:30 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Scene 043: Housewife Buying Morning Groceries
**Time:** 7:15 AM — bright morning light through entrance
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer at counter
**Description:** A middle-aged woman — a neighborhood regular — places items on the counter: a bag of white rice, a carton of eggs, two tomatoes, and a bunch of cilantro. Andrés weighs the tomatoes on the small counter scale, watching the needle settle. He adds up the prices on a small notepad, calculating quickly in his head — a skill honed over years. He announces the total and bags the groceries in a thin plastic bag, tying the handles in a knot. She hands him a crumpled 10,000-peso bill; he counts back change from the register.

### Scene 044: Weighing Produce on the Scale
**Time:** 7:16 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up on scale
**Description:** Close-up of the small analog counter scale as Andrés places green plantains on the metal tray. The needle swings and settles on 800 grams. The scale is old but reliable — chrome base, white face with black numbers, a worn metal weighing tray. Beside the scale, a small handwritten price card reads "Plátano - $2,500/kg." Andrés's hands are steady, one holding the plantains in place, the other poised to note the weight. Behind the scale, the edge of the glass bread display case is visible.

### Scene 045: Selling Individual Eggs
**Time:** 7:45 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** An elderly woman buys eggs individually — a common practice at Colombian tiendas where customers buy exactly what they need. Andrés carefully lifts eggs one by one from the cardboard carton below the counter and places them in a small plastic bag, counting aloud: "uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis." Six eggs, each handled gently. The woman watches, purse clutched in both hands. These are brown eggs, farm-sourced, slightly dusty. He twists the bag gently and quotes the price. She counts out coins from a small change purse.

### Scene 046: Young Mother Buying Baby Supplies
**Time:** 8:10 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, at shelves near counter
**Description:** A young woman with a baby on her hip browses the shelf near the counter. She picks up a package of diapers, a small container of powdered milk, and a box of baby cereal. Andrés rings up the items, making faces at the baby, who giggles. The mother smiles gratefully — the tienda saves her a trip to the larger supermarket across town. Andrés bags the items and offers the baby a small piece of bocadillo (guava paste candy) — "con permiso de la mamá," he says, asking the mother's permission first.

### Scene 047: Restocking Canned Goods from Boxes
**Time:** 8:45 AM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, at shelves, mid-aisle
**Description:** During a quiet moment between customers, Andrés hauls a cardboard box from the storage room and crouches in front of the canned goods shelf. He pulls cans of beans, tuna, sardines, and tomato sauce from the box, placing each in its designated spot on the metal shelf. Labels face forward — a habit of neatness. The shelves are organized by category: canned foods on one section, cooking ingredients on another, cleaning products on a third. He rotates stock — older cans to the front, fresh ones behind.

### Scene 048: Organizing Cleaning Products
**Time:** 8:55 AM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, cleaning supplies aisle
**Description:** Andrés straightens the cleaning products section — bottles of bleach, floor cleaner, dish soap, and laundry detergent arranged on a lower shelf. He notices a bottle of Fab detergent is nearly out of stock and makes a mental note to add it to the wholesale list. Small packets of single-use detergent hang from a wire display rack — sold individually for customers who buy day-by-day. This is a key feature of tiendas: selling in small quantities that match working-class budgets.

### Scene 049: Arranging Snack Display
**Time:** 9:05 AM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter area, snack display
**Description:** Andrés restocks the snack display near the counter — a wire rack and small hanging clips. He hangs bags of Margarita potato chips, De Todito mixed snacks, and small packages of colombinas (hard candies). On the counter, he refills a glass jar with bon bon bum lollipops — the iconic Colombian lollipop with bubblegum center, in colorful wrappers. Another jar holds bocadillo (guava paste) squares wrapped in banana leaves. The display is colorful and positioned at eye level for children.

### Scene 050: Answering a Phone Call from Supplier
**Time:** 9:20 AM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, on phone
**Description:** Andrés's phone rings and he answers, leaning against the counter. It's a supplier confirming tomorrow's delivery of eggs and cheese. Andrés cradles the phone between ear and shoulder while jotting notes on a small notepad — quantities, prices, delivery time. His handwriting is cramped but legible. He negotiates briefly on the egg price — "¿No me puede dar mejor precio, hermano?" — asking for a better deal. The conversation is friendly but businesslike. He hangs up and adds the notes to his inventory list.

### Scene 051: Selling Cell Phone Minutes
**Time:** 9:40 AM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A teenage boy approaches the counter wanting to buy cell phone minutes (recargas) — a common service at Colombian tiendas. Andrés opens the recarga app on his phone, asks the boy for his phone number and carrier, enters the amount — 5,000 pesos — and confirms the transaction. A small sign on the counter wall advertises "RECARGAS AQUÍ" with logos of Claro, Movistar, and Tigo. The boy pays in coins. This digital service is a small but steady revenue stream.

### Scene 052: Sweeping the Tienda Floor
**Time:** 10:00 AM — bright light, sun higher
**Setting:** Tienda interior, full length view
**Description:** Andrés takes a broom — a traditional Colombian escoba with a thick wooden handle and stiff yellow bristles — and sweeps the gray concrete floor of the tienda. He works from the back toward the entrance, sweeping dust, a crushed paper cup, and crumbs into a small pile near the door. The broom's bristles scrape rhythmically against the concrete. The store is temporarily empty of customers, giving him a few minutes to tidy up. Morning sunlight streams through the entrance, catching dust motes in golden beams.

### Scene 053: School Children Buying Snacks
**Time:** 10:15 AM — bright mid-morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, from behind counter
**Description:** A group of four school children in uniforms — white shirts and dark blue pants or skirts — burst into the tienda during recess from the nearby school. They crowd the counter excitedly, pointing at the snack display. "¡Un chocoramo!" "¡Bon bon bum de fresa!" "¡Papitas!" Andrés serves them patiently, pulling a chocoramo (a chocolate-covered cake bar) from the display, a strawberry lollipop from the jar, and a small bag of chips. The children count out coins on the counter — 200-peso and 500-peso pieces — and Andrés helps the smallest child count correctly.

### Scene 054: Helping a Child Count Coins
**Time:** 10:17 AM — bright mid-morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up on hands and coins
**Description:** Close-up of the counter surface where a small child's hand pushes coins forward in a messy pile. Andrés's larger hands gently sort the coins — separating 200-peso brass coins from 500-peso silver ones. "Doscientos, cuatrocientos, seiscientos..." he counts aloud, teaching the child. The child watches intently, a lollipop already unwrapped in the other hand. Behind them, the other school children chat and compare their snacks. A chocoramo wrapper lies partially torn on the counter. Andrés's mustache curves with a warm smile as the child beams at getting the count right.

### Scene 055: Selling Cooking Oil and Rice
**Time:** 10:45 AM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A heavyset woman places a large bottle of cooking oil and a two-kilogram bag of white rice on the counter. Andrés scans the items mentally — he knows every price by heart, no barcode scanner needed. He announces the total and bags the heavy items in a doubled plastic bag for strength. The cooking oil bottle is golden-yellow, the rice bag printed with a mountain logo. These staples move fast — rice and oil are foundational to every Colombian household's kitchen.

### Scene 056: Receiving a Produce Delivery
**Time:** 11:00 AM — bright late-morning light
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, delivery from outside
**Description:** A small truck pulls up outside the tienda and a delivery man carries in two heavy sacks — one of potatoes and one of onions. Andrés inspects the potatoes, squeezing a few, checking for soft spots. He nods approval and helps carry the sacks to the storage room, walking them through the narrow aisle between shelves. The potatoes are yellow papa criolla, small and round, a Colombian staple. The onions are large and purple-skinned. He signs a delivery slip on a clipboard and the truck departs.

### Scene 057: Stacking Inventory in Storage Room
**Time:** 11:10 AM — dim storage room light
**Setting:** Tienda storage room, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés stacks the new potato and onion sacks in the small storage room behind the main store area. The room is tight, with metal utility shelves lining both walls, loaded with boxes of inventory — canned goods, drink bottles, snacks, cleaning products. A single fluorescent tube lights the space, dimmer than the main store. A clipboard with inventory lists hangs from a nail on the wall. Andrés stacks the heavy sacks carefully, grunting slightly with the weight. The air in the storage room is close and smells of cardboard and earth from the potatoes.

### Scene 058: Updating Inventory on Clipboard
**Time:** 11:15 AM — dim storage room light
**Setting:** Tienda storage room, close-up
**Description:** Andrés takes the clipboard from the wall and checks off the received items with a pen — potatoes, onions, confirmed quantities. He scans the list for what still needs ordering: eggs are running low, need more cooking oil, cheese supply is thin. He circles these items, adding quantities in the margin. His handwriting fills the lined paper in neat columns. The clipboard is battered, the metal clip slightly bent from use. A calculator sits on the shelf nearby, but Andrés does most of the math in his head.

### Scene 059: Selling Cold Drinks
**Time:** 11:30 AM — bright light, sun warming the street
**Setting:** Tienda counter and refrigerated case
**Description:** As the mid-morning heat builds, customers come for cold drinks. Andrés opens the glass door of the refrigerated case and pulls out an ice-cold Colombiana soda for a customer — the orange-flavored national soda, condensation dripping down the glass bottle. He pops the metal cap off with a wall-mounted bottle opener attached to the counter's side, the cap clattering into a bucket below. The customer takes the bottle gratefully, the cold glass sweating. Another customer asks for a water bottle. The refrigerated case hums louder as warm air enters each time the door opens.

### Scene 060: Opening a Soda with Wall-Mounted Opener
**Time:** 11:31 AM — bright light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés placing a Colombiana soda bottle cap under the wall-mounted metal bottle opener and levering it off with a practiced pop. The cap bends and falls into a small plastic bucket attached below the opener, already half-full with caps from previous drinks. The amber liquid inside the bottle fizzes and a tiny wisp of carbonation escapes the open neck. Andrés wraps a paper napkin around the sweating bottle before handing it to the customer. The opener is chrome, bolted to the counter's side — a permanent tienda fixture.

### Scene 061: Midday Lull — Leaning on Counter
**Time:** 11:45 AM — bright midday light, warm
**Setting:** Tienda counter, medium shot
**Description:** The late morning rush has passed, and the tienda is momentarily empty. Andrés leans on the counter with both forearms, gazing out the open entrance at the street. The midday sun falls in a bright rectangle on the concrete floor near the entrance. He drums his fingers lightly on the glass countertop. A fly buzzes past. The radio behind the counter plays vallenato music softly — an accordion and singer telling a romantic story. Andrés hums along, his mustache twitching with the melody. It's a rare quiet moment.

---

## PART 4: MIDDAY AND AFTERNOON (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

### Scene 062: Lucía Bringing Lunch
**Time:** 12:30 PM — bright midday light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, from behind
**Description:** Lucía appears from the back door that leads to the apartment stairs, carrying a tray covered with a clean cloth. She's a warm-faced woman of 39 with long dark hair pulled back, wearing a casual cotton dress. She sets the tray on a small table behind the counter — there's no separate break room, so Andrés eats right here. "Tu almuerzo, mi amor," she says. Andrés smiles and kisses her cheek. She checks the store briefly, straightens a product on a shelf, then heads back upstairs.

### Scene 063: Uncovering the Lunch Tray
**Time:** 12:32 PM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda, behind counter at small table, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés lifting the cloth from the tray to reveal a bandeja paisa — the iconic dish of Medellín. A large plate holds red kidney beans in thick sauce, white rice, ground meat (carne molida), a fried egg with crispy edges, a sweet fried plantain (maduro) cut lengthwise, a golden arepa, and a small salad of avocado and tomato on the side. A glass of fresh lulo juice sits beside the plate, pale green and frothy. The plate is piled high — Lucía makes sure her husband eats well for the long day.

### Scene 064: Eating Lunch Behind the Counter
**Time:** 12:35 PM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda, behind counter, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés sits on a wooden stool behind the counter, eating his bandeja paisa with a fork, balancing the plate on his knee. He eats with the focused appetite of a working man — scooping beans and rice together, cutting the fried egg into the mix. Between bites, he glances up at the entrance, ready to serve any customer who appears. The plate rests precariously; he's mastered eating like this over years. A customer enters and he sets the fork down, stands, serves them a bag of chips, sits back down. The meal is good — Lucía's cooking is his daily fuel.

### Scene 065: Sipping Lulo Juice
**Time:** 12:42 PM — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda, behind counter, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés lifting the glass of lulo juice and drinking deeply. The juice is pale green, slightly thick and tangy — made from the lulo fruit native to Colombia, blended with water and sugar. Condensation runs down the outside of the glass. His mustache gets a thin line of foam which he wipes with the back of his hand. The empty plate sits behind him on the table. He feels the energy of the meal settling in — the afternoon stretch ahead will be long, but lunch has fortified him.

### Scene 066: Customer During Lunch — Quick Service
**Time:** 12:50 PM — bright midday light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A man in a mechanic's uniform, hands still grease-stained, enters and asks for a cold Colombiana and a package of crackers. Andrés sets down his juice glass, stands from the stool, and serves the customer efficiently — pulling the soda from the fridge, popping the cap, grabbing the crackers from the shelf behind him. The mechanic pays, nodding thanks, and leaves. Andrés returns to his stool. Running a tienda means lunch is never uninterrupted — but he doesn't mind. These quick exchanges are the rhythm of his life.

### Scene 067: Clearing the Lunch Tray
**Time:** 1:00 PM — bright afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda, behind counter
**Description:** Andrés stacks the empty plate, glass, and utensils back on the tray and covers them with the cloth. He'll take them upstairs later. He wipes the small table with a cloth and tucks the stool back under the counter. He stretches, arms overhead, rolling his shoulders — the morning's work already in his muscles. The tienda is quiet in the early afternoon; the busiest hours are dawn and dusk. He takes a deep breath and settles back into his position behind the counter.

### Scene 068: Afternoon Drowsiness
**Time:** 2:00 PM — bright but heavy afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, medium shot
**Description:** The afternoon heat settles over the tienda. Andrés sits on the wooden stool behind the counter, elbows on the glass surface, chin resting in one hand. His eyelids are heavy — the post-lunch drowsiness that every tienda owner knows. The ceiling fan turns overhead, stirring warm air. The street outside is quiet — siesta time in the neighborhood. A cat sleeps on the sidewalk outside the entrance. The radio plays softly. Andrés's head dips forward, then he catches himself and sits up straight, blinking hard. He rubs his face to stay alert.

### Scene 069: Nodding Off Briefly
**Time:** 2:15 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés's face as his eyes close fully for a moment, chin dropping to his chest. His breathing slows. The ceiling fan's rhythm is hypnotic. His hands rest loosely on the glass counter. A few seconds pass in stillness. Then the bell on the entrance door jingles — a customer entering — and Andrés's eyes snap open immediately. He straightens up, smooths his polo shirt, and greets the customer with a practiced "¡Buenas tardes!" as if he'd been wide awake the entire time. Years of practice.

### Scene 070: Selling Aguapanela
**Time:** 2:30 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A construction worker, dusty and sweating, comes in and asks for a cold aguapanela. Andrés pulls a plastic bottle of homemade aguapanela (sugarcane water with lime) from the refrigerator — Lucía prepares these each morning and they sell well in the heat. The drink is golden-brown, refreshing and sweet. The worker drains half the bottle in one long pull, wiping his mouth with his arm. "Qué rica," he says. Andrés nods proudly — Lucía's recipe is popular. The 1,500-peso sale goes into the register.

### Scene 071: Mateo Arriving from School
**Time:** 3:30 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, from inside
**Description:** Twelve-year-old Mateo appears at the tienda entrance, school backpack slung over one shoulder. He wears the Colombian school uniform — a white short-sleeved shirt, dark blue pants, and black shoes, now slightly scuffed. His dark hair is tousled from the walk home. "¡Hola, Pa!" he calls. Andrés's face lights up — the smile reaching his eyes. He comes from behind the counter to ruffle Mateo's hair. "¿Cómo te fue, mijo?" he asks. Mateo is already heading for the snack display, eyeing the chocoramos.

### Scene 072: Mateo Grabbing a Snack
**Time:** 3:32 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, snack display area
**Description:** Mateo drops his heavy backpack on the floor near the counter with a thud and reaches for a chocoramo from the display. He tears open the foil wrapper and takes a big bite of the chocolate-covered cake, cheeks bulging. His school shirt has come untucked. Andrés shakes his head in mock disapproval but smiles. "Suba a cambiarse y hacer las tareas primero," he tells his son — go upstairs, change, do your homework first. Mateo nods while chewing, grabs his backpack, and heads toward the back door and the stairs to the apartment.

### Scene 073: Mateo Returning to Help
**Time:** 4:15 PM — warm golden afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, from front
**Description:** Mateo returns downstairs, now in a casual t-shirt with the Atlético Nacional soccer logo and shorts. He takes his place beside his father behind the counter, standing on a small wooden step so he can see over it properly. His homework notebook sits on the counter — math problems half-finished, to be completed later. Andrés nods approvingly. Teaching Mateo the business is important — this tienda may be his someday. "Atiende a la señora," Andrés says, gesturing to an approaching customer.

### Scene 074: Mateo Making His First Sale
**Time:** 4:20 PM — warm golden light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up on Mateo and customer
**Description:** A neighborhood woman approaches and Mateo, with exaggerated formality, asks what she needs. "Dos libras de arroz, por favor," she says, hiding a smile at the boy's seriousness. Mateo scoops rice from a large sack into a plastic bag, places it on the scale, and reads the weight carefully. He announces the price — 3,800 pesos — and the woman pays. Mateo opens the register with the key his father showed him, makes change slowly, counting each bill aloud. Andrés watches from a step back, arms crossed, nodding with pride at each correct move.

### Scene 075: Teaching Mateo to Count Change
**Time:** 4:22 PM — warm golden light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up on hands and register
**Description:** Close-up of Mateo's smaller hands working the cash register drawer. He pulls out a 5,000-peso bill and a 200-peso coin to make change for a 10,000-peso note. His father's hand appears briefly, pointing — "No, mijo, she gave you ten, the total was three-eight, so the change is..." Mateo's brow furrows in concentration, then clears. "¡Seis mil doscientos!" He counts it back to the customer. Andrés claps his shoulder. The register drawer is a map of denominations — bills on the left, coins in the small round slots on the right.

### Scene 076: Afternoon Customers — Selling Milk and Bread
**Time:** 4:45 PM — golden afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A steady flow of afternoon customers arrives — people picking up items on the way home. An elderly man buys a liter of milk in a plastic bag (leche en bolsa, the Colombian style) and two pan de bono from the display case. Andrés serves him while Mateo bags the milk carefully. The milk bag is floppy and tricky to handle — Mateo holds it with both hands. The bread display is running low now, only a few rolls remaining from the morning delivery. The late afternoon light casts long amber shadows through the entrance.

### Scene 077: Selling Single Cigarettes
**Time:** 5:00 PM — golden late afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up
**Description:** A young man asks for a single cigarette — another common tienda practice, selling individual items from opened packs. Andrés reaches under the counter to a small tray where he keeps opened cigarette packs and pulls out one cigarette, placing it on the counter. Five hundred pesos. The young man lights it right at the entrance, leaning against the doorframe, chatting with a friend. Smoke curls up past the painted sign above. Andrés keeps a box of matches on the counter as well — sometimes customers need those too.

### Scene 078: Rush Beginning — Multiple Customers
**Time:** 5:15 PM — golden light transitioning to amber
**Setting:** Tienda interior, wider shot
**Description:** The after-work rush begins in earnest. Three customers browse the aisles simultaneously while two more wait at the counter. Andrés moves with practiced efficiency — serving one customer rice and beans, pulling a cold drink from the fridge for another, directing a third to the cleaning supplies aisle. Mateo helps bag items. The tienda fills with chatter and the clinking of bottles. The cash register beeps repeatedly. This is the busiest time — everyone stops at the tienda on the way home from work to pick up what they need for dinner.

### Scene 079: Selling Dinner Ingredients
**Time:** 5:30 PM — warm amber late-afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A woman buys her dinner ingredients — two tomatoes, an onion, a green pepper, a clove of garlic, a bag of lentils, and a small bottle of cooking oil. Andrés weighs the produce, totals the items on his notepad, and bags them. He recommends the fresh cilantro from the crate outside — "está bien fresquito" — and she adds a bunch. These small transactions, repeated dozens of times daily, are the lifeblood of the business. Each customer leaves with exactly what they need, no more, no less — the tienda's purpose fulfilled.

### Scene 080: Mateo Stocking Shelves Under Direction
**Time:** 5:45 PM — amber evening light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, at shelves
**Description:** While Andrés handles the counter during the rush, Mateo restocks shelves from boxes on the floor. The boy reads labels and places items carefully — cans of tuna in one section, bags of pasta in another. He asks his father about a product he doesn't recognize — "¿Pa, esto dónde va?" — holding up a bag of dried corn. Andrés calls back over his shoulder while making change for a customer. Mateo finds the right spot and slides it in. Father and son working together — the tienda as classroom and workplace both.

---

## PART 5: EVENING AT THE TIENDA (6:00 PM - 9:10 PM)

### Scene 081: Selling Lottery Tickets
**Time:** 6:00 PM — warm early evening light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** An older regular customer leans on the counter, chatting with Andrés. "Deme un chancecito, Don Andrés," he says — give me a little chance ticket. Andrés pulls out a small booklet of lottery chance tickets from under the counter, each printed with four-digit numbers. The customer studies the numbers, pointing to one — his lucky combination. Andrés tears it out, writes the sale in a small logbook, and takes the 2,000 pesos. "¡Que le caiga, compadre!" — May you win! — Andrés says. The lottery dream is a daily ritual for many customers.

### Scene 082: Sending Mateo Upstairs
**Time:** 6:15 PM — fading evening light
**Setting:** Tienda, near back door
**Description:** Andrés tells Mateo it's time to go upstairs — "Suba, termine las tareas y ayude a su mamá." Finish your homework and help your mother. Mateo gathers his math notebook from the counter, tucks it under his arm, and heads through the back door toward the stairs. He pauses to grab one more bon bon bum lollipop, and Andrés pretends not to notice. The boy's footsteps thump up the interior stairs, fading. Andrés returns to the counter, now on his own for the evening shift. The store feels slightly emptier without his son's energy.

### Scene 083: Selling Cold Beers — Evening Crowd
**Time:** 7:00 PM — dim evening light outside, fluorescent inside
**Setting:** Tienda, refrigerated case and counter
**Description:** Evening brings a different clientele. Two men in their thirties approach asking for beers. Andrés opens the refrigerated case and pulls out three bottles of Aguila beer — Colombia's most popular lager — condensation clinging to the amber glass. He pops the caps with the wall-mounted opener, three quick metallic pops. The men take their bottles and drift to the sidewalk outside, standing in the warm evening air, talking and drinking. A few more customers follow — Poker beer, another Aguila. The evening beer sales are a steady contributor to the day's total.

### Scene 084: Neighbors Gathering at the Tienda
**Time:** 7:15 PM — dark outside, fluorescent inside, street lights on
**Setting:** Tienda entrance/sidewalk, viewed from inside
**Description:** Viewed from inside the tienda looking out through the entrance, several neighborhood men have gathered on the sidewalk in plastic chairs — some brought their own, Andrés keeps two near the entrance for regulars. They sit with beer bottles and cigarettes, talking animatedly about the latest Atlético Nacional soccer match. Their voices rise and fall in passionate debate. Street lights have come on, casting orange pools on the pavement. A motorcycle rumbles past. This is the tienda's social role — not just a store but a neighborhood living room.

### Scene 085: Andrés Joining the Sidewalk Conversation
**Time:** 7:30 PM — night, street lights, warm evening
**Setting:** Tienda entrance/sidewalk, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés steps out from behind the counter, leaning against the entrance doorframe with his own cup of tinto, joining the conversation. He laughs at a neighbor's joke about the Nacional goalkeeper. His polo shirt is slightly rumpled after the long day, sleeves pushed up to his elbows. He gestures with his coffee cup, arguing a point about the midfield. A customer enters and he slips back inside to serve them — a quick transaction — then returns to the doorframe. This fluid movement between merchant and neighbor is his nightly routine. The warm Medellín evening wraps around the group.

### Scene 086: Selling Evening Groceries
**Time:** 7:45 PM — night, fluorescent interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A man in a hurry enters — he needs eggs, bread, and milk before everything closes. Andrés is back behind the counter instantly, pulling eggs from the carton ("¿Cuántos?"), bagging two remaining pan de bono from the nearly empty display case, and grabbing a milk bag from the fridge. The man pays and rushes off. Andrés notes the low bread supply — tomorrow he'll order extra. The display case has only crumbs now. He wipes it out with a cloth, already thinking about tomorrow's arrangement.

### Scene 087: Counting the Day's Earnings — Bills
**Time:** 8:00 PM — fluorescent interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, from behind
**Description:** During a quiet stretch, Andrés opens the cash register and begins counting the day's earnings. He pulls out stacks of bills — 1,000-peso (blue), 2,000-peso (yellow), 5,000-peso (brown), 10,000-peso (red), and a few 20,000-peso (orange) notes. He sorts them by denomination on the glass counter, creating neat piles. His fingers move quickly through the bills, flicking and counting with practiced speed. A small notebook lies open beside the register where he'll record the total. The radio plays softly in the background — a salsa song now.

### Scene 088: Counting Coins and Recording Total
**Time:** 8:10 PM — fluorescent interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, close-up on hands
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés's hands sorting coins from the register into small piles on the counter — stacks of ten 200-peso coins, stacks of ten 500-peso coins. He counts each stack, lips moving silently, then uses a simple calculator to add the coin total to the bill total. He writes the final number in his notebook — today's gross sales — and draws a circle around it. Below, he subtracts the day's expenses: bakery delivery, produce delivery, the starting float. The net number is modest but steady. He nods, satisfied. A good day.

### Scene 089: Putting Cash in Lockbox
**Time:** 8:15 PM — fluorescent interior light
**Setting:** Tienda, behind counter, close-up
**Description:** Andrés places the day's profit — separated from the starting float which goes back in the register — into a small metal lockbox he keeps under the counter. He leaves enough small bills and coins in the register for tomorrow's starting float. The lockbox is gray metal with a key lock; he'll take it upstairs tonight and deposit at the bank later in the week. He locks it and tucks it under his arm. The register drawer closes with its familiar click — the day's financial life concluded in neat rows of numbers.

### Scene 090: Last Customers Trickling In
**Time:** 8:30 PM — night, fluorescent light, street quiet
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A neighbor's teenage daughter rushes in — "¡Don Andrés, mi mamá necesita sal!" — her mother needs salt for dinner. Andrés pulls a bag of table salt from the shelf and hands it over. She pays the 1,200 pesos with exact change from her palm. These last-minute runs are common — the tienda is the neighborhood's pantry. A few minutes later, a man buys a single beer for the walk home. The customer flow has slowed to a trickle. The sidewalk gathering has dispersed — plastic chairs folded and taken home.

### Scene 091: Pulling in the Fruit Crates
**Time:** 8:45 PM — night, street lights
**Setting:** Tienda entrance/sidewalk
**Description:** Andrés steps outside and carries the two fruit crates back inside the tienda. The bananas are partially picked over — a few singles remain. The mangoes and avocados are lower but some still left. He stacks the crates just inside the entrance, against the wall. The sidewalk is now empty, the neighborhood settling into evening quiet. Distant sounds of TVs from apartment windows, a dog barking, cumbia music from someone's radio. Andrés pauses at the entrance, hands on hips, looking down the street one last time before closing.

### Scene 092: Rolling Down the Security Shutters
**Time:** 9:00 PM — night, street lights, fluorescent interior
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, viewed from inside
**Description:** Andrés unlatches the security shutters from their open position and begins rolling them down. The heavy corrugated steel descends with its signature clanking rattle — the sound of closing time, echoing down the quiet street. The view of the street narrows as the shutters lower: street lights, parked motorcycles, the building across the way, all disappearing behind green-painted steel. The shutters reach the ground with a final clang. Andrés crouches and secures the padlock through the floor bolt. The tienda is sealed for the night.

### Scene 093: Locking the Padlock
**Time:** 9:01 PM — fluorescent interior light, shutters closed
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, low angle close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés's hands clicking the padlock shut through the bolt at the base of the security shutters. The padlock is heavy brass, weathered but strong. He gives it a firm tug to make sure it's secure — this is his livelihood behind these shutters. He straightens up, the sealed shutters stretching floor to ceiling in front of him. The tienda is now a closed box, the fluorescent lights still humming overhead. The street sounds are muffled behind the steel.

### Scene 094: Turning Off the Main Lights
**Time:** 9:03 PM — dark tienda, refrigerator glow
**Setting:** Tienda interior, wide shot from entrance
**Description:** Andrés walks to the back of the tienda and flips the main light switch off. The fluorescent tubes flicker and die, plunging the store into near-darkness. The only light now is the cool blue-white glow from the refrigerated display case, which runs all night to keep drinks and perishables cold. Its hum fills the silent store. The shelves are dark silhouettes, products barely visible. Andrés picks up the metal lockbox from the counter, his shape outlined by the refrigerator's glow. He checks the back door lock one more time.

### Scene 095: Climbing Stairs to the Apartment
**Time:** 9:07 PM — dim stairway
**Setting:** Interior stairway, viewed from below
**Description:** Andrés climbs the narrow stairs from the tienda to his apartment, the metal lockbox tucked under one arm, keys jangling in the other hand. His leather shoes are heavy on the concrete steps — his legs ache after sixteen hours of standing, pacing, crouching, lifting. The stairway is dim, lit by a single bulb at the top. He grips the metal railing, pulling himself upward. At the top, the apartment door is cracked open, warm light and the sound of his family filtering through.

## PART 6: EVENING AT HOME (9:10 PM - 10:25 PM)

### Scene 096: Entering the Apartment
**Time:** 9:10 PM — warm apartment light
**Setting:** Apartment living room, viewed from entrance
**Description:** Andrés pushes open the apartment door and steps into the warm living room. Lucía sits on the brown couch watching a telenovela on the TV, legs tucked beneath her. Mateo lies on the floor with a tablet, earbuds in, watching something on his screen. The living room is modest — the couch, a wooden coffee table, the TV on a stand, a few family photos on the wall, a potted plant in the corner. A small desk against one wall holds a notebook and calculator — the household's business station. "Llegué, mi amor," Andrés announces. Lucía smiles. Home.

### Scene 097: Setting Down the Lockbox
**Time:** 9:11 PM — warm apartment light
**Setting:** Apartment living room, at desk
**Description:** Andrés walks to the small desk and sets the metal lockbox down, locking it in the bottom drawer. He places his keys on a hook by the desk. He takes off his watch and sets it beside the lockbox. The drawer contains previous days' earnings waiting for the weekly bank deposit. He pushes the drawer shut and turns the key. The day's money is secure. He straightens up, rolling his neck, feeling the tension of the long day in his shoulders.

### Scene 098: Changing into Home Clothes
**Time:** 9:14 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés enters the bedroom and peels off his navy polo shirt, dropping it into a laundry basket. The shirt is slightly wrinkled and carries the day's scents — coffee, cardboard, cleaning products. He pulls on a loose white cotton t-shirt and a pair of comfortable shorts. He kicks off the leather shoes with a relieved sigh and slides into rubber chanclas. The transformation from shopkeeper to home is immediate — his posture relaxes, shoulders dropping. The bed looks inviting but dinner comes first. The ceiling fan turns above, stirring the warm night air.

### Scene 099: Greeting Mateo
**Time:** 9:17 PM — warm living room light
**Setting:** Apartment living room, at couch
**Description:** Andrés drops onto the couch beside Lucía and reaches down to ruffle Mateo's hair on the floor. "¿Terminaste las tareas?" — Did you finish your homework? Mateo nods, not looking up from the tablet, engrossed in a video. Andrés gently pulls out one earbud and asks again. "Sí, Pa, ya terminé," Mateo confirms. Andrés takes the homework notebook from the coffee table and flips through it — the math problems are done, handwriting messy but the answers mostly correct. He nods, satisfied, and hands it back. "Bien, mijo."

### Scene 100: Sitting Down to Dinner
**Time:** 9:20 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment dining area, wide shot
**Description:** The family moves to the small wooden dining table in the area adjacent to the kitchen. Lucía has warmed Andrés's dinner and set out a plate — tonight it's sopa de frijoles (bean soup) with a side of white rice and a small piece of carne asada. A basket of arepas sits in the center of the table. Mateo already ate earlier but sits at the table with a glass of juice, keeping his parents company. Andrés pulls out his chair, sits heavily, and surveys the meal with genuine appreciation. "Huele delicioso," he says. It smells wonderful.

### Scene 101: Eating Bean Soup
**Time:** 9:23 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment dining area, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés spooning the thick bean soup into his mouth. The sopa de frijoles is rich — red beans in a creamy broth with chunks of potato, plantain, and a piece of pork. He tears a piece of arepa and dips it into the soup, soaking up the broth. Steam rises from the bowl. Lucía sits across from him, sipping herbal tea, telling him about her day — a phone call from her mother, Mateo's homework struggles, a plumbing issue in the bathroom. Andrés listens, chewing, nodding, offering solutions between spoonfuls.

### Scene 102: Family Conversation at the Table
**Time:** 9:30 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment dining area, medium shot of three
**Description:** The three of them sit around the table — Andrés eating, Lucía talking, Mateo interjecting. Mateo tells his father about a soccer match at school recess — "Pa, metí un gol hoy!" — he scored a goal. Andrés's eyes light up. "¡Eso es, mijo! ¿Quién iba a ganar?" The conversation flows between school stories, tienda business, family gossip. This is the only time all three are together and unhurried. The kitchen light casts a warm yellow glow on their faces. The painted tiles on the backsplash add color to the background. A simple scene of family connection.

### Scene 103: Clearing the Dinner Table
**Time:** 9:38 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Andrés carries his empty bowl and plate to the kitchen sink. Lucía brings the remaining dishes. They work together briefly — she washes, he dries, putting plates in the rack on the counter. Mateo has drifted back to the couch and his tablet. The kitchen is small enough that they stand shoulder to shoulder at the sink. Andrés dries the last bowl, hangs the towel on the oven handle, and wraps his arm around Lucía's waist for a brief moment. "Gracias por la comida, mi amor." She leans into him.

### Scene 104: Watching Telenovela on the Couch
**Time:** 9:42 PM — dim living room, TV glow
**Setting:** Apartment living room, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés settles into the couch beside Lucía, both facing the TV. A Colombian telenovela plays — dramatic close-ups, sweeping music, an argument between two characters in an opulent setting. Lucía is absorbed, leaning forward at the dramatic moments. Andrés watches with less intensity, his eyelids already heavy. Mateo sits on the floor, still on his tablet with earbuds. The living room is bathed in the blue-white flicker of the TV screen. Andrés's feet rest on the wooden coffee table in his chanclas — a small rebellion Lucía tolerates.

### Scene 105: Checking WhatsApp Messages
**Time:** 9:50 PM — TV light and phone glow
**Setting:** Apartment living room, close-up
**Description:** Andrés pulls out his phone and scrolls through WhatsApp messages. A supplier has sent tomorrow's price list — eggs are up 200 pesos per carton. A neighbor asks if he'll have fresh bread early. His brother in Bogotá sends a funny meme about tienda owners. He replies to the supplier with a thumbs up, confirms bread for the neighbor, and sends a laughing emoji to his brother. The phone screen glows in his face, blue against the TV's flickering light. Lucía glances over disapprovingly — "No más teléfono, descansa" — no more phone, rest.

### Scene 106: Reviewing Accounts at the Desk
**Time:** 10:00 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Apartment living room, at desk
**Description:** Andrés moves to the small desk and opens his accounts notebook under the desk lamp. The lamp casts a warm circle of light on the cluttered surface — the notebook, a basic calculator, receipts from the week, a pen. He reviews the week's numbers: Monday through today's sales, expenses, supplier payments. He enters today's total and calculates the running weekly figure. The numbers are modest but consistent. He makes notes in the margin — order more cooking oil, egg prices rising, consider new snack brands. The calculator's buttons click softly. Lucía has turned off the TV; the apartment is quiet.

### Scene 107: Closing the Notebook
**Time:** 10:10 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Apartment living room, at desk, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés closing the accounts notebook and capping the pen. His hands rest on the closed cover for a moment — this notebook represents everything: the tienda's health, the family's security, Mateo's future. He clicks off the desk lamp. The room goes dark except for the hallway light. He stands, pushes the chair back, and stretches — arms overhead, back arching, a full-body release of the day's accumulated tension. His joints crack. Tomorrow is another day of the same rhythm, and he's ready for it.

### Scene 108: Telling Mateo to Go to Bed
**Time:** 10:12 PM — warm hallway light
**Setting:** Apartment living room/hallway
**Description:** Andrés finds Mateo still on the tablet, lying on the couch where Lucía was. "A dormir, mijo, que mañana hay colegio." — Time for bed, you have school tomorrow. Mateo groans the universal protest of twelve-year-olds but puts the tablet down. He shuffles to his room, pausing to hug his father goodnight — a quick, slightly embarrassed embrace. "Buenas noches, Pa." Andrés watches him disappear through his bedroom door, the one with the Nacional sticker. He waits until the light goes off under the door, then heads to the bathroom.

### Scene 109: Brushing Teeth Before Bed
**Time:** 10:15 PM — harsh fluorescent bathroom light
**Setting:** Andrés's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Andrés stands at the bathroom sink brushing his teeth, the fluorescent light harsh after the dimmer living room. He meets his own tired gaze in the round mirror — eyes slightly bloodshot from the long day, dark circles forming beneath, but the mustache still neat. His white t-shirt hangs loosely. He brushes methodically, spits, rinses, and splashes water on his face one more time. The bathroom is quiet except for the running faucet and the distant hum of the refrigerator downstairs through the floor. He dries his face on the towel.

### Scene 110: Getting Into Bed
**Time:** 10:20 PM — dark bedroom, faint street light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés enters the dark bedroom where Lucía is already in bed, reading a magazine by the light of her phone. He kicks off his chanclas, pulls back the thin sheet, and slides into bed with a groan of relief. The mattress sags comfortably under his weight. The ceiling fan turns above, stirring the warm night air. Through the curtains, faint orange street light casts a glow on the ceiling. "¿Qué tal el día?" Lucía asks softly. "Bien, gracias a Dios," he says. Good, thank God. He rolls onto his side toward her.

### Scene 111: Setting the Alarm
**Time:** 10:22 PM — phone screen glow
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés's hand holding his phone, setting the alarm for 5:00 AM. The screen shows seven hours until the alarm — a countdown to the start of the same routine again. He places the phone face-down on the wooden nightstand, beside the glass of water and the family photo. The phone's edge glows briefly then dims. Lucía has put down her magazine and turned off her phone. The room is dark now. The ceiling fan whispers overhead.

### Scene 112: Saying a Quick Prayer
**Time:** 10:23 PM — near-total darkness
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, lying in bed
**Description:** Andrés lies on his back, eyes closed, hands folded on his chest. His lips move in a brief silent prayer — thanking God for a good day, for the tienda's sales, for his family's health, asking for protection through the night and strength for tomorrow. The small picture of the Virgin Mary above the bed is a dark shape on the wall. Lucía's breathing beside him has already slowed toward sleep. The prayer is brief but sincere — the same words every night, a bookend to the prayer he will offer in the morning.

### Scene 113: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 10:25 PM — darkness
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, wide shot from foot of bed
**Description:** The bedroom is still and dark. Andrés lies beside Lucía, both asleep now. His breathing is deep and even, the mustache fluttering slightly with each exhale. One arm rests across his stomach, the other stretched toward his wife. The ceiling fan turns in its endless slow circle. Through the curtains, the faint orange glow of street lights and the distant murmur of the Medellín night — a motorcycle far away, music from a distant bar, the hum of the city that never fully sleeps. But above the tienda, in the small apartment, the Gómez family rests. In six hours and thirty-five minutes, the phone alarm will sound, and Andrés will do it all again.

## PART 7: SPECIAL SCENES — SUNDAYS AND ERRANDS

### Scene 114: Sunday — Sleeping In
**Time:** 7:00 AM (Sunday) — bright morning light through curtains
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, side view
**Description:** Sunday morning. The tienda stays closed until the afternoon on Sundays, and the alarm did not go off at five. Andrés lies in bed, still asleep at seven — a luxury. Morning light filters through the curtains, casting warm yellow stripes across the bed. His face is relaxed, the tension of the workweek absent. Lucía's side of the bed is empty — she's already up, the sheet pulled back. From the kitchen, the distant sounds of breakfast preparation: a pot clinking, the hiss of the stove. The ceiling fan turns lazily. No rush, no customers waiting.

### Scene 115: Sunday — Stretching Awake
**Time:** 7:15 AM (Sunday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, medium shot
**Description:** Andrés stretches luxuriously in bed, arms reaching above his head, legs extending to the foot of the mattress. He yawns enormously, mustache stretching wide. He blinks at the sunlit curtains, momentarily disoriented by the late hour. The smell of coffee and something frying reaches him from the kitchen — Lucía's Sunday breakfast preparations. He sits up slowly, no urgency for once, rubbing his face and running a hand through his mussed hair. The pillow still holds the indent of his head. He swings his feet to the floor and finds his chanclas by feel.

### Scene 116: Sunday — Family Breakfast Together
**Time:** 8:00 AM (Sunday) — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment dining area, wide shot
**Description:** The family sits together at the small wooden dining table for Sunday breakfast — the one meal all week where no one is rushed. Lucía has prepared huevos pericos (scrambled eggs with tomato and green onion), arepas, and cups of hot aguapanela (sugarcane water with lime, served warm). Mateo, still in pajamas, eats drowsily, hair sticking up. Andrés is in his t-shirt and shorts, the most relaxed version of himself. He butters an arepa, takes a bite, closes his eyes with pleasure. "¿Vamos a misa de diez?" Lucía asks — Are we going to ten o'clock mass? Andrés nods.

### Scene 117: Sunday — Eating Huevos Pericos
**Time:** 8:05 AM (Sunday) — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment dining area, close-up on food
**Description:** Close-up of the Sunday breakfast spread on the table. A plate of huevos pericos — fluffy scrambled eggs flecked with diced red tomato and chopped green onion, slightly golden from the pan. A basket of warm arepas wrapped in a cloth. Three ceramic mugs of aguapanela — golden-brown sugarcane water, the traditional Colombian alternative to coffee or tea, sweet and warming. A small dish of queso fresco sits in the center, white and crumbly. Andrés's fork pushes eggs onto a piece of arepa, scooping them together for a perfect bite. A simple feast.

### Scene 118: Sunday — Getting Dressed for Church
**Time:** 9:15 AM (Sunday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Andrés's bedroom, at wardrobe
**Description:** Andrés stands at the open wardrobe, choosing his church clothes. He selects his one button-down shirt — a light blue dress shirt, ironed by Lucía — and a pair of darker pants, slightly more formal than his daily jeans. He puts them on carefully, tucking the shirt in, fastening the belt. No polo today. He examines himself in the small mirror on the wardrobe door, adjusting the collar. He combs his hair neatly with a plastic comb. His leather shoes, polished, wait on the wardrobe floor. Sunday means looking his best for God and the community.

### Scene 119: Sunday — Walking to Church as a Family
**Time:** 9:45 AM (Sunday) — bright warm morning
**Setting:** Neighborhood street, medium shot
**Description:** The Gómez family walks together down the tree-lined Laureles neighborhood street toward the church. Andrés in his blue shirt and dark pants, Lucía in a modest floral dress with a light cardigan, Mateo in a clean white polo and khaki pants — his least favorite outfit, judging by his expression. They walk close together, Andrés's hand on Mateo's shoulder. Other families walk the same direction — it's a neighborhood procession. Flowering trees line the street, dropping pink petals on the sidewalk. The church bell sounds distantly, calling the faithful.

### Scene 120: Sunday — Entering the Church
**Time:** 10:00 AM (Sunday) — muted interior light, stained glass colors
**Setting:** Church interior, entrance looking toward altar
**Description:** The family enters the neighborhood Catholic church through tall wooden doors. The interior is cool and dim after the bright street — high ceilings, rows of dark wooden pews, a central aisle leading to the altar. Stained glass windows along the walls filter sunlight into pools of red, blue, gold, and green on the stone floor. A large crucifix hangs above the altar. The church smells of old wood, candle wax, and incense. Other families file in, finding their usual seats. Andrés dips his fingers in the holy water font at the entrance, crosses himself, and guides his family to their pew — third from the back on the left side, same as always.

### Scene 121: Sunday — Sitting in the Pew
**Time:** 10:05 AM (Sunday) — muted stained glass light
**Setting:** Church interior, in pew
**Description:** The family sits in the wooden pew — Andrés on the aisle, then Lucía, then Mateo. Andrés kneels briefly, hands clasped, eyes closed in a moment of personal prayer before mass begins. The pew's wood is smooth and worn from decades of congregants. A hymnal and a prayer book sit in the rack on the pew back in front of them. Mateo fidgets, looking at the stained glass, while Lucía arranges her cardigan. Andrés settles back, sitting upright, hands on his thighs. The priest emerges from the sacristy in white vestments. The organ begins to play.

### Scene 122: Sunday — Praying During Mass
**Time:** 10:30 AM (Sunday) — stained glass light, candle glow
**Setting:** Church interior, close-up in pew
**Description:** Close-up of Andrés during mass — eyes closed, head bowed, hands folded in his lap. His lips move with the familiar prayers, words he has known since childhood. The congregation's murmured responses surround him. Light from a stained glass window paints his blue shirt with patches of gold and red. Lucía holds a small prayer book. Mateo glances sideways at his father's concentrated devotion. These moments of stillness are rare in Andrés's week — the church is the one place where he is not counting change or stacking shelves. Here he is simply a man in conversation with God.

### Scene 123: Market Day — Arriving at Plaza Minorista
**Time:** 6:00 AM (Wednesday) — cool early morning light
**Setting:** Wholesale market exterior, wide shot
**Description:** Andrés arrives at the Plaza Minorista — Medellín's massive wholesale market — in a borrowed pickup truck. The market is enormous: a sprawling complex of open-air and covered stalls under metal roofing, bustling even at this early hour. Vendors shout prices, handcarts roll past loaded with produce, forklifts beep. Andrés parks the truck near the entrance and grabs his inventory list from the dashboard — the clipboard with circled items from his storage room check. He wears his polo shirt and jeans, a baseball cap against the sun, and carries a canvas tote bag. The air smells of fresh fruit, raw fish, coffee, and diesel exhaust.

### Scene 124: Market Day — Buying Produce in Bulk
**Time:** 6:15 AM (Wednesday) — bright market light
**Setting:** Wholesale market interior, produce section
**Description:** Andrés walks through the produce section of the market, a cacophony of color and sound. He stops at his usual vegetable vendor's stall — a man he's known for years. He examines crates of tomatoes, squeezing a few gently; picks through green plantains, checking for firmness; selects a sack of yellow papa criolla potatoes. He negotiates prices, shaking his head at the first offer, countering, settling on a number with a handshake. A helper loads the purchases onto a large wooden handcart. The produce section stretches into the distance — mountains of avocados, pyramids of oranges, bunches of cilantro.

### Scene 125: Market Day — Buying Dry Goods and Drinks
**Time:** 6:40 AM (Wednesday) — bright market light
**Setting:** Wholesale market interior, dry goods section
**Description:** Andrés moves to the dry goods section, the handcart already heavy with produce. He buys cases of Colombiana soda and Coca-Cola — twenty-four bottles each, the glass bottles clinking as the helper stacks them. Cases of Aguila and Poker beer. Large bags of rice (25 kg), bags of sugar, bulk lentils and red beans. Each purchase is noted on his clipboard. He counts the cases carefully — mistakes are expensive. Stacks of inventory surround him on the cart, growing into a small mountain. He checks items off his list methodically.

### Scene 126: Market Day — Loading the Truck
**Time:** 7:15 AM (Wednesday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Market parking area
**Description:** Andrés and the helper wheel the loaded handcart to the parked truck. They lift boxes and sacks into the truck bed — heavy work that makes Andrés grunt with effort. Cases of soda, crates of produce, bags of rice and beans, boxes of canned goods and snacks. The helper arranges them to prevent shifting during the drive. Andrés pays the helper a tip — a folded bill from his pocket. He checks the load one more time, confirming everything on his clipboard is accounted for. The truck bed is packed full, sagging slightly on its springs. He ties a rope across the back for security.

### Scene 127: Market Day — Driving Back to the Tienda
**Time:** 7:30 AM (Wednesday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Truck cab, Medellín streets
**Description:** Andrés drives the loaded truck through Medellín's morning traffic, both hands on the steering wheel. The streets are busy — motorcycles weave between cars, buses hiss at stops, street vendors push carts along the sidewalks. He drives carefully with the heavy load, checking mirrors frequently. The Medellín skyline rises in the distance — modern buildings against green mountains. Through the open window, the sounds of the city pour in: honking, engine noise, distant reggaeton from a shop. His baseball cap shades his eyes from the sun. The tienda's weekly resupply is on its way home.

### Scene 128: Market Day — Unloading at the Tienda
**Time:** 8:00 AM (Wednesday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tienda entrance, from street
**Description:** The truck is parked outside the tienda, shutters already open (Lucía opened early today to help). Andrés and Mateo — late for school but conscripted for the heavy lifting — carry boxes and sacks from the truck into the store. Andrés hauls a 25-kilogram rice sack on his shoulder, face straining with the weight. Mateo carries a lighter box of snacks, walking with exaggerated effort. Lucía directs traffic from inside — "Las gaseosas al fondo, el arroz en la bodega." Neighbors walking past observe the familiar market-day scene. The tienda's weekly lifeblood is being transfused.

### Scene 129: Weekend — Watching Mateo's Soccer Game
**Time:** 4:00 PM (Saturday) — warm golden afternoon light
**Setting:** Neighborhood soccer field, sideline
**Description:** Andrés stands on the sideline of a neighborhood soccer field — a flat grassy area with improvised goals made from metal pipes. Mateo is on the field in a green jersey, playing midfielder in a neighborhood youth match. Andrés cups his hands around his mouth and shouts encouragement: "¡Dale, Mateo! ¡Pásala!" Other parents line the sideline — mothers with umbrellas for shade, fathers with arms crossed, everyone shouting. Andrés has left the tienda in Lucía's hands for the afternoon — rare, but his son's games are non-negotiable. The Medellín sun warms his face. He claps vigorously when Mateo makes a good pass.

### Scene 130: Weekend — Cheering a Goal
**Time:** 4:25 PM (Saturday) — warm golden light
**Setting:** Neighborhood soccer field, sideline, close-up
**Description:** Mateo receives a pass, dribbles past a defender, and shoots — the ball sails into the goal past the diving keeper. Andrés erupts, arms in the air, shouting "¡GOOOOOL! ¡Ese es mi hijo!" His face is pure joy, mustache stretched wide in an ecstatic grin. He turns to the other parents, high-fiving the father beside him. On the field, Mateo runs with his arms spread out, teammates mobbing him. Andrés's chest swells with a pride that has nothing to do with tienda sales or inventory counts. This is the good stuff. This is what the sixteen-hour days are for.

### Scene 131: Weekend — Evening Walk in the Park
**Time:** 7:00 PM (Saturday) — soft golden evening light
**Setting:** Neighborhood park, walking path
**Description:** The Gómez family strolls through a neighborhood park in the pleasant Medellín evening. The park has paved walking paths under mature trees, benches, and a central fountain. Other families are out too — couples holding hands, children chasing each other, elderly men playing chess on stone tables. Andrés walks with his arm around Lucía's shoulder, Mateo a few steps ahead kicking a small ball. The air is perfect — Medellín's eternal spring means evenings are always comfortable. Street lamps begin to flicker on as the golden light fades. An ice cream vendor pushes a white cart, bell ringing.

### Scene 132: Weekend — Buying Ice Cream
**Time:** 7:10 PM (Saturday) — soft golden-to-dusk light
**Setting:** Neighborhood park, at ice cream cart
**Description:** Mateo runs back to his parents pointing at the ice cream vendor's cart. Andrés smiles and waves the vendor over. The white cart has a rainbow-striped umbrella and hand-painted pictures of ice cream flavors. Andrés orders three cones — chocolate for Mateo, mora (blackberry) for Lucía, and lulo (a tangy Colombian fruit) for himself. The vendor scoops bright purple, dark brown, and pale green spheres onto wafer cones. Andrés pays from loose bills in his pocket. The family continues walking, each licking their ice cream, Mateo's already dripping down his wrist.

### Scene 133: Weekend — Sitting on a Park Bench
**Time:** 7:20 PM (Saturday) — dusk, park lights on
**Setting:** Neighborhood park, on bench
**Description:** The family sits on a green-painted metal park bench beneath a tree. Andrés leans back, legs stretched out, finishing his ice cream cone. Lucía sits beside him, dabbing Mateo's sticky hands with a tissue. The park lights are on now, casting pools of white light along the paths. The fountain splashes nearby, water catching the light. Mateo has already spotted friends from school and looks pleadingly at his father. "Vaya, pero donde yo lo pueda ver," Andrés says — go, but where I can see you. Mateo sprints off. Andrés and Lucía sit in comfortable silence, watching their son disappear into a group of laughing children.

---

## PART 8: ADDITIONAL DAILY SCENES

### Scene 134: Receiving a Money Transfer (Giro)
**Time:** 11:00 AM (weekday) — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** A woman asks Andrés to receive a money transfer (giro) for her — many tiendas offer basic financial services for customers without bank accounts. Andrés opens an app on his phone, enters the transaction code the woman provides, and confirms the amount. He counts out bills from the register and hands them to her, minus a small service fee. She thanks him gratefully — this saves her a trip to the bank or a remittance office downtown. Andrés notes the transaction in his logbook. The tienda is more than a store — it's a neighborhood bank, social club, and information hub.

### Scene 135: Power Outage During the Day
**Time:** 2:00 PM (weekday) — natural light only, dim interior
**Setting:** Tienda interior, dimly lit
**Description:** The fluorescent lights go out suddenly — a power outage, common enough in Medellín. The tienda plunges into dimness, lit only by daylight from the open entrance. The refrigerator falls silent, its constant hum absent for the first time all day. Andrés doesn't panic — he continues serving a customer by the entrance light, making change by feel from the register. He glances at the refrigerated case with concern — the drinks and perishables will be fine for an hour, but longer than that... He pulls out a battery-powered lantern from under the counter and sets it on the glass surface, its white LED creating a small island of light.

### Scene 136: Cleaning the Tienda Floor — End of Day
**Time:** 8:30 PM (weekday) — fluorescent interior light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, full length
**Description:** Near closing time, Andrés mops the tienda floor — a bucket of soapy water and a string mop, working from back to front. The wet concrete glistens under the fluorescent lights. He pushes the mop in long arcs, navigating between shelf bases and the refrigerator. The water in the bucket turns gray with the day's accumulated grime — dust from shoes, crumbs from snacks, dirt tracked in from the street. The tienda smells of pine cleaner. He wrings the mop methodically, the physical labor a familiar end-of-day ritual.

### Scene 137: Weekly Bank Deposit
**Time:** 10:00 AM (Thursday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bank interior, at teller window
**Description:** Andrés stands at the teller window of a local Bancolombia branch, making the weekly deposit. He slides an envelope of bills — the accumulated daily earnings — across the counter to the teller, a young woman behind bulletproof glass. She counts the bills with a machine, rapid-fire flicking through the denominations. The bank interior is modern — air-conditioned, marble floors, digital screens showing exchange rates. Andrés watches the count, mentally confirming it matches his notebook total. The teller stamps a receipt and slides it back. He folds it carefully into his wallet. The tienda's money is safe.

### Scene 138: Calling His Brother in Bogotá
**Time:** 9:30 PM (weekday) — warm living room light
**Setting:** Apartment living room, on couch
**Description:** Andrés sits on the couch, phone to his ear, talking to his older brother Roberto in Bogotá. They catch up — Roberto's kids are doing well, the Bogotá weather is terrible as always, their mother wants everyone home for Christmas. Andrés laughs, his free hand gesturing as he talks even though his brother can't see. "¿Y el negocio cómo va?" Roberto asks — How's the business? "Bien, gracias a Dios, no me puedo quejar." Good, thanks to God, can't complain. The conversation is warm, punctuated with laughter and family gossip. Lucía sits beside him, half-listening, smiling at the familiar rhythms.

### Scene 139: Helping a Neighbor in Need
**Time:** 6:30 PM (weekday) — warm evening light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, customer interaction
**Description:** An elderly neighbor, Doña Carmen, comes to the tienda looking worried. She needs groceries — rice, beans, eggs, cooking oil — but confesses she's short on money until her pension arrives next week. Andrés doesn't hesitate. He bags the items and writes the amount in a small separate notebook — the "fiado" book, an informal credit system that's been a tienda tradition for generations. "Pague cuando pueda, Doña Carmen," he says — pay when you can. She clasps his hand gratefully. The fiado book has many names in it, mostly reliable. Trust is the currency that keeps a neighborhood tienda running.

### Scene 140: Fixing a Shelf in the Tienda
**Time:** 3:00 PM (weekday) — bright interior light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, mid-aisle
**Description:** A metal shelf bracket has come loose, causing one shelf to sag under the weight of canned goods. Andrés pulls a small toolbox from the storage room — a battered metal box with a hammer, screwdriver set, pliers, and screws. He removes the cans, tightens the bracket screws with a Phillips-head screwdriver, and tests the shelf by pressing down. Satisfied it's secure, he replaces the cans, facing the labels forward again. Small repairs are constant — the tienda is an old space, and everything needs maintenance. He puts the toolbox back, wiping his hands on a rag.

### Scene 141: Lucía Helping at the Counter
**Time:** 5:00 PM (busy weekday) — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, two people behind counter
**Description:** On a particularly busy afternoon, Lucía comes down from the apartment to help at the counter. She and Andrés work side by side — she handles one customer while he serves another. Their movements are coordinated, developed over years of partnership. She knows the prices and the products almost as well as he does. When a customer asks for something from the back shelf, Andrés reaches it while Lucía makes change. They exchange glances and brief words — "¿Cuántos huevos quedan?" / "Como veinte" — a married couple in their element. The tienda was their shared dream, and they built it together.

### Scene 142: Mateo's Homework at the Counter
**Time:** 4:30 PM (weekday) — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, at the end
**Description:** Mateo does his homework at the far end of the tienda counter, school books spread out, pencil scratching on paper. His math textbook is open to fractions. Between customers, Andrés leans over and checks his son's work — "Ese tres va abajo, mijo" — correcting a fraction placement. Mateo erases and rewrites. The counter doubles as a desk, a dining table, and a workspace — every surface in a small tienda serves multiple purposes. A customer approaches and Mateo instinctively slides his books to make room, then pulls them back when the transaction is done.

### Scene 143: Dealing with a Supplier Issue
**Time:** 9:00 AM (weekday) — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tienda counter, on phone
**Description:** Andrés is on the phone with a beer distributor, his expression tense. The delivery that was supposed to come yesterday never arrived, and his beer stock is running low. "Hermano, yo necesito esa entrega hoy," he says firmly — I need that delivery today. He listens, pacing behind the counter, one hand rubbing the back of his neck. The distributor makes excuses. Andrés negotiates a delivery time, writing it down. He hangs up and sighs. Running a small business means constant problem-solving — unreliable suppliers, price increases, missing deliveries. He checks the refrigerator case — enough beer for today, barely.

### Scene 144: End-of-Week Inventory Check
**Time:** 8:00 PM (Friday) — fluorescent interior light
**Setting:** Tienda storage room, full view
**Description:** Andrés conducts his weekly detailed inventory in the storage room, clipboard in hand. He counts boxes and sacks methodically: cases of soda (seven), bags of rice (four), boxes of canned goods (three full, one partial), cleaning supplies (adequate), snack boxes (need restocking). He opens each box, checks quantities against his running list, and notes discrepancies. One box of chips is lighter than expected — possibly Mateo's snacking habits. He smiles, makes a note, and moves to the next shelf. The inventory check takes thirty minutes and determines next week's wholesale market list.

### Scene 145: A Quiet Moment — Pride in the Tienda
**Time:** 6:00 AM (weekday) — fresh morning light
**Setting:** Tienda interior, wide shot from entrance
**Description:** Andrés stands at the open entrance of his tienda in the fresh morning light, surveying his store before the first customer arrives. The shelves are stocked, the floor is clean, the bread display gleams, the coffee thermos is full. The sign above reads "TIENDA DON ANDRÉS" in its hand-painted letters. He built this business from nothing — a small loan, years of early mornings and late nights, Lucía's support, his own stubborn determination. The tienda isn't fancy, isn't large, but it's his. It feeds his family, educates his son, and serves his neighborhood. He takes a deep breath of the cool Medellín morning air and steps behind the counter. The day begins.

### Scene 146: Teaching Mateo About the Business
**Time:** 7:00 PM (weekday) — fluorescent interior light, evening
**Setting:** Tienda counter, father and son
**Description:** During a quiet evening moment, Andrés shows Mateo the accounts notebook. "Mira, mijo — esto es lo que entró hoy, esto es lo que salió," he explains — this is what came in, this is what went out. Mateo looks at the columns of numbers with the half-interested, half-bored expression of a twelve-year-old. But Andrés knows these lessons matter. He shows him how to calculate profit, how to track expenses, why you always put the starting float back first. Mateo nods, understanding more than he lets on. The notebook is a textbook the school doesn't offer — the education of a future business owner, or at least a young man who understands the value of hard work.

### Scene 147: Looking Up at the Apartment Windows
**Time:** 9:05 PM (weekday) — night, from the street
**Setting:** Street in front of tienda, looking up
**Description:** Exterior view from the quiet nighttime street. The tienda's green security shutters are down and padlocked — the store is closed for the night. But above, warm yellow light glows from the apartment windows. Through the sheer curtains, the silhouette of the Gómez family is faintly visible — the flicker of the TV, a figure moving in the kitchen. The "TIENDA DON ANDRÉS" sign is dark but legible in the street light. The building is modest — two stories, painted white with green trim, wedged between similar structures on the neighborhood street. A motorcycle is parked at the curb. The last of the evening's sounds drift away. The tienda sleeps. The family lives above. Tomorrow at five, the alarm will ring, and Andrés will descend the stairs once more.
