# A Day in the Life of Camilo: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Camilo, a 14-year-old Colombian boy living in Barranquilla with his family.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Teenage boy character relatable to young learners and teens
- School vocabulary (classroom, hallway, textbooks, school supplies)
- Soccer/sports vocabulary (cleats, goal, dribble, shin guards, pass, scrimmage)
- Colombian Caribbean coast context (Barranquilla, tropical heat, Caribbean culture)
- Family dynamics (parents, younger sister)
- Objects shown in real-world settings
- Cultural context embedded naturally
- Caribbean Colombian daily life authentically represented

## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — BEDROOM (6:00 AM - 6:25 AM)

### Scene 001: Pre-Dawn Bedroom
**Time:** 6:00 AM — pale gray-blue pre-dawn light through window
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, wide view from doorway
**Description:** A teenage boy's bedroom in a Barranquilla house, quiet and still in the early morning. A 14-year-old Colombian boy with light brown skin and short black slightly wavy hair sleeps on his side in a single bed with a Colombia flag-themed bedsheet — bold stripes of yellow, blue, and red. The room has light blue walls covered with soccer posters: a large poster of Lionel Messi in action, a James Rodriguez Colombia national team poster, and a Junior de Barranquilla team banner in red and white. A small wooden desk sits against one wall with stacked school textbooks, spiral notebooks, and a pencil cup. A shelf above the desk holds five small soccer trophies of varying sizes, two bronze medals on ribbons, and a framed team photograph. A white and black soccer ball rests on the tile floor near the closet door. The ceiling fan turns slowly overhead. Pale gray-blue pre-dawn light seeps through the thin curtains. The room is warm even at this hour — Barranquilla never cools down.

### Scene 002: Phone Alarm Ringing
**Time:** 6:01 AM — soft gray morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** A smartphone on the wooden nightstand buzzes and lights up with an alarm, the screen glowing bright in the dim room. The phone is plugged into a white charging cable that trails to a wall outlet. The alarm display reads 6:00 with a small soccer ball icon. Next to the phone sits a half-empty glass of water and a small digital clock with red numbers. Camilo's hand reaches out from under the Colombia flag bedsheet, fingers fumbling for the phone. His short black hair is slightly mussed from sleep. The Junior de Barranquilla poster on the wall behind the nightstand catches a faint glow from the phone screen.

### Scene 003: Hitting Snooze
**Time:** 6:02 AM — growing gray-blue light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Camilo lies face-down on the pillow, one arm stretched over the edge of the bed, the phone now silenced in his hand. He wears a faded yellow Colombia national team jersey as sleepwear and light cotton shorts. The Colombia flag bedsheet is tangled around his legs. His face is half-buried in the white pillow, eyes squeezed shut. The ceiling fan casts slow-moving shadows across the bed. A pair of worn black soccer cleats sit just inside the bedroom door, the laces loose and muddy from yesterday's practice.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 6:04 AM — soft warm morning light beginning
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, side view of bed
**Description:** Camilo sits up slowly in bed, rubbing both eyes with his fists. His short black hair sticks up on one side from the pillow. He wears the faded Colombia national team jersey — the yellow fabric well-worn and soft. He yawns widely, jaw stretched open, arms pushing back against the mattress. The Colombia flag bedsheet pools around his waist. On the nightstand, the phone screen has lit up again with a second alarm reminder. The Messi poster on the wall above the headboard shows the player mid-kick. Through the thin curtains, the first hints of Caribbean morning light turn the sky pink and gold.

### Scene 005: Feet on the Tile Floor
**Time:** 6:05 AM — warm early morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, low angle close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Camilo's bare feet swinging over the edge of the bed and landing on the cream-colored tile floor. The tiles are cool ceramic, typical of Barranquilla houses where tile helps manage the heat. A pair of blue rubber flip-flops — chanclas — sit beside the bed, slightly askew. His right foot nudges the soccer ball, which rolls a few inches across the tile with a soft sound. The bottom hem of his cotton shorts is visible above his calves, which show the lean muscle of a young athlete. Under the bed, the edge of a school backpack and a crumpled t-shirt are just visible in the shadow.

### Scene 006: Checking Phone
**Time:** 6:06 AM — growing golden light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Camilo sits on the edge of the bed, phone in both hands, scrolling through notifications. The screen shows a group chat with soccer teammates — messages about afternoon practice time and a fire emoji. His thumbs move across the screen quickly. He wears the Colombia jersey and cotton shorts, bare feet flat on the cool tile. The charging cable hangs from the nightstand, disconnected. The ceiling fan spins above, stirring the warm morning air. A small trophy on the shelf catches a glint of the early light coming through the curtain.

### Scene 007: Standing and Stretching
**Time:** 6:08 AM — bright warm morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, full body view
**Description:** Camilo stands beside his bed, arms raised high above his head in a full-body stretch. His fingers interlace and he arches his back slightly, the Colombia jersey riding up to show a sliver of his stomach. His eyes are half-closed, mouth open in a lingering yawn. The soccer ball has rolled to the center of the room. His school backpack — dark blue with a small Colombian flag patch — sits on the wooden desk chair. The thin curtains glow with golden Caribbean morning light. The bedroom door is open, and the hallway beyond is still dim.

### Scene 008: Opening the Curtains
**Time:** 6:09 AM — golden Caribbean morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, view toward window
**Description:** Camilo pushes aside the thin cotton curtains with one hand, squinting at the bright tropical morning light that floods the room. Through the window, the view shows a Barranquilla neighborhood: flat-roofed houses in warm colors — yellows, peach, light blue — with laundry lines on rooftops, a few palm trees swaying gently, and a clear Caribbean sky already turning brilliant blue. The street below is quiet except for a vendor pushing a fruit cart. The warm air rushes in, thick with tropical humidity. Camilo's face is lit golden by the sunrise, his brown eyes adjusting to the brightness. The soccer posters on the opposite wall are now vivid in the full light.

### Scene 009: Making the Bed
**Time:** 6:11 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, view of bed
**Description:** Camilo pulls the Colombia flag bedsheet up toward the pillow with both hands, straightening it roughly over the mattress. A teenager's effort at bed-making — quick and functional rather than perfect. He smooths the yellow, blue, and red stripes with one palm. The single white pillow gets flipped and placed at the head. The faded Colombia jersey he slept in is tossed onto the desk chair on top of the backpack. The soccer ball has been kicked gently against the wall, resting there. Morning sunlight streams across the bed and the tile floor. The ceiling fan hums steadily.

### Scene 010: Choosing Clothes for School
**Time:** 6:13 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at the closet
**Description:** Camilo stands at the open closet, sliding hangers along the wooden rod. His school uniforms hang on the left side — three identical white short-sleeve button-up shirts and two pairs of navy blue pants, all on plastic hangers. On the right side hang casual t-shirts, a couple of polo shirts, and his red and white Junior de Barranquilla soccer jersey for practice. He pulls out one white shirt and a pair of navy pants, draping them over his arm. On the closet floor sit his black school shoes next to a second pair of cleats (newer, white and green). A small shelf inside holds folded shorts, a stack of t-shirts, and a baseball cap. A belt hook on the closet door holds a black leather belt.

### Scene 011: Gathering School Supplies
**Time:** 6:15 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at the desk
**Description:** Camilo stands at the small wooden desk, opening his dark blue school backpack and checking the contents. He flips through a math textbook with a worn blue cover, a Spanish literature notebook with notes visible inside, and a science folder with printed worksheets. He slides a pencil case — black with a small soccer ball design — into the front pocket of the backpack. On the desk surface, a spiral notebook lies open to a half-finished homework assignment. The pencil cup holds pens, pencils, an eraser, and a small ruler. The shelf above shows the row of soccer trophies, their small gold and silver figures frozen mid-kick.

### Scene 012: Packing the Soccer Bag
**Time:** 6:17 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at the foot of the bed
**Description:** Camilo kneels on the tile floor beside a red drawstring sports bag, packing his soccer gear for afternoon practice. He rolls the red and white Junior de Barranquilla jersey carefully and places it inside. Black shorts go in next, folded flat. He picks up the pair of muddy cleats from by the door, knocks them together to shake off dried dirt flakes onto the tile, and tucks them into the bag. Two shin guards — white plastic with foam backing — go in on top. He pulls a pair of long red soccer socks from the closet floor and stuffs them in last. The drawstring bag sits plump and full.

### Scene 013: Heading to the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:19 AM — bright morning hallway light
**Setting:** Upstairs hallway, viewed from behind Camilo
**Description:** Camilo walks down the narrow upstairs hallway toward the bathroom, his school uniform draped over one arm, bare feet padding on the tile floor. He still wears the Colombia jersey and cotton shorts. The hallway walls are painted a warm cream color. Family photographs in simple frames line the wall — a baby photo of Valentina, a family portrait at Carnival, Camilo's school soccer team holding a trophy, and a faded photograph of his grandparents. A framed image of the Virgen del Carmen hangs near the bathroom door. The bathroom door ahead is ajar, a sliver of light visible inside. From downstairs, the sound of pots and the smell of something cooking rises — mama is starting breakfast.

## PART 2: BATHROOM — GETTING READY (6:20 AM - 6:40 AM)

### Scene 014: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:20 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, wide view from doorway
**Description:** Camilo pushes open the bathroom door and steps inside, reaching for the light switch with his free hand. The overhead fluorescent light flickers on, bright and white. The bathroom has white and light blue tile walls, a single porcelain sink with a wooden cabinet below, a rectangular mirror above the sink, and a shower area in the corner with a blue plastic curtain pulled to one side. Colored towels hang from hooks on the wall — a blue one for Camilo, a pink one for Valentina, larger ones for his parents. His school uniform is draped over the towel hook beside the door. A small window near the ceiling is cracked open, letting in warm morning air and the distant sound of a rooster crowing.

### Scene 015: Turning on the Sink
**Time:** 6:21 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Camilo stands at the sink, turning the chrome faucet handle. Water flows out in a clear stream. He cups both hands under the cool water and splashes it on his face, eyes closed, water dripping from his chin. Droplets land on the white porcelain sink rim and the light blue tile countertop. The mirror above reflects his wet face — short black hair still mussed from sleep, water beading on his light brown skin. A bar of white soap sits in a ceramic dish beside the faucet. The teen toiletry shelf to the right of the mirror holds a stick of deodorant, a small jar of hair gel, and a blue plastic comb.

### Scene 016: Washing Face with Soap
**Time:** 6:22 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, close-up at sink
**Description:** Camilo lathers the white bar soap between his wet hands, working up a foam. He rubs the sudsy foam across his face — forehead, cheeks, chin, nose — eyes scrunched shut. White soap bubbles cover his light brown skin. The bar of soap sits back in its ceramic dish, slightly smaller now. The faucet runs a thin stream. The mirror reflects his soap-covered face and the blue tile wall behind him. His Colombia jersey collar is damp where water has splashed. The warm humid bathroom air carries the clean scent of soap.

### Scene 017: Rinsing Face
**Time:** 6:23 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Camilo cups water in both hands and rinses the soap from his face in two splashes. Water runs down his neck and dampens the collar of his sleep jersey further. He grabs for the blue towel hanging beside the mirror and presses it against his face, patting dry. His skin looks fresh and clean, water droplets still clinging to his eyebrows. The soap dish has a thin puddle around the bar. A few soap bubbles slide down the inside of the porcelain sink toward the drain.

### Scene 018: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 6:24 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Camilo holds a green toothbrush and squeezes a line of white toothpaste from a tube onto the bristles. He brushes with quick back-and-forth strokes, mouth foaming. His reflection in the mirror shows him mid-brush — lips pulled back, white foam at the corners of his mouth. The toothpaste tube — a standard mint flavor — sits on the shelf beside the sink. A plastic cup holder mounted to the wall holds four toothbrushes: green (Camilo's), pink (Valentina's), white (mama's), and blue (papa's). His brown eyes watch his reflection as he brushes methodically, moving from top teeth to bottom.

### Scene 019: Rinsing and Spitting
**Time:** 6:26 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Camilo bends over the sink, spitting out toothpaste foam in a white stream. He cups water from the faucet in one hand and rinses his mouth, swishing and spitting again. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, then properly with the blue towel. The green toothbrush goes back in the cup holder. A streak of white toothpaste remains on the edge of the sink. The drain gurgles softly. Camilo checks his teeth in the mirror, pulling his lips back in an exaggerated grin to inspect them, satisfied.

### Scene 020: Applying Deodorant
**Time:** 6:27 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Camilo pulls off the faded Colombia jersey, hanging it on the towel hook. He stands in his cotton shorts, lean teenage frame visible — slim arms, flat stomach, the build of an active young soccer player. He picks up the stick of deodorant from the shelf, uncaps it, and applies it under each arm with two quick swipes. The deodorant stick is a blue brand meant for teens, with a sports-themed label. He caps it and sets it back on the shelf beside the jar of hair gel. The bathroom mirror reflects his torso and the light blue tiles behind him. The small window lets in a breeze.

### Scene 021: Fixing Hair with Gel
**Time:** 6:28 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, close-up at mirror
**Description:** Camilo unscrews the lid of a small jar of hair gel, scooping a dab onto his fingertips. He works the clear gel through his short black hair, pushing the slightly wavy strands into place — neat on the sides, a little lift on top. He tilts his head left and right, checking the result in the mirror, then makes a small adjustment with his comb. The blue plastic comb has a few black hairs caught in it. The jar of gel sits open on the shelf, its surface glistening. His hair looks tidy and controlled now, the wavy texture smoothed. He seems pleased with the result, giving a small nod to his reflection.

### Scene 022: Putting on School Shirt
**Time:** 6:30 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, near door
**Description:** Camilo takes the white short-sleeve button-up shirt from the towel hook where he hung it. He slides his arms through the sleeves and begins buttoning from the bottom up, fingers working each small white button. The shirt is crisp and clean — mama must have ironed it. The white fabric contrasts with his light brown skin at the collar. He tucks the shirt hem into his navy blue pants, which he has pulled on over his shorts. The black leather belt is threaded through the belt loops but not yet buckled. His reflection in the mirror shows a schoolboy taking shape.

### Scene 023: Buckling the Belt
**Time:** 6:31 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, mid-body view
**Description:** Camilo threads the end of the black leather belt through the silver buckle, pulling it snug around his waist. The belt sits neatly over the tucked-in white shirt, holding the navy blue pants in place. He adjusts the buckle to center it. His school uniform is nearly complete — white shirt crisp, pants pressed, belt buckled. He turns to check the profile in the mirror, smoothing the shirt over his stomach with one hand. The bathroom light catches the silver belt buckle. His school shoes and socks still wait back in the bedroom.

### Scene 024: Final Mirror Check
**Time:** 6:33 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, full-length view in mirror
**Description:** Camilo stands before the bathroom mirror, turning slightly to check his full uniform appearance. White button-up shirt neatly tucked in, navy blue pants with black belt, hair gelled into place. He straightens his collar with both hands, pulling it flat. He brushes a tiny thread off his shoulder. His expression is focused — the careful self-consciousness of a 14-year-old checking his appearance. The mirror shows the bathroom behind him: the blue shower curtain, the towel hooks, the tile walls. Through the small window, a palm frond sways in the early morning breeze. He nods once — good enough — and turns to leave.

### Scene 025: Heading Downstairs
**Time:** 6:35 AM — morning light in stairwell
**Setting:** Stairway, viewed from above
**Description:** Camilo descends the narrow tile stairway from the second floor, one hand trailing along the painted wooden banister. He wears his complete school uniform — white shirt, navy pants, black belt — but is still in bare feet, carrying his black school shoes in one hand by the laces. The stairway walls have a few more family photographs and a small painted ceramic cross. The stairs are cool tile, the same cream color as the hallway. From below, the warm smell of arepas on the stove and fresh coffee fills the stairwell. The sound of his mother's voice floats up, talking to Valentina. Morning light pours in through a window on the landing, casting bright rectangles on the steps.

---

## PART 3: BREAKFAST — KITCHEN & DINING (6:35 AM - 6:50 AM)

### Scene 026: Entering the Kitchen
**Time:** 6:35 AM — bright kitchen morning light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, wide view from doorway
**Description:** Camilo steps into the kitchen, which glows with morning light from a large window above the sink. The kitchen has warm yellow walls — typical of Caribbean Colombian homes — wooden cabinets, a white gas stove where a round arepa griddle sits heating, and a humming refrigerator covered with family photos held by magnets. A round wooden kitchen table with four chairs sits in the center. Diana, his mother — a 42-year-old woman with dark brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, wearing a blue blouse and black pants for work — stands at the stove, flipping arepas with a spatula. A pot of coffee brews on the counter. The tile floor is clean and cool under Camilo's bare feet.

### Scene 027: Greeting Mama
**Time:** 6:36 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at stove area
**Description:** Camilo walks up behind his mother at the stove and gives her a quick kiss on the cheek — a standard Colombian greeting. Diana smiles, spatula in one hand, the other hand briefly touching his shoulder. "Buenos dias, mijo," she says. The arepa griddle sizzles with two golden arepas browning on its surface. The counter beside the stove holds a plate with a slab of white costeño cheese, a bowl of scrambled eggs staying warm under a cloth, and a cutting board with sliced papaya — the bright orange flesh vivid against the wooden board. Steam rises from the coffee pot. Camilo's stomach growls audibly.

### Scene 028: Setting the Table
**Time:** 6:37 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Camilo opens the wooden cabinet and pulls out four ceramic plates — white with a simple blue rim — stacking them on his forearm. He carries them to the round kitchen table and places one at each seat. He returns for glasses — four clear drinking glasses — and sets those beside each plate. Then four sets of forks and knives from the drawer, the silverware clinking as he distributes them. The table has a simple woven placemat in the center. Diana watches from the stove, giving an approving nod. Camilo moves efficiently, this is his regular morning chore.

### Scene 029: Pouring Juice
**Time:** 6:38 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Camilo takes a plastic pitcher of fresh juice from the refrigerator — jugo de maracuya, passion fruit juice, pale yellow and slightly pulpy. He pours carefully into each of the four glasses on the table, the juice splashing in with a cool sound. The pitcher is sweating with condensation in the warm kitchen air. A few passion fruit seeds float in the liquid. He sets the pitcher in the center of the table next to the woven placemat. The bright orange morning light through the window makes the pale yellow juice glow in the glasses. The kitchen smells of arepas, fresh coffee, and tropical fruit.

### Scene 030: Valentina Arrives at Breakfast
**Time:** 6:39 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Valentina, Camilo's 10-year-old younger sister, shuffles into the kitchen still looking sleepy. She has long dark brown hair loose around her shoulders, wearing her own school uniform — a white blouse and blue plaid skirt. She drops into her chair at the table with a dramatic sigh, chin resting on her hand. Camilo is already seated across from her, school shoes now on, laces tied. He flicks a balled-up napkin at her across the table. "Despiertate, enana," he teases — wake up, shorty. Valentina sticks her tongue out at him. Diana calls from the stove: "Camilo, dejala en paz" — leave her alone.

### Scene 031: Papa Joins the Table
**Time:** 6:40 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, wide table view
**Description:** Carlos, the father — a 45-year-old man with a stocky build, short graying black hair, and a neat mustache — enters the kitchen in his work clothes: a light blue collared shirt with a shipping company logo on the breast pocket and dark gray pants. He carries a folded newspaper under his arm. "Buenos dias, familia," he announces, dropping a hand on Camilo's shoulder as he passes to his chair. He sets the newspaper beside his plate and reaches for his coffee mug — a large white ceramic mug that Diana has already filled. The family is assembled: Carlos at the head, Diana bringing food from the stove, Camilo and Valentina across from each other.

### Scene 032: Arepas Served
**Time:** 6:41 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table close-up
**Description:** Diana sets the arepa griddle — now used as a serving plate with a cloth underneath — in the center of the table. Six golden-brown arepas sit in a neat row, their surfaces slightly puffed and spotted with dark grill marks. The smell is warm and toasty. Next to the arepas, she places the bowl of fluffy scrambled eggs and the plate of sliced white costeno cheese. Camilo reaches for an arepa immediately, and Diana taps his hand lightly with the spatula — "Espera, let everyone sit down." He grins sheepishly, hand retreating. The passion fruit juice glasses catch the morning light.

### Scene 033: Eating Breakfast — Arepa with Cheese
**Time:** 6:42 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, close-up on Camilo at table
**Description:** Camilo splits open a warm arepa with his fingers, the golden crust cracking to reveal the soft white corn interior. He lays a thick slice of white costeno cheese on top and presses the arepa closed like a sandwich. He takes a large bite — the cheese slightly melting from the arepa's heat, stretching in a thin string as he pulls the arepa away from his mouth. His cheeks puff with the big bite. The plate in front of him holds a second arepa, a heap of scrambled eggs, and a slice of bright orange papaya. His glass of maracuya juice is already half-drained.

### Scene 034: Scrambled Eggs on the Plate
**Time:** 6:44 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, close-up on plate
**Description:** Camilo scoops scrambled eggs onto his plate with a serving spoon, the soft yellow eggs tumbling beside his half-eaten arepa. He picks up his fork and takes a bite — the eggs are seasoned with diced tomato and chopped green onion, typical Colombian style. He chews quickly, a teenager eating with purpose. Across the table, Valentina eats more slowly, picking at her papaya first. Carlos reads the newspaper sports section between bites, coffee mug in hand. Diana sits down at last with her own plate, tucking a napkin across her lap.

### Scene 035: Drinking Juice
**Time:** 6:45 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Camilo picks up his glass of maracuya juice and drinks deeply, the pale yellow liquid tilting toward his lips. A few passion fruit seeds catch on his upper lip and he wipes them away with the back of his hand. Diana gives him a look and he grabs the napkin instead, wiping properly. The glass is nearly empty now, just a thin yellow film and a few seeds remaining at the bottom. The condensation on the glass has made a wet ring on the wooden table surface. Valentina reaches for the pitcher to pour herself more juice, struggling with its weight until Camilo takes it from her and pours.

### Scene 036: Family Breakfast Conversation
**Time:** 6:46 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, wide table view
**Description:** The family eats together, morning conversation flowing. Carlos holds up the newspaper and reads aloud a headline about Junior de Barranquilla's weekend match — "Ganaron tres a uno" — they won three to one. Camilo's eyes light up, fork pausing mid-air, and he launches into analysis of the game he watched. Valentina rolls her eyes, chewing on a piece of papaya. Diana sips her coffee — a small white cup of tinto, strong black Colombian coffee — and reminds Camilo about a science test tomorrow. Plates are mostly cleared, arepa crumbs and egg remnants scattered. The kitchen hums with warm family energy.

### Scene 037: Clearing His Plate
**Time:** 6:48 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Camilo stands up from the table, pushes his chair in with one hand, and carries his plate and empty glass to the kitchen sink. He scrapes the few remaining crumbs into the trash bin beside the sink, then sets the plate and glass in the basin. The faucet drips once. Other dishes from cooking — the arepa griddle, the egg bowl, spatula — are stacked on the counter waiting to be washed. Camilo rinses his hands quickly under the faucet, flicking water off his fingers. Diana reminds him from the table: "Don't forget your lunch money is on the counter."

### Scene 038: Grabbing Lunch Money
**Time:** 6:49 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Camilo picks up a small folded bill from the kitchen counter beside the refrigerator — his lunch money for the school cafeteria. He tucks the bill into the front pocket of his navy blue school pants, patting the pocket to make sure it's secure. A small ceramic bowl on the counter holds keys and loose change. The refrigerator beside him is covered with magnets: a Junior de Barranquilla team magnet, a small Colombian flag magnet, a photo of the family at Carnival with everyone wearing colorful costumes and feathered headpieces, and a magnet from Cartagena's Old City. The morning light reflects off the refrigerator's white surface.

## PART 4: WALKING TO SCHOOL (6:50 AM - 7:00 AM)

### Scene 039: Putting on School Shoes
**Time:** 6:50 AM — bright morning light in entryway
**Setting:** House entryway/front door area
**Description:** Camilo sits on a small wooden bench near the front door, pulling on his black school shoes over white socks. He yanks the laces tight and ties them in quick double knots — a habit from tying cleats. The entryway floor is polished tile, and a shoe rack beside the door holds the family's shoes: Diana's low heels, Carlos's brown work shoes, Valentina's small black Mary Janes, and Camilo's flip-flops. His dark blue school backpack sits on the bench beside him, and the red drawstring soccer bag leans against the wall. A small mirror on the wall reflects his bent figure. Above the front door hangs a small wooden plaque that reads "Dios bendiga este hogar" — God bless this home.

### Scene 040: Slinging on the Backpack
**Time:** 6:51 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** House entryway
**Description:** Camilo stands and swings his dark blue school backpack onto both shoulders, adjusting the straps. The backpack sits snug against his white school shirt, the small Colombian flag patch visible on the top flap. He picks up the red drawstring soccer bag with one hand, looping the string over his right shoulder so it hangs at his hip. The weight of the cleats and shin guards inside makes the bag sag. He checks his pockets — lunch money, phone. He pats his hair once, checking it's still in place. Ready to go.

### Scene 041: Saying Goodbye at the Door
**Time:** 6:52 AM — bright morning light, doorway
**Setting:** Front door, inside looking out
**Description:** The front door is open, revealing the bright morning street outside. Camilo stands in the doorway, backpack on, soccer bag on his shoulder. Diana stands behind him in the entryway, handing him a small plastic water bottle. "Take water, it's going to be hot today." Valentina squeezes past him to go out first — she walks to her own school a few blocks in the other direction with a neighbor. Carlos waves from the kitchen doorway, newspaper still in hand. Camilo gives his mother a kiss on the cheek — "Chao, ma" — and steps out into the morning heat.

### Scene 042: Walking Down the Street
**Time:** 6:53 AM — bright Caribbean morning sun
**Setting:** Residential street in Barranquilla
**Description:** Camilo walks along a narrow residential street in his Barranquilla neighborhood. The sidewalk is cracked concrete, bordered by low walls in front of houses painted in Caribbean colors — peach, turquoise, sun-yellow, coral. Bougainvillea cascades over a wall in a splash of magenta. A mango tree leans over the sidewalk from behind a fence, heavy with green and yellow fruit. The air is already warm and humid, and Camilo squints against the bright morning sun. His white school shirt is bright in the light. Other students in similar uniforms walk ahead and behind — groups of teenagers heading toward school. The sky is brilliant blue, not a cloud in sight.

### Scene 043: Passing the Tienda
**Time:** 6:55 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Neighborhood street, at corner tienda
**Description:** Camilo passes a small neighborhood tienda — a corner store with its metal shutters rolled up, displays of snacks, drinks, and household goods visible inside. A hand-painted sign above the entrance reads "Tienda Doña Carmen" in red and blue letters. Plastic bags of chips and candy hang from hooks on a board outside the entrance. A glass refrigerator case near the door holds cold drinks — Coca-Cola, Colombiana soda in orange bottles, bags of water, juice boxes. An older woman in an apron waves from behind the counter: "Buenos dias, Camilo!" He waves back, adjusting his backpack strap. A yellow stray dog lies in the shade of the tienda's awning, panting in the heat.

### Scene 044: Greeting a Classmate
**Time:** 6:56 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Neighborhood street
**Description:** A boy in the same school uniform — white shirt, navy pants — falls into step beside Camilo. This is Santiago, a classmate and friend, slightly taller with curly brown hair and a wide grin. They do a quick handshake-fist bump combo, the casual greeting of teenage boys. Santiago carries a heavy backpack low on his back. They walk side by side, Santiago talking animatedly about a goal he saw in last night's match, hands gesturing to illustrate the curve of the shot. Camilo nods, grinning, adding his own commentary. The street widens as they approach the school zone, more students visible ahead.

### Scene 045: Crossing the Street
**Time:** 6:57 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Intersection near school
**Description:** Camilo and Santiago stop at a busy intersection, waiting for a gap in traffic. Motorcycles buzz past — Barranquilla is full of motos. A colorful public bus rumbles by, packed with passengers, cumbia music thumping from its speakers. A traffic light hangs overhead, turning from red to green. Camilo checks both ways, the soccer bag bouncing against his hip as he jogs across the asphalt crosswalk. Santiago follows, dodging a bicycle. On the far corner, a fruit vendor has set up a small stand with piles of mangoes, bananas, and coconuts. The school's perimeter wall is visible ahead, painted white with the school name in dark blue letters.

### Scene 046: Approaching the School Gate
**Time:** 6:58 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** School entrance
**Description:** The school comes into full view — a two-story concrete building painted white and blue, with a wide metal gate open at the entrance. A sign above reads "Institucion Educativa Simon Bolivar" in dark blue letters on a white background. Students stream through the gate in matching uniforms — white shirts and navy pants or skirts. A security guard in a light blue shirt stands at the gate, nodding to students as they enter. Camilo adjusts his backpack and walks through the gate beside Santiago. The schoolyard inside is a concrete courtyard with a few trees providing spots of shade. The Colombian flag and the Barranquilla city flag hang limp in the windless morning heat from a flagpole near the entrance.

### Scene 047: The Schoolyard
**Time:** 6:59 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** School courtyard
**Description:** Camilo crosses the concrete schoolyard, weaving through clusters of students. Some stand in groups chatting, some sit on concrete benches under the shade of a samán tree. Girls in white blouses and navy skirts walk arm-in-arm. A group of boys kick a small plastic ball in a tight circle near the far wall — an improvised game of "fútbol de patio." Camilo drops his soccer bag on a bench and joins the circle briefly, trapping the plastic ball under his school shoe with practiced ease, then flicking it to another boy. Santiago watches, leaning against the wall. The two-story school building wraps around three sides of the courtyard, classroom windows open for ventilation, ceiling fans visible inside.

### Scene 048: Storing the Soccer Bag
**Time:** 7:00 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** School hallway, at lockers
**Description:** Camilo walks down a ground-floor hallway of the school building. The walls are painted white with a blue stripe at waist height. Numbered metal lockers line one wall — small half-height lockers, dented and scuffed from years of teenage use. Camilo stops at locker 47, spins the combination dial, and pulls it open with a metallic clang. Inside, a couple of notebooks sit on the shelf. He pushes the red drawstring soccer bag in on top, wedging it tight. The cleats bulge against the locker wall. He closes the locker and clicks the combination lock shut. The hallway is busy with students flowing toward classrooms, voices echoing off the tile floor and concrete walls.

### Scene 049: Entering the Classroom
**Time:** 7:02 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, from doorway
**Description:** Camilo enters his 8th-grade classroom — a rectangular room with rows of individual wooden desks, each with an attached chair. The walls are white with educational posters: a periodic table, a map of Colombia with all its departments labeled, a timeline of Colombian history, and a bulletin board with student work pinned up. A large green chalkboard stretches across the front wall, already showing the day's date written in white chalk. The teacher's desk sits in the front corner, cluttered with papers and a textbook. Tall windows line one wall, open to catch any breeze, with a view of the courtyard's samán tree. A ceiling fan spins on high. Camilo makes his way to his desk — third row, second from the window.

### Scene 050: Sitting Down at His Desk
**Time:** 7:03 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at Camilo's desk
**Description:** Camilo slides into his desk seat, the wooden chair scraping slightly on the tile floor. He sets his backpack on the floor beside the desk, leaning it against the desk leg. He unzips the front pocket and pulls out the black pencil case with the soccer ball design, placing it on the desk surface. He opens it to check: two blue pens, a black pen, a pencil, an eraser, a small sharpener, and a short ruler. The desk surface is worn wood, carved with initials and doodles from past students. A small heart with "JR" scratched inside is visible near the corner. Santiago drops into the desk beside him, and they exchange a quick look — the universal teenager signal that class is about to begin.

## PART 5: SCHOOL DAY — MORNING CLASSES (7:05 AM - 9:30 AM)

### Scene 051: Math Class Begins
**Time:** 7:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, front view
**Description:** The math teacher — a thin man in his 50s with glasses and a short-sleeve dress shirt — stands at the chalkboard, writing an equation in white chalk. The equation is a simple algebraic expression: 3x + 7 = 22. He taps the chalk against the board for emphasis. Students sit at their desks, notebooks open. Camilo pulls out his math textbook — a thick blue-covered book with "Matematicas 8" printed on the front — and flips to the assigned page. He clicks his blue pen, ready to copy the equation. The ceiling fan hums. The classroom is warm despite the open windows. A fly circles lazily near the chalkboard.

### Scene 052: Copying Notes from the Board
**Time:** 7:15 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, close-up on desk
**Description:** Camilo's hand moves across his open spiral notebook, copying equations from the chalkboard in neat blue ink. His handwriting is angular and quick — a teenage boy's scrawl that stays mostly within the ruled lines. The notebook page shows three algebraic equations already copied, with work shown below each one. His math textbook lies open beside the notebook, the pages showing practice problems with diagrams. The pencil case sits at the top of the desk. Beside him, Santiago leans over to peek at Camilo's work, pen cap between his teeth.

### Scene 053: Solving a Problem at the Board
**Time:** 7:30 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at chalkboard
**Description:** Camilo stands at the green chalkboard, a short piece of white chalk in his right hand. The teacher has called him up to solve a problem. He writes carefully, the chalk squeaking as he works through the algebra steps: isolating the variable, dividing both sides. His brow furrows in concentration, tongue touching his upper lip — a habit when he thinks hard. Behind him, thirty students watch from their desks. Some are engaged; a few look bored. Santiago gives a thumbs-up from his seat. Camilo circles his final answer, sets the chalk in the metal tray, and turns back to face the class with a small, relieved smile.

### Scene 054: Spanish Literature Class
**Time:** 7:50 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, new teacher
**Description:** A new teacher stands at the front — a woman in her 40s with reading glasses perched on her nose, holding a paperback book. The chalkboard behind her reads "Gabriel Garcia Marquez — Cien Anos de Soledad" in cursive. She reads a passage aloud, her voice animated. Camilo sits at his desk, a Spanish literature notebook open in front of him, his own copy of the book propped against his backpack. The book cover shows a tropical landscape with butterflies. He follows along, finger tracing the lines, mouthing words silently. The classroom walls now show a poster of famous Colombian authors beside the periodic table.

### Scene 055: Writing in Spanish Notebook
**Time:** 8:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, close-up on desk
**Description:** Camilo writes in his Spanish literature notebook, answering a question the teacher has posed about the reading. His blue pen moves across the lined page, words flowing in Spanish. The question written at the top of the page reads: "Describe el pueblo de Macondo con tus propias palabras." — Describe the town of Macondo in your own words. He pauses, pen tip resting on the paper, thinking. Then he continues writing, the sentences forming in his neat-but-hasty handwriting. The Garcia Marquez book lies beside the notebook, a folded corner marking his page. A girl at the desk ahead turns to borrow an eraser; Camilo slides his across the desk without looking up.

### Scene 056: Science Class — Entering the Lab
**Time:** 8:30 AM — bright fluorescent light
**Setting:** Science lab, from doorway
**Description:** The students file into the science lab — a different room from the regular classroom, with long black-topped lab benches instead of individual desks, each with a pair of tall stools. The room smells faintly of chemicals. Shelves along the back wall hold glass beakers, test tubes in wooden racks, and sealed jars with labels. A poster of the human skeletal system hangs beside a diagram of a plant cell. The science teacher — a young man with a goatee and a lab coat over his shirt — stands at the front bench, arranging equipment: a Bunsen burner connected to a small gas tank, a metal tripod stand, and several glass flasks. Camilo and Santiago sit at the same bench, pulling their stools close.

### Scene 057: Science Experiment Setup
**Time:** 8:40 AM — bright fluorescent light
**Setting:** Science lab, at lab bench
**Description:** Camilo and Santiago work at their lab bench, following instructions from a printed worksheet. Camilo holds a glass beaker up to eye level, reading the measurement markings on the side — 100 mL, 200 mL. He pours clear water from a plastic bottle into the beaker, stopping carefully at the 150 mL line. Santiago writes down the measurement on their shared worksheet. On the bench surface sit three glass test tubes in a wooden rack, a small digital scale, a box of baking soda, and a bottle of vinegar. The teacher's instructions on the chalkboard read "Reacciones Quimicas — Experimento 3." Camilo's white school shirt sleeves are pushed up to his elbows.

### Scene 058: Observing a Chemical Reaction
**Time:** 8:50 AM — bright fluorescent light
**Setting:** Science lab, close-up at bench
**Description:** Camilo holds a test tube carefully between his thumb and forefinger, watching a fizzing reaction inside. He has added vinegar to baking soda, and white bubbles foam up energetically inside the glass tube. His brown eyes are wide with focus, mouth slightly open. The bubbles rise and threaten to overflow the rim. Santiago leans close, notebook ready, pen poised to record observations. Other students around the lab have similar reactions happening at their benches — fizzing, bubbling sounds fill the room. The teacher walks between benches, checking progress. A poster about lab safety — goggles, gloves, no running — hangs on the wall near the door.

### Scene 059: Recording Lab Results
**Time:** 9:00 AM — bright fluorescent light
**Setting:** Science lab, at bench
**Description:** Camilo bends over the worksheet on the lab bench, writing observations in the results section. His pen describes what he saw: "La mezcla produjo burbujas y gas. La reaccion fue rapida." — The mixture produced bubbles and gas. The reaction was fast. Santiago reads over his shoulder, adding a comment. The used test tubes sit in the rack, residue of the reaction visible inside — a white chalky film. The beaker of water is mostly empty. Camilo sketches a small diagram on the worksheet showing the before and after of the experiment, labeling "vinagre" and "bicarbonato." The teacher announces five minutes to clean up.

### Scene 060: Cleaning Up the Lab Bench
**Time:** 9:10 AM — bright fluorescent light
**Setting:** Science lab, at bench
**Description:** Camilo carries the used test tubes to the lab sink at the side of the room, rinsing each one under the tap and placing them upside-down in a drying rack. Santiago wipes down the black lab bench surface with a damp cloth, pushing crumbs of baking soda into his cupped hand. The beaker gets rinsed and returned to the shelf. The worksheet, now complete with observations and diagrams, sits at the edge of the bench ready to turn in. Camilo dries his hands on the front of his navy pants — an unconscious teenager habit — and grabs the worksheet, walking it to the teacher's desk and placing it on the growing stack.

### Scene 061: History Class
**Time:** 9:20 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, back to regular room
**Description:** Back in the regular classroom, the history teacher — a heavyset woman with short curly hair and reading glasses on a chain around her neck — pulls down a large wall map of South America. She points with a wooden pointer at the northern coast of Colombia, tracing the route of Simon Bolivar's liberation campaigns. The chalkboard reads "La Independencia de Colombia — 1810-1819." Camilo's history notebook is open on his desk, a timeline drawn across two pages. He copies dates and locations as the teacher narrates the events. The classroom is growing warmer as the morning progresses; students fan themselves with notebook pages. The ceiling fan works hard but barely stirs the heavy tropical air.

### Scene 062: Taking a History Quiz
**Time:** 9:35 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at desk
**Description:** The history teacher passes out single-page printed quizzes face-down on each desk. Camilo flips his over when she says "Comiencen" — begin. The quiz has ten multiple-choice questions about Colombian independence. His pen hovers over the first question, reading carefully. He circles answer "B," then moves to the next. His brow is slightly furrowed in concentration. The history textbook has been put away — no open books allowed. Santiago chews his pen cap, staring at his own quiz. The wall clock above the chalkboard shows 9:35, the second hand ticking visibly. Camilo works steadily through the questions, pausing only once to erase and reconsider.

---

## PART 6: SCHOOL DAY — RECESS & ENGLISH CLASS (9:45 AM - 11:30 AM)

### Scene 063: Recess Bell Rings
**Time:** 9:45 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, near door
**Description:** A loud electric bell rings through the hallway, and the classroom erupts in motion. Students push back chairs, grab bags, and head for the door. Camilo stuffs his history notebook into his backpack and zips it halfway closed. He leaves the backpack on his desk — the classroom stays open during break. Santiago is already at the door, beckoning. The teacher calls after the departing students about a reading assignment. Camilo slings his arm over Santiago's shoulder as they walk out into the sunny hallway, the corridor filling with teenagers released from classrooms on both sides.

### Scene 064: The School Courtyard at Recess
**Time:** 9:47 AM — bright Caribbean midmorning sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, wide view
**Description:** The school courtyard buzzes with energy. Students cluster under the samán tree's broad shade, sit on concrete benches, or walk in groups. A game of "fútbol de patio" is already in full swing in an open area — boys kicking a small plastic ball between makeshift goals marked by backpacks. Camilo jogs over and joins, immediately receiving a pass and dribbling past a defender with a quick step-over. His school shoes slap on the concrete. Sweat already beads on his forehead under the Caribbean sun. Girls sit on the courtyard steps, watching and chatting. A teacher on break supervision leans against a column in the shade, arms crossed.

### Scene 065: Playing Courtyard Soccer
**Time:** 9:50 AM — bright sun, harsh shadows
**Setting:** School courtyard, at the game
**Description:** Camilo controls the small plastic ball with the inside of his right school shoe, feinting left, then pushing the ball right past a classmate who lunges and misses. He accelerates two steps and shoots — the ball zips between two backpacks serving as goal posts. His teammates cheer, and he pumps his fist. Sweat darkens the collar of his white school shirt. The concrete courtyard is hot under the sun, heat radiating upward. Santiago plays goalkeeper, crouching between the backpacks. Other students ring the game as spectators, some shouting encouragement. The samán tree's shadow doesn't quite reach the playing area.

### Scene 066: Buying a Snack
**Time:** 9:55 AM — bright courtyard light
**Setting:** School canteen window
**Description:** Camilo stands in a short line at the school canteen — a window cut into the courtyard wall with a metal counter. A woman in a white apron and hairnet serves from behind the counter. A handwritten menu board lists prices: "Empanada - $2,000," "Jugo natural - $1,500," "Deditos de queso - $1,000." Camilo reaches the window and orders an empanada, pulling crumpled bills from his pocket. The woman hands him a golden-brown empanada on a small square of wax paper — the fried pastry still hot, stuffed with seasoned beef. He takes a bite immediately, steam escaping from the filling, and grins at the taste.

### Scene 067: Eating the Empanada
**Time:** 9:57 AM — bright courtyard shade
**Setting:** School courtyard, under samán tree
**Description:** Camilo sits on a concrete bench under the samán tree, legs stretched out in front of him. He holds the empanada in both hands, taking large bites. The golden fried shell crunches, revealing the spiced beef and potato filling inside. Crumbs fall on his navy pants, and he brushes them off. Santiago sits beside him with his own snack — deditos de queso, small fried cheese sticks. They talk between bites about the upcoming club practice. A bottle of water — bought from the canteen — sits between them on the bench. Other students mill around, the courtyard alive with voices, laughter, and the distant thump of the plastic ball game still going. A warm breeze stirs the samán tree's leaves overhead.

### Scene 068: Drinking Water
**Time:** 10:00 AM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, under shade
**Description:** Camilo uncaps the plastic water bottle and drinks deeply, his throat working as he swallows. The water is room temperature — nothing stays cold long in Barranquilla. He lowers the bottle and exhales, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. His forehead glistens with sweat from the courtyard soccer game. The white school shirt is slightly untucked on one side from playing. His hair — so carefully gelled that morning — has lost some of its shape, a few wavy strands falling across his forehead. He re-caps the bottle and drops it in the side pocket of his backpack, which he has retrieved from the classroom.

### Scene 069: English Class Begins
**Time:** 10:15 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, front view
**Description:** The English teacher stands at the front of the classroom — a young woman with short hair and glasses, wearing a colorful blouse and dark skirt. She speaks in English, writing vocabulary words on the chalkboard in large letters: "BREAKFAST — LUNCH — DINNER — KITCHEN — TABLE." Below each word she writes the Spanish translation in smaller letters. Camilo is back at his desk, a separate thin English notebook open, copying the words carefully. English is his most challenging subject, and he concentrates hard, sounding out the words silently. A poster on the wall shows the English alphabet with pictures: A-apple, B-ball, C-cat. The teacher's accent is Colombian but her English is clear and deliberate.

### Scene 070: English Vocabulary Exercise
**Time:** 10:25 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at desk
**Description:** The teacher projects an image on a portable screen using a small projector — a picture of a family eating breakfast at a kitchen table. "What do you see?" she asks in English. Camilo studies the image: plates, glasses, bread, eggs, a coffee cup. He raises his hand tentatively. "I see... a table with plates and... eggs," he says slowly, the English words coming out with a thick accent. The teacher smiles and nods encouragingly: "Very good, Camilo. What else?" He looks again. "A cup of... coffee?" The projector hums on the teacher's desk, the image slightly washed out by the tropical light from the windows.

### Scene 071: Pair Work — English Dialogue
**Time:** 10:35 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at desks
**Description:** Camilo and Santiago turn their desks to face each other for a pair exercise. They hold printed worksheets with a simple English dialogue about daily routines: "What time do you wake up?" "I wake up at six o'clock." "What do you eat for breakfast?" They read the lines to each other, stumbling over pronunciation, laughing when Santiago says "brek-fas" instead of "breakfast." The teacher circulates between pairs, correcting gently. Camilo's worksheet has pencil notes in the margins — Spanish translations of words he doesn't know. He underlines "routine" and writes "rutina" beside it.

### Scene 072: Writing English Sentences
**Time:** 10:50 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, close-up on notebook
**Description:** Camilo writes English sentences in his thin English notebook, the blue ink careful and deliberate. The exercise asks students to write five sentences about their morning routine using the vocabulary from the lesson. He writes slowly: "I wake up at six. I brush my teeth. I eat arepas for breakfast. I walk to school. I like soccer." The handwriting in English is neater than his Spanish notes — he writes more slowly and carefully. A few words have been crossed out and rewritten. The English textbook lies open beside the notebook, showing a vocabulary list with illustrations of daily activities: a cartoon figure showering, eating, walking.

### Scene 073: Correcting English Homework
**Time:** 11:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at desk
**Description:** The teacher passes back graded homework papers. Camilo receives his sheet — the top shows "7/10" in red ink, with checkmarks and a few corrections. He reads the teacher's notes: "Good effort! Watch spelling: 'becouse' should be 'because.'" He frowns slightly, then nods, picking up his pen to write the correct spelling three times in the margin — a correction technique the teacher requires. Santiago peeks at Camilo's grade, and Camilo quickly covers it with his hand, grinning. "Better than last time," he says quietly. The teacher moves to the next topic, erasing the chalkboard with a felt eraser that leaves ghostly chalk traces.

### Scene 074: End of English Class
**Time:** 11:15 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, near desk
**Description:** The English teacher writes the homework assignment on the board: "Write 10 sentences about your family in English. Due Thursday." Camilo copies it into the back page of his English notebook, where he keeps a running list of assignments. He underlines "Thursday" and draws a small star beside it as a reminder. Students are already restless, shuffling papers and zipping bags. The teacher reminds them: "Practice speaking at home!" Camilo closes his notebook and slides it into his backpack. He stretches his arms behind the desk, his back stiff from sitting. The classroom clock reads 11:15.

---

## PART 7: SCHOOL DAY — FINAL CLASSES & LUNCH (11:15 AM - 1:00 PM)

### Scene 075: Physical Education — Changing Shoes
**Time:** 11:20 AM — bright sun, outdoor area
**Setting:** School courtyard edge, at bench
**Description:** Camilo sits on a concrete bench at the edge of the courtyard, changing from his black school shoes into a pair of worn running sneakers he keeps in his backpack for PE class. He unties the school shoes and sets them neatly side by side, then pulls on the sneakers — white with blue stripes, slightly scuffed and dirty. He double-knots the laces. Other students do the same around him, some already jogging to the open area the PE teacher has designated. The PE teacher — a muscular man in athletic shorts and a whistle around his neck — waves students over to the sunny concrete area.

### Scene 076: Warm-Up Stretches
**Time:** 11:25 AM — bright Caribbean sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, open area
**Description:** Students stand in rows facing the PE teacher, following his lead in warm-up stretches. Camilo stands in the second row, reaching for his toes with straight legs — his flexibility from soccer training makes this easy. He holds the stretch, fingertips touching the ground. Then arm circles — swinging both arms in wide loops. Then high knees — lifting each knee to chest height in rapid alternation. His white school shirt pulls tight across his back during the stretches. Sweat already forms on his forehead. The Caribbean sun beats down on the concrete, the heat radiating upward. Some students struggle with the stretches; Camilo moves fluidly, his athletic conditioning evident.

### Scene 077: Running Laps
**Time:** 11:30 AM — bright sun, intense heat
**Setting:** School perimeter, along courtyard edge
**Description:** The PE teacher blows his whistle, and students begin running laps around the perimeter of the school courtyard. Camilo runs at an easy pace, his sneakers rhythmic on the concrete. He's near the front of the group, not pushing hard — this is nothing compared to soccer drills. His white shirt is starting to show sweat patches at the collar and under the arms. Santiago jogs beside him, breathing harder. They complete the courtyard's rectangular path — past the canteen window, along the back wall, past the flagpole, and back to the start. The PE teacher counts laps on his fingers. A water bottle waits on the bench. Palm trees beyond the school wall sway in a slight breeze that doesn't reach the courtyard.

### Scene 078: Soccer Drill in PE
**Time:** 11:40 AM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, open area
**Description:** The PE teacher sets up a simple passing drill using four orange cones in a square pattern. Students pair up. Camilo and Santiago face each other, six meters apart, passing a rubber ball back and forth with the insides of their feet. Camilo's passes are crisp and accurate — the ball rolls smoothly across the concrete to Santiago's feet each time. When it's his turn to receive, he cushions the ball with a soft touch, controlling it instantly. Other pairs are less coordinated, balls rolling wide, students chasing after them. The PE teacher observes, offering corrections. Camilo's soccer training shows clearly — his body posture, his balance, the ease of his movement.

### Scene 079: Cool Down and Water
**Time:** 11:55 AM — bright sun, shade of building
**Setting:** School courtyard, at bench in shade
**Description:** PE class ends and students migrate toward the shade of the building overhang. Camilo grabs his water bottle from the bench and drinks, water streaming down his chin. His white school shirt is damp with sweat, clinging to his slim frame. He pulls the fabric away from his skin, fanning himself with the other hand. His hair is flat and wet with perspiration, the morning's gel completely gone. Santiago pours water over his own head, shaking his curly hair like a dog and spraying droplets. The PE teacher dismisses them to change shoes and head to the cafeteria. Camilo sits on the bench, swapping sneakers back for school shoes, the leather hot from sitting in the sun.

### Scene 080: Walking to the Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:00 PM — harsh midday sun
**Setting:** School hallway, ground floor
**Description:** Camilo walks down the ground-floor hallway toward the school cafeteria, backpack on one shoulder. The hallway is crowded with students all heading the same direction — lunch hour. The walls are lined with student artwork and project posters. A banner for an upcoming school event — "Semana Cultural" — stretches across the hallway in red, yellow, and blue (Colombian flag colors). The cafeteria entrance is a wide doorway at the end of the hall, and the sounds of clattering trays and loud conversation spill out. The smell of fried plantains and rice reaches the hallway. Camilo's stomach growls; he picks up his pace.

### Scene 081: Cafeteria Line
**Time:** 12:05 PM — indoor fluorescent light
**Setting:** School cafeteria, serving line
**Description:** Camilo stands in the cafeteria line, holding a brown plastic tray. The cafeteria is a large room with rows of long tables and attached benches, the walls painted pale green. Behind a glass sneeze guard, cafeteria workers in white aprons and hairnets serve food from large metal trays. Camilo shuffles forward in line. The menu today is written on a whiteboard: "Arroz con pollo, ensalada, patacones, jugo de lulo." — Rice with chicken, salad, fried green plantains, lulo fruit juice. Camilo reaches the server and holds out his tray. A woman scoops a mound of yellow rice with shredded chicken onto his plate, adds a small pile of green salad, and places three golden patacones beside the rice.

### Scene 082: Getting Juice
**Time:** 12:07 PM — cafeteria light
**Setting:** School cafeteria, at drink station
**Description:** Camilo moves to the drink station at the end of the serving line. A large orange plastic dispenser holds lulo juice — a tart, greenish-yellow Colombian fruit juice. He presses the lever and fills a clear plastic cup, the juice swirling with pulp. He sets the cup on his tray beside the plate. The tray now holds: a plate of arroz con pollo with salad and patacones, a cup of lulo juice, a white plastic fork and knife wrapped in a paper napkin. He picks up the loaded tray carefully, balancing it with both hands, and scans the cafeteria for a seat.

### Scene 083: Sitting with Friends at Lunch
**Time:** 12:08 PM — cafeteria light
**Setting:** School cafeteria, at table
**Description:** Camilo slides onto the bench at a long cafeteria table, setting his tray down. Santiago already sits across from him, mouth full of rice. Two other friends — boys in matching school uniforms — sit at the same table. Camilo picks up his fork and digs into the arroz con pollo, scooping a large forkful of rice and chicken. The yellow rice is seasoned with annatto and cumin, studded with peas and diced carrots. He chews quickly, a teenager eating with single-minded focus. The cafeteria roars with the conversation of hundreds of students, trays clanking, chairs scraping. Someone at a distant table laughs loudly.

### Scene 084: Eating Patacones
**Time:** 12:12 PM — cafeteria light
**Setting:** School cafeteria, close-up at table
**Description:** Camilo picks up a patacon — a thick, flat disc of fried green plantain, golden-brown and crunchy — and takes a big bite. The patacon cracks audibly, the starchy interior soft and warm. He dips the next bite into a small dollop of hogao — a tomato and onion sauce — on the edge of his plate. The combination of crunchy plantain and tangy sauce makes him nod with satisfaction. His plate is half-cleared already, the chicken and rice diminishing rapidly. The lulo juice glass is almost empty, a few pulp flecks clinging to the sides. Santiago steals one of Camilo's patacones, and Camilo fake-protests, guarding his tray.

### Scene 085: Lunchtime Conversation
**Time:** 12:15 PM — cafeteria light
**Setting:** School cafeteria, at table
**Description:** Camilo leans back on the cafeteria bench, plate mostly empty, sipping the last of his lulo juice. The conversation at the table has turned to soccer — always soccer. One friend holds up his phone under the table (phones technically not allowed at lunch), showing a highlight reel from a Copa Libertadores match. Camilo leans forward to watch, eyes bright. "Did you see that pass?" he whispers, tracing the ball's path in the air with his finger. Santiago argues for a different player's goal. The lunchtime buzz fills the cafeteria around them. A teacher walks past, and the phone disappears instantly under the table.

### Scene 086: Clearing the Tray
**Time:** 12:25 PM — cafeteria light
**Setting:** School cafeteria, at tray return
**Description:** Camilo stands and carries his empty tray to the tray return window — a rectangular opening in the wall where students stack used trays. He scrapes the few remaining rice grains and salad leaves into a trash bin, then stacks the tray on the pile with the others. The plastic cup and utensils go into separate bins. He wipes his hands on his pants — the habitual teenager move — and heads back through the cafeteria, weaving between tables of still-eating students. The cafeteria floor is slightly sticky with spilled juice. He pushes through the exit door and into the hallway, squinting at the bright light streaming through the courtyard doors.

### Scene 087: Lunch Recess — Checking Phone
**Time:** 12:30 PM — bright courtyard shade
**Setting:** School courtyard, under samán tree
**Description:** Camilo sits on the concrete bench under the samán tree, phone in both hands. This is the unofficial phone-allowed period — teachers look the other way during lunch recess. He scrolls through a soccer news app, reading headlines about Colombian league standings. A message pops up from the team group chat: the coach has confirmed practice at 3:30 PM. Camilo types a thumbs-up emoji and sends it. His white school shirt is mostly dry now after PE, but still wrinkled. The courtyard is quieter during lunch hour — most students are still in the cafeteria. A couple of pigeons peck at crumbs on the concrete near his feet.

### Scene 088: Talking with Classmates
**Time:** 12:40 PM — bright courtyard shade
**Setting:** School courtyard, under samán tree
**Description:** A small group gathers on and around the bench. Camilo and Santiago sit on the seat, while two girls from their class sit on the bench back above them, feet on the seat. They discuss a history project due next week — they've been assigned groups. One of the girls — Andrea, with dark hair in a high ponytail — has a notebook out, writing down task assignments. "Camilo, you do the timeline," she says. He nods, hands clasped behind his head, leaning back. "I'll do it tonight after practice." Santiago volunteers for the written report. The warm breeze ruffles Andrea's notebook pages. The samán tree's wide canopy provides welcome shade from the Caribbean sun.

### Scene 089: Afternoon Bell — Back to Class
**Time:** 12:50 PM — bright hallway light
**Setting:** School hallway, walking
**Description:** The electric bell rings again, signaling the end of lunch break. Students stream from the courtyard and cafeteria back toward classrooms. Camilo walks with the flow of traffic, backpack over one shoulder. He passes a bulletin board covered with flyers: a notice about the school soccer tournament next month (he pauses briefly to read it), a poster for the Semana Cultural, and a sign-up sheet for the science fair. He continues down the hallway, the tile floor reflecting the fluorescent lights overhead. Someone bumps his shoulder in the crowd; he barely notices, lost in thought about the afternoon ahead — one more class, then soccer practice.

### Scene 090: Last Class — Geography
**Time:** 12:55 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo settles into his desk for the last class of the day — geography. The teacher, a man with a thick beard and a rolling accent from the Andes, pulls down a large map of Colombia from the wall roller. He points to the Caribbean coast, circling the Barranquilla area with his finger. "Today we study the geography of our own region — La Costa Caribe." Camilo perks up — this is his home. The map shows the Caribbean coastline, the Magdalena River delta, and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains. He opens his geography notebook to a fresh page and writes the date and topic heading. The afternoon heat makes the classroom drowsy; several students stifle yawns.

### Scene 091: Drawing a Map in Geography
**Time:** 1:05 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, close-up on desk
**Description:** The teacher instructs students to draw a map of the Colombian Caribbean region in their notebooks. Camilo pulls out a pencil and begins sketching the coastline — the curve of the bay at Cartagena, the straight stretch toward Barranquilla, the point of La Guajira peninsula. He marks major cities with small dots: Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Valledupar. He labels the Caribbean Sea at the top in block letters. His drawing is rough but enthusiastic — he's more interested in the content than artistic precision. The geography textbook lies open beside him, showing a detailed reference map. He colors the sea with his blue pen, the land left white.

### Scene 092: Geography Class Discussion
**Time:** 1:15 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, from Camilo's perspective
**Description:** The teacher asks the class about economic activities on the Caribbean coast. Camilo raises his hand: "Mi papa works at the port. Barranquilla is one of the biggest ports in Colombia." The teacher nods approvingly, pointing to the Magdalena River on the map — the river that connects Barranquilla to the interior. "Exactly. What else?" Another student mentions tourism in Cartagena. Another says fishing. Camilo adds: "Carnival — Barranquilla's Carnival brings people from everywhere." The teacher writes "ECONOMIA DE LA COSTA" on the board and lists: commerce, ports, tourism, fishing, agriculture, Carnival. Camilo copies the list into his notebook.

### Scene 093: End of School Day Bell
**Time:** 1:25 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** 8th grade classroom, wide view
**Description:** The final bell of the day rings — a long, sustained buzz. The classroom explodes into motion. Chairs scrape back, backpacks zip, conversations erupt. The geography teacher calls out homework assignments over the noise — "Chapter 12, questions 1 through 5!" — but most students are already halfway to the door. Camilo packs his geography notebook into his backpack, zips it fully, and swings it onto his shoulders. He pushes his chair in and follows the tide of students into the hallway. Relief and energy wash over his face — school is done, and soccer practice awaits. The hallway fills with the roar of released teenagers.

### Scene 094: Retrieving the Soccer Bag
**Time:** 1:27 PM — bright hallway light
**Setting:** School hallway, at lockers
**Description:** Camilo jogs down the hallway to his locker, dodging slower-moving students. He spins the combination lock quickly — muscle memory — and yanks the locker open. The red drawstring soccer bag is wedged inside, the bulk of the cleats pressing against the locker door. He pulls it out and loops the string over his shoulder. He checks the locker one last time — a couple of notebooks remain for tomorrow — and slams it shut with a metallic bang. The lock clicks. He turns and heads for the school exit, the backpack on one shoulder, the soccer bag on the other, walking with the energetic stride of a teenager freed from class.

### Scene 095: Leaving School
**Time:** 1:30 PM — harsh afternoon sun
**Setting:** School gate, exiting
**Description:** Camilo passes through the school gate, stepping from the shaded courtyard into the full blast of the Barranquilla afternoon sun. The heat hits like a wall — it must be 35 degrees Celsius. He squints, shading his eyes with one hand. The street outside the school is busy with students dispersing, parents in cars picking up younger children, and a few food vendors selling cold drinks and fruit from pushcarts. Santiago walks beside him, their paths about to diverge. "See you tomorrow, parcero," Santiago says, using the Colombian slang for friend. Camilo gives him a fist bump and nods. "Nos vemos." Santiago turns left; Camilo turns right, heading home.

---

## PART 8: AFTER SCHOOL — WALKING HOME & LUNCH (1:30 PM - 3:15 PM)

### Scene 096: Walking Home in the Heat
**Time:** 1:32 PM — harsh afternoon sun
**Setting:** Residential street, Barranquilla
**Description:** Camilo walks home along the same route he took that morning, but now the street is different under the afternoon sun. The shadows have shrunk to almost nothing. Heat shimmers off the asphalt road. His white school shirt is bright in the sunlight, the backpack making his back sweat. The soccer bag hangs on his opposite shoulder. He walks in the narrow strip of shade along the house walls wherever possible. The mango tree from the morning still leans over the sidewalk, and he reaches up, plucking a small ripe mango from a low branch, tucking it in his pocket for later. A motorcycle buzzes past on the street. The air smells of warm concrete and tropical flowers.

### Scene 097: Arriving Home
**Time:** 1:40 PM — bright afternoon light
**Setting:** Front of house, entrance
**Description:** Camilo reaches his family's two-story house — pale yellow walls with a wrought-iron gate and a small front garden with tropical plants: a bougainvillea bush bursting with purple flowers, a croton plant with red and yellow leaves, and a small palm. He pushes open the metal gate, which squeaks on its hinges, and walks up the three tiled steps to the front door. The door is unlocked — mama is home from work early on school days. He pushes it open and steps into the cool interior, the ceiling fan in the entryway providing immediate relief from the outdoor heat. "Ya llegue!" he announces — I'm home!

### Scene 098: Dropping Bags in the Living Room
**Time:** 1:41 PM — indoor afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** Camilo drops his school backpack on the living room sofa — a plush brown couch with colorful throw pillows in Caribbean patterns. The red soccer bag lands beside it with a thud of cleats. The living room has pale green walls, a small television on a wooden stand, a glass coffee table with a vase of artificial tropical flowers, and a rocking chair in the corner — a Colombian classic, dark wood with a woven seat. Family photographs hang on the wall: Carlos and Diana's wedding, a baby Valentina, and a large print of Camilo in his soccer uniform holding a trophy. The tile floor is cool under his school shoes. From the kitchen, the sound of pots and his mother's voice calling: "Wash your hands, mijo, lunch is almost ready."

### Scene 099: Washing Hands at Kitchen Sink
**Time:** 1:42 PM — kitchen afternoon light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Camilo stands at the kitchen sink, turning on the faucet and pumping liquid soap onto his palms. He scrubs his hands under the running water, working the soap between his fingers and across his knuckles. The water runs slightly gray — a day of school, chalk dust, and courtyard soccer taking its toll. He rinses thoroughly, then shakes his hands over the sink before drying them on the kitchen towel hanging from a hook beside the sink. Diana stands at the stove behind him, stirring a pot of sancocho — a hearty Colombian soup — the thick broth bubbling with chunks of chicken, yuca, plantain, corn on the cob, and potato. The kitchen smells rich and savory.

### Scene 100: Changing Out of School Uniform
**Time:** 1:45 PM — bedroom afternoon light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom
**Description:** Camilo climbs the stairs two at a time and enters his bedroom. He unbuttons his white school shirt, pulling it off and hanging it on the desk chair to air out — he'll wear it again tomorrow if it stays clean. The navy pants get folded roughly and draped over the chair back. The black belt coils on the desk. He changes into home clothes: a loose gray cotton t-shirt and blue athletic shorts. He kicks off the school shoes and slides his feet into the blue chanclas waiting by the bed. The ceiling fan is on full speed, and he stands under it for a moment, arms out, letting the cool air dry the sweat from his back. The bedroom window is open, warm breeze mixing with the fan's current.

### Scene 101: Lunch with Mama
**Time:** 1:50 PM — kitchen afternoon light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Camilo sits at the kitchen table, now in casual clothes. Diana places a large bowl of sancocho in front of him — the steaming broth golden-yellow, a thick corn cob sticking up from the surface, chunks of yuca and plantain visible. A plate of white rice sits beside the bowl, along with a small dish of aji — spicy Colombian salsa made with cilantro, green onions, and hot peppers. Camilo spoons rice into the sancocho broth and stirs. He picks up the corn cob and bites off kernels, then uses a spoon to eat the yuca, blowing on it to cool it first. Diana sits across from him with her own bowl, watching him eat. "How was school?" she asks. "Good. We had a history quiz."

### Scene 102: Eating Sancocho
**Time:** 1:55 PM — kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, close-up at table
**Description:** Camilo lifts a spoonful of sancocho to his mouth — the broth thick with starch from the yuca and potato, a piece of shredded chicken balanced on the spoon. He slurps the hot broth, eyes closing briefly at the warmth and flavor. The corn cob on the edge of his bowl has been stripped of its kernels, the bare white cob remaining. He tears a piece of arepa from a basket on the table and dips it into the broth, soaking it golden before eating it. The aji dish has been spooned into his soup, adding a spicy kick — small green pepper flecks float in the broth. His glass of limonada — fresh limeade with a touch of panela sugar — sweats on the table beside his bowl.

### Scene 103: Valentina Joins for Lunch
**Time:** 2:00 PM — kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Valentina arrives home, bursting through the kitchen door with her school backpack bouncing. She drops it on the floor and slides into her chair at the table. Diana serves her a smaller bowl of sancocho. Valentina makes a face at the yuca pieces — "No me gusta la yuca, ma." Diana gives her a look that means she'll eat it anyway. Camilo grins at his sister across the table, chewing. "Eat it, enana, it makes you strong," he teases. Valentina sticks her tongue out at him for the second time today. Diana sighs, smiling faintly. The kitchen is warm with afternoon light and the steam from the soup pot on the stove.

### Scene 104: Helping Clear the Table
**Time:** 2:10 PM — kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table and sink
**Description:** Camilo pushes back from the table, stomach full. He stacks his empty bowl, plate, and glass and carries them to the sink, setting them carefully in the basin. He returns for the serving bowl and the arepa basket, placing them on the counter. Diana scrapes leftover sancocho into a storage container for Carlos's dinner later. Camilo turns the faucet on and begins rinsing the bowls, warm water cascading over the ceramic. He squirts dish soap onto a yellow sponge and scrubs the inside of his bowl. Diana dries beside him with a cotton dish towel. They work in easy rhythm, mother and son doing the familiar after-lunch routine.

### Scene 105: Homework at the Desk
**Time:** 2:20 PM — bright afternoon light through window
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo sits at his small wooden desk, the chair pulled close. He opens his school backpack and pulls out the math textbook, geography notebook, and the English notebook. He starts with math — the subject he finds easiest. The textbook is open to a page of algebra problems, and he copies each problem into his notebook, working through the solutions with his blue pen. His pencil case is open on the desk, pens and pencils splayed out. The ceiling fan spins above, ruffling the textbook pages slightly. Through the open window, he can hear children playing in a nearby street, their shouts carrying on the warm afternoon air. A glass of water from the kitchen sits on the desk corner.

### Scene 106: Solving Math Problems
**Time:** 2:30 PM — bright afternoon light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, close-up on desk
**Description:** Camilo's pen moves across the notebook page, writing numbers and algebraic symbols. He works through a problem: factoring an equation, writing each step neatly below the last. His left hand holds the textbook page flat while his right hand writes. He pauses at one problem, brow furrowing. He erases his work with a rubber eraser, blowing the pink eraser shavings off the notebook, and starts the problem over. This time the solution comes — he writes the answer and circles it. The desk surface around him shows the organized tools of a student at work: open textbook, notebook, pen, eraser, and the half-empty glass of water.

### Scene 107: Geography Homework — Map Questions
**Time:** 2:45 PM — afternoon light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo switches to geography, sliding the math textbook aside and opening the geography notebook. The homework asks five questions about the Colombian Caribbean coast — the topic from today's class. He reads the first question: "Name three major rivers that flow into the Caribbean Sea from Colombia." He flips through the geography textbook, finding the relevant map, and traces the rivers with his finger before writing: "Magdalena, Sinu, Atrato." His handwriting is faster now, less careful — he wants to finish before soccer practice. The geography textbook shows colorful maps of Colombia's regions, each department labeled in small text.

### Scene 108: Writing English Sentences
**Time:** 3:00 PM — afternoon light, shifting
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo opens his thin English notebook to start the assignment — ten sentences about his family. He writes slowly, sounding out words under his breath. "My father name is Carlos. He work at the port." He pauses, consulting the English textbook for vocabulary. He crosses out "name" and writes "name's" above it — remembering the possessive form. "My mother is Diana. She is a school administrator." The English comes harder than Spanish or math; he chews his pen cap between sentences. Six sentences done. He checks his phone — 3:05 PM. Practice is at 3:30. He writes two more sentences quickly, saves the last two for later, and closes the notebook. Good enough for now.

### Scene 109: Packing for Soccer Practice
**Time:** 3:10 PM — afternoon light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at foot of bed
**Description:** Camilo pulls the red drawstring soccer bag from where he dropped it on the living room sofa earlier (he ran upstairs to grab it). He checks the contents: the red and white Junior de Barranquilla jersey, black shorts, shin guards, long soccer socks. He adds a clean towel rolled tight, his water bottle refilled from the kitchen, and a small stick of sunscreen — the Barranquilla sun is brutal during afternoon practice. The cleats are still inside from that morning's packing. He pulls the drawstring tight and sets the bag on his bed. He's already wearing shorts and a t-shirt — he'll change into his soccer gear at the field. He grabs his phone and earbuds from the desk and slides them into his pocket.

### Scene 110: Heading Out for Practice
**Time:** 3:15 PM — hot afternoon sun
**Setting:** House entryway, front door
**Description:** Camilo comes downstairs with the soccer bag over his shoulder. He's in his gray t-shirt, blue shorts, and chanclas — he'll change into cleats at the field. Diana stands in the kitchen doorway. "Be careful on the bus. Call me when you get to practice." He nods, grabbing a banana from the fruit bowl on the kitchen counter and peeling it as he walks. "Chao, ma." He opens the front door and the afternoon heat rushes in. The sun is still high, the shadows short. He takes a bite of the banana, steps onto the porch, pulls the gate shut behind him, and walks toward the bus stop at the corner, two blocks away.

---

## PART 9: SOCCER PRACTICE (3:15 PM - 5:45 PM)

### Scene 111: Waiting at the Bus Stop
**Time:** 3:18 PM — hot afternoon sun
**Setting:** Bus stop, street corner
**Description:** Camilo stands at the bus stop — a simple metal pole with a small rectangular sign that reads "Transmetro" and shows the route number. There is no shelter, just the pole and a painted line on the curb. He finishes the banana and drops the peel into a nearby trash can. Two other people wait: an older woman with a shopping bag and a man in work clothes. Camilo puts in his earbuds and plays music on his phone — reggaeton, the bass thumping softly from the small speakers. He bobs his head to the rhythm, soccer bag at his feet. The street buzzes with afternoon traffic: motorcycles, buses, taxis, a donkey cart loaded with watermelons.

### Scene 112: Boarding the Bus
**Time:** 3:25 PM — inside bus, harsh light
**Setting:** Public bus
**Description:** A large public bus rumbles to the curb, brakes squealing. The bus is painted in bright colors — blue body with yellow and red stripes — and cumbia music plays from the driver's radio. Camilo picks up his soccer bag and climbs the three steps into the bus, depositing coins into the fare box with a metallic clink. The bus interior is warm, the windows open but providing little relief. Plastic seats in rows, some cracked, most occupied. Camilo moves to the back and grabs a metal pole, standing — no seats available. The bus lurches forward, and he sways with the motion, soccer bag wedged between his feet on the floor. The city scrolls by through the windows: storefronts, palm trees, traffic, billboards.

### Scene 113: Riding the Bus
**Time:** 3:30 PM — bus interior, moving
**Setting:** Public bus, standing
**Description:** Camilo rides the bus for fifteen minutes, one hand gripping the overhead metal bar, the other holding his phone. He watches the Barranquilla streets pass through the open window — the bus moves through a commercial district with tiendas, pharmacies, a small park with a fountain, a church with white stucco walls and a bell tower. The bus stops and starts frequently, picking up and dropping off passengers. The air through the windows is hot but creates a breeze. Camilo's t-shirt flutters. His earbuds play music, but he keeps one ear open, listening for his stop. A street vendor hops on the bus at a red light, selling bags of cold water: "Agua, agua fria!" Camilo buys one for 500 pesos and drinks it in three gulps.

### Scene 114: Getting Off at the Field
**Time:** 3:40 PM — hot afternoon sun
**Setting:** Bus stop near soccer field
**Description:** Camilo pulls out his earbuds and hits the buzzer strip on the bus wall. The bus slows, and he hops down the back steps onto the sidewalk, soccer bag bouncing on his shoulder. The bus rumbles away, exhaust trailing. He's in a different part of Barranquilla now — a sports zone with a small stadium visible down the road. The soccer club's facility is through a chain-link gate fifty meters ahead. A sign on the gate reads "Club Deportivo Junior — Cantera" in red and white letters — Junior's youth academy. Two other boys in red and white practice jerseys walk ahead of him through the gate. Palm trees line the entry path, their fronds rustling in a rare breeze.

### Scene 115: Arriving at the Practice Field
**Time:** 3:42 PM — bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Soccer field entrance
**Description:** Camilo walks through the club gate and down a short concrete path to the practice fields. The main field stretches out before him — vivid green natural grass with freshly painted white lines marking the sidelines, center circle, penalty boxes, and corner arcs. Two metal goal posts stand at each end, white nets hanging loosely. Orange cones are already set up in a line down the middle of the field for drills. The team bench — a long metal bench with a canvas shade canopy — sits on the near sideline, several water bottles and sports bags already placed on it. Floodlight poles tower at the four corners of the field, dormant in the afternoon sun. Beyond the far fence, tall palm trees sway against the Caribbean blue sky.

### Scene 116: Greeting Teammates
**Time:** 3:44 PM — bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline, at bench
**Description:** Camilo drops his soccer bag on the team bench and greets his teammates with handshake-fist bump combos and back slaps. About ten boys have already arrived, most in red and white practice jerseys, stretching or juggling balls on the sideline. "Quiubo, parcero!" — What's up, bro — they call to each other. Camilo recognizes every face: these are boys he's trained with for two years. A tall boy with a shaved head bounces a ball from knee to knee. Two others do partner stretches on the grass. The coach hasn't arrived yet; the boys' energy is loose and unstructured, balls flying in all directions.

### Scene 117: Changing into Soccer Gear
**Time:** 3:46 PM — sideline shade
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline, at bench
**Description:** Camilo sits on the metal bench and opens his red drawstring bag. He pulls out the red and white Junior de Barranquilla jersey and tugs it on over his t-shirt — then reconsiders, pulls both off, and puts on just the jersey, the lightweight polyester cooler against his skin in the heat. The jersey has the number 10 on the back. He swaps his blue shorts for the black soccer shorts, using a towel as a shield for privacy. Then the long red soccer socks, pulled up to just below the knee. The white plastic shin guards slide inside the socks, snug against his shins. Finally, the cleats — he sits on the bench and pulls them on, tugging the laces tight and tying secure double knots. He stamps each foot on the ground twice, testing the fit.

### Scene 118: Lacing Up Cleats
**Time:** 3:48 PM — sideline shade
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline, close-up on feet
**Description:** Close-up of Camilo's hands working the laces of his soccer cleats. The shoes are black with white accents, the soles studded with molded rubber cleats caked with dried mud from previous practices. He pulls each lace through the eyelets methodically, crossing them tightly, then ties a firm double knot at the top. The red soccer socks are pulled smooth beneath the shin guards, not a wrinkle. His feet look ready — the cleats molded to his foot shape from months of use. He flexes his ankle, testing range of motion, then stands and bounces on his toes on the grass. The cleats grip the turf with satisfying traction. The grass is slightly dry from the afternoon heat but still green and firm.

### Scene 119: Applying Sunscreen
**Time:** 3:50 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline
**Description:** Camilo squeezes a line of sunscreen from the small tube onto his palm and rubs it across his face — forehead, cheeks, nose, the back of his neck. The white cream leaves visible streaks on his light brown skin before he rubs it in with circular motions. He squints one eye shut as sunscreen gets too close. Then he applies some to his forearms and the exposed skin above his socks. The Barranquilla sun at this hour is punishing — UV index probably near 11. The tube goes back in the sports bag. A teammate mimics him, applying his own sunscreen. The coach has arrived — a stocky man in his 40s with a Junior de Barranquilla coaching shirt and a whistle on a lanyard around his neck. He carries a mesh bag of soccer balls and a clipboard.

### Scene 120: Coach's Arrival and Team Gathering
**Time:** 3:55 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** Soccer field, center circle
**Description:** The coach blows his whistle — two sharp blasts. The boys jog over from the sideline, forming a loose circle around him at the center of the field. Fifteen players total, all in red and white jerseys, ages 13 to 15. The coach — Coach Ramirez, stocky, tanned, with a no-nonsense expression — holds his clipboard and addresses the team. "Vamos, muchachos. Today we work on passing and positioning. Then a scrimmage." He claps his hands once. The boys listen, some bouncing on their toes. Camilo stands in the front of the circle, arms crossed, focused. The afternoon sun casts their shadows long on the green grass. The palm trees beyond the fence stand motionless in the still air.

### Scene 121: Warm-Up Jog Around the Field
**Time:** 3:58 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** Soccer field, perimeter
**Description:** The team begins with two laps around the perimeter of the field at a light jog. Camilo runs in a pack with his teammates, cleats digging into the grass, the group moving together. The field is standard size — it takes a couple of minutes to complete a lap. Sweat begins immediately in the Caribbean heat. The boys jog past the goal posts, their white nets swaying slightly. Past the corner flags — small red triangular flags on thin poles. Along the far sideline, where the chain-link fence borders the road. Around the second goal and back. The coach watches from the center, stopwatch in hand. The floodlight poles cast thin shadows across the grass.

### Scene 122: Dynamic Stretching
**Time:** 4:02 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** Soccer field, near sideline
**Description:** The team lines up in two rows facing each other for dynamic stretches. Camilo leads the line on one side. High knees — lifting each knee to waist height while walking forward. Butt kicks — heels flicking up to touch the back of his shorts. Lateral shuffles — sliding sideways across the grass, feet never crossing. Leg swings — holding a teammate's shoulder for balance while swinging each leg forward and back. The grass is slightly crunchy under their cleats. Drops of sweat fall from Camilo's forehead onto the green blades. The coach walks between the rows, correcting form: "Knees higher, David! Camilo, good!"

### Scene 123: Ball Control Drill — Juggling
**Time:** 4:08 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** Soccer field, scattered across field
**Description:** Each player has a ball now, pulled from the coach's mesh bag. Camilo stands in an open area of the field, juggling the soccer ball — bouncing it from right foot to left foot to right thigh to left thigh, keeping it in the air. The ball rises and falls rhythmically, never touching the ground. His eyes track the ball, his body making constant micro-adjustments. He counts under his breath: "...dieciocho, diecinueve, veinte..." Twenty juggles without a drop. Around him, teammates juggle with varying degrees of skill — some keeping the ball up easily, others chasing after mis-kicks across the grass. The coach circulates, offering tips. "Use the top of the foot, not the toe!"

### Scene 124: Passing Drill — Pairs
**Time:** 4:15 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** Soccer field, between orange cones
**Description:** The coach sets up a passing drill between orange cones placed ten meters apart. Players pair up. Camilo faces his partner — a stocky boy named Diego — and passes the ball firmly with the inside of his right foot. The ball rolls straight and true across the grass, hitting Diego's foot perfectly. Diego controls it and passes back. They alternate feet: right, left, right, left. The coach insists on two-touch play — one touch to control, one to pass. Camilo's passes are crisp, the ball spinning slightly backward on the grass. The sound of balls being kicked fills the air — thump, thump, thump — fifteen pairs working simultaneously across the field.

### Scene 125: Triangle Passing Drill
**Time:** 4:25 PM — afternoon sun, shadows lengthening
**Setting:** Soccer field, midfield area
**Description:** Three orange cones form a triangle. Three players rotate positions at each cone, passing in sequence. Camilo receives a pass at one cone, takes one touch to set the ball, and plays a quick one-touch pass to the next player before sprinting to the open cone. The drill emphasizes first touch, quick decisions, and constant movement. Camilo's soccer intelligence shows — he anticipates where to move before the ball arrives. The coach watches this group closely, nodding. "Rapido, rapido! Move before the ball!" The grass is marked with cleat tracks from the running. Sweat drips from Camilo's chin, darkening the front of his red and white jersey.

### Scene 126: Dribbling Through Cones
**Time:** 4:35 PM — afternoon sun
**Setting:** Soccer field, between cone line
**Description:** A line of eight orange cones stands in a zigzag pattern. Players take turns dribbling through them at speed. Camilo approaches the first cone, tapping the ball with the outside of his right foot, then cutting sharply left with the inside of his left foot. He weaves through the cones fluidly — right, left, right, left — his hips shifting, shoulders faking. The ball stays close to his feet, never more than half a meter away. He accelerates through the last two cones and strikes the ball toward a mini-goal at the end. The ball hits the back of the net with a satisfying rustle. He jogs back to the line, clapping his hands once. The next player starts the run.

### Scene 127: Shooting Drill — On Goal
**Time:** 4:45 PM — sun lowering, golden light
**Setting:** Soccer field, penalty area
**Description:** The team lines up behind the penalty spot for a shooting drill. A goalkeeper crouches in goal — a tall boy with gloves and a different colored jersey. Camilo steps up to the ball, placed on the penalty mark. He takes two steps back, plants his left foot beside the ball, and strikes with his right instep — a clean, powerful shot aimed low and to the right corner. The ball rockets off his foot, the white and black panels blurring, and strikes the inside of the goal post before bouncing into the net. The goalkeeper dives but misses. Camilo pumps both fists and jogs away. Teammates in line clap. The coach notes something on his clipboard.

### Scene 128: Heading Practice
**Time:** 4:55 PM — golden afternoon light
**Setting:** Soccer field, near goal
**Description:** The coach tosses balls into the air for players to practice headers. Camilo positions himself in the penalty area, eyes tracking the ball as it arcs toward him. He plants his feet, bends his knees, and springs upward, meeting the ball firmly with his forehead — the flat area above the eyebrows. The ball redirects sharply downward toward the goal. His eyes stay open, neck muscles firm, the technique correct. The goalkeeper saves this one, palming it over the crossbar. Camilo lands and immediately readies for the next ball. The golden Caribbean sun has dropped lower, casting long shadows of the goal posts across the grass. Sweat runs down Camilo's temple.

### Scene 129: Water Break
**Time:** 5:00 PM — golden light
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline, at bench
**Description:** Coach Ramirez whistles for a water break. The team jogs to the sideline bench, grabbing water bottles. Camilo picks up his bottle and squeezes a long stream of water into his mouth, then pours some over his head. Water cascades down his black hair and face, dripping off his chin onto his jersey. The cool water feels like heaven in the heat. His jersey is completely soaked with sweat, the red and white fabric darkened. He breathes hard, hands on his knees, catching his breath. Other boys sprawl on the grass, passing bottles around. The coach reviews his clipboard, making notes. A slight breeze finally stirs the palm trees beyond the fence. Five thirty PM approaches — scrimmage time.

### Scene 130: Scrimmage Begins — Kickoff
**Time:** 5:05 PM — golden hour light
**Setting:** Soccer field, center circle
**Description:** The coach divides the team into two groups: one in their red jerseys, the other wearing yellow pinnies (mesh training vests) pulled over their jerseys. Camilo is on the red team, positioned in attacking midfield — his natural position. The ball is placed at the center spot. The coach blows his whistle — a single long blast. A red-team player taps the ball to Camilo, who immediately passes it wide to a winger on the right side. The scrimmage is on. Bodies move across the grass in patterns, calls ring out — "Aqui! Pasala! Centro!" The golden hour light bathes the field in warm tones, long shadows stretching from every player.

### Scene 131: Dribbling Past a Defender
**Time:** 5:10 PM — golden hour light
**Setting:** Soccer field, attacking third
**Description:** Camilo receives a pass in the attacking third of the field, trapping the ball under his right foot. A yellow-pinnie defender closes in. Camilo drops his left shoulder as if going left, then pushes the ball right with the outside of his right foot — a body feint. The defender bites on the fake and shifts his weight wrong. Camilo accelerates into the space, the ball glued to his foot. He looks up, scanning the field — two teammates make runs toward goal. He picks out the striker with a through-ball, the pass splitting two defenders. The golden light catches the ball as it rolls across the green grass.

### Scene 132: Celebrating a Team Goal
**Time:** 5:15 PM — golden hour light
**Setting:** Soccer field, near goal
**Description:** The striker buries Camilo's pass into the bottom corner of the net. The red team erupts. Camilo sprints to join the celebration, arms raised. The scorer slides on his knees across the grass, arms spread wide. Camilo reaches him and jumps on his back in a joyful piggyback. Other teammates pile on — a laughing tangle of red jerseys and grass stains. The goalkeeper lies flat on his back, hands covering his face. The coach watches from the sideline, arms crossed, the faintest smile visible. The celebration lasts ten seconds before Coach Ramirez blows his whistle. "Reset! Yellow ball!" Play resumes.

### Scene 133: Defensive Recovery Run
**Time:** 5:20 PM — golden-orange light
**Setting:** Soccer field, midfield
**Description:** The yellow team counters quickly. Camilo sprints back from the attacking position, legs pumping, recovering defensively. His breath comes in sharp gasps. He tracks the opposing midfielder who carries the ball toward goal. Camilo closes the gap, timing his challenge — he slides in from the side, left foot extended, and pokes the ball away cleanly. The ball rolls to a red teammate. Camilo pops up from the slide, grass stains on his shorts and hip, and jogs back into position. His face is flushed, chest heaving, but his expression is determined. The sky behind the palm trees is turning orange and pink as the sun drops lower.

### Scene 134: Corner Kick
**Time:** 5:25 PM — orange-pink sunset light
**Setting:** Soccer field, corner arc
**Description:** Camilo jogs to the corner arc to take a corner kick. He places the ball carefully on the painted white quarter-circle, positioning it on the grass. He steps back three paces, eyes scanning the penalty area where teammates jostle with defenders for position. He raises his right hand — the signal to his team. Then he approaches the ball and curls it inward with the inside of his right foot. The ball arcs high through the warm evening air, bending toward the near post. A teammate rises above his marker and heads the ball down — but it bounces off the crossbar and out. Groans from the red team. Camilo claps his hands: "Next time!" The corner flag flutters from the spin of the passing ball.

### Scene 135: Free Kick Attempt
**Time:** 5:30 PM — sunset light
**Setting:** Soccer field, twenty meters from goal
**Description:** A foul is called — yellow team handled the ball. Free kick, twenty meters from goal, slightly left of center. Camilo places the ball on the spot the coach indicates. Three yellow-pinnie players form a wall, arms linked, feet together. The goalkeeper bounces on the goal line, clapping his gloves. Camilo takes four steps back and two to the right. He eyes the top right corner of the goal — the gap above the wall. He runs forward and strikes the ball with his right instep, following through high. The ball rises over the wall, bending slightly, and sails just wide of the right post, hitting the side netting. Close. Camilo puts his hands on his head in frustration. "Casi!" — Almost!

### Scene 136: End of Scrimmage — Coach's Talk
**Time:** 5:35 PM — dusk, fading orange light
**Setting:** Soccer field, center circle
**Description:** Coach Ramirez blows three sharp whistles — the signal for end of play. The boys stop where they are, hands on knees, catching breath. They walk toward the center circle, some flopping onto the grass. Camilo stands, hands on hips, chest rising and falling rapidly. The coach addresses the group: "Good intensity today. Camilo, your through-balls were excellent. Diego, work on your first touch. Everyone, we have a match Saturday — bring your best." The boys nod, too tired to respond loudly. The sky above is a wash of orange, pink, and purple. The floodlights have not been turned on; the natural light is enough as dusk settles over the field.

### Scene 137: Cool-Down Stretches
**Time:** 5:38 PM — dusk light
**Setting:** Soccer field, center circle
**Description:** The team sits on the grass in a circle, legs spread for static stretches. Camilo reaches forward toward his right foot, holding the stretch for fifteen seconds. His hamstrings ache from the sprinting. Then the left side. Then butterfly stretch — soles of feet together, knees pressing toward the grass. The grass is cool now, slightly damp with early evening dew. Camilo pulls his right foot up behind him for a quad stretch, balancing on one leg. The sky darkens above the palm trees. The field is quiet except for the boys' heavy breathing and the distant sound of evening traffic. Mosquitoes begin to appear, buzzing near their sweaty skin.

### Scene 138: Removing Cleats and Shin Guards
**Time:** 5:42 PM — dusk
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline, at bench
**Description:** Camilo walks to the team bench and sits down heavily. He bends forward and unties his cleats, pulling each one off and setting them on the bench. His socks are soaked with sweat, the red fabric darkened to near-maroon. He rolls down each sock and slides out the shin guards — the white plastic warm and damp from three hours against his skin. The shin guards go in the sports bag. He peels off the wet socks and stuffs them in too. His bare feet touch the grass, cool and prickly. He wiggles his toes, sighing with relief. The chanclas come out of the bag, and he slides his feet into them. The jersey is drenched and sticks to his skin.

### Scene 139: Drinking Water After Practice
**Time:** 5:44 PM — dusk, deepening blue
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline
**Description:** Camilo drinks the rest of his water bottle in long, continuous swallows. The bottle empties and he squeezes it, the plastic crinkling. He tosses the empty bottle into his sports bag. A teammate offers him a second bottle from the communal supply on the bench. Camilo accepts with a nod and drinks half of that too, water running from the corners of his mouth. His face is flushed, hair plastered to his forehead, eyes bright with post-exercise endorphins. He pours the remaining water over his head and face, gasping as the cool water hits. His jersey drips. The first evening stars are visible in the darkening sky above the field.

### Scene 140: Packing Up at the Field
**Time:** 5:45 PM — dusk
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline
**Description:** Camilo packs everything back into the red drawstring bag: the wet jersey (balled up), shorts, shin guards, socks, cleats. He pulls the drawstring tight. The towel from the bag gets a final use — he drags it across his face and the back of his neck, wiping away sweat. Then that too goes in the bag. He pulls his gray t-shirt back on over his sweaty torso, the dry cotton feeling cool and clean. He checks his phone — three missed messages from mama asking if he's finishing up. He types a quick reply: "Ya salgo" — I'm leaving now. Teammates are dispersing, some getting into parents' cars, others heading to the bus stop.

### Scene 141: Saying Goodbye to Teammates
**Time:** 5:47 PM — dusk
**Setting:** Soccer field gate area
**Description:** Camilo walks toward the club gate with two teammates. They exchange fist bumps and shoulder slaps. "Buen entreno, parcero." — Good training, bro. The tall boy with the shaved head — Mateo, the team captain — reminds everyone: "Match on Saturday, nine AM sharp. Don't be late." Camilo nods, hooking the sports bag over his shoulder. He pushes through the chain-link gate, its hinges squeaking. The streetlights have just flickered on along the road, casting orange pools of light on the sidewalk. The evening air is finally beginning to cool, though it's still warm by any non-tropical standard. Insects buzz around the streetlights.

### Scene 142: Bus Ride Home
**Time:** 5:55 PM — evening, streetlights
**Setting:** Public bus, seated
**Description:** Camilo climbs onto the bus for the ride home, this time finding a window seat. He drops the sports bag on his lap and leans his head against the window frame, exhausted from practice. The bus interior lights are on now — yellow fluorescent tubes along the ceiling. Through the window, Barranquilla at evening: storefronts lit with neon signs, food carts with bare lightbulbs, people walking home from work, motorcycles weaving through traffic with headlights on. Cumbia music still plays from the driver's radio, but softer now. Camilo's eyelids droop. His muscles ache pleasantly — legs, core, shoulders. The bus sways gently, rocking him toward sleep. He forces his eyes open when his stop approaches.

### Scene 143: Walking Home from Bus Stop
**Time:** 6:10 PM — early evening, streetlights
**Setting:** Residential street
**Description:** Camilo walks the two blocks from the bus stop to his house. The neighborhood is different at evening — warmer lights spill from house windows, the smell of dinners being cooked floats from open doors. A television plays loudly in a nearby house, a telenovela's dramatic theme music audible from the street. The mango tree from the morning is a dark silhouette against the deep blue sky. A few neighbors sit on their front porches in rocking chairs, enjoying the slightly cooler evening air. "Buenas noches, Camilo!" an older woman calls from her porch. "Buenas, Dona Elena," he calls back. His legs are heavy but he walks with the easy stride of a satisfied athlete.

## PART 10: EVENING AT HOME (6:15 PM - 10:00 PM)

### Scene 144: Arriving Home — Evening
**Time:** 6:15 PM — evening, house lights
**Setting:** House entryway
**Description:** Camilo pushes open the front gate and walks up the steps. The porch light is on — a yellow bulb that attracts small moths circling in the warm evening air. He opens the front door and steps inside. The house is lit warmly: the living room lamp glows, the television is on showing a news program, and the kitchen light illuminates the hallway. Carlos sits in the rocking chair watching the news, still in his work shirt but with the top buttons undone, a glass of agua de panela — sugarcane water — on the side table. "Como te fue, mijo?" — How did it go, son? "Bien, pa," Camilo replies, dropping the sports bag by the stairs. "Good practice." Carlos nods. "Go shower, you smell like a goat."

### Scene 145: Heading Upstairs to Shower
**Time:** 6:17 PM — evening light, stairway
**Setting:** Stairway
**Description:** Camilo climbs the stairs slowly, legs heavier than this morning. His hand grips the wooden banister for support — three hours of running, drills, and scrimmage have taken their toll. The sports bag bumps against his hip with each step. The upstairs hallway is dim, lit by a single light from the bathroom. He can hear Valentina in her bedroom singing along to a song on her tablet — off-key and enthusiastic. He passes her open door and she calls out: "You're sweaty and gross!" without looking up. "Thanks, enana," he replies. He enters the bathroom and closes the door behind him.

### Scene 146: Pre-Shower — Removing Sweaty Clothes
**Time:** 6:19 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom
**Description:** Camilo pulls his gray t-shirt over his head, dropping it on the tile floor. It's damp with sweat. He adds his blue shorts to the pile. The dirty clothes form a small heap by the door. He hangs a fresh blue towel on the towel hook — the one he uses after practice. The bathroom mirror shows his reflection: light brown skin with the faint imprint of the soccer jersey's collar, hair messy and flattened by sweat, sunscreen residue mixing with dried perspiration. He turns on the shower faucet, testing the water temperature with his hand under the stream. The water runs cool at first, then warm. Steam begins to rise in the small bathroom.

### Scene 147: After the Shower
**Time:** 6:30 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom
**Description:** Camilo stands at the sink wrapped in the blue towel from the waist down, hair dripping wet, water beading on his shoulders and chest. The bathroom mirror is fogged from the shower steam, and he wipes a clear circle on the glass with his palm to see his reflection. His skin looks clean and refreshed, the sunscreen and sweat all washed away. He picks up the comb and runs it through his wet hair, slicking it back from his forehead. Without gel, his natural wave is more visible. He applies deodorant again — clean routine after every shower. The pile of sweaty clothes on the floor will go in the laundry basket downstairs.

### Scene 148: Getting Dressed — Casual Evening Clothes
**Time:** 6:33 PM — bedroom light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom
**Description:** Camilo walks into his bedroom in the blue towel. The ceiling fan greets him with cool air. He opens the closet and pulls out clean clothes for the evening: a navy blue t-shirt with a small Nike logo and a pair of gray cotton basketball shorts. He pulls them on, the clean fabric soft against his shower-fresh skin. The blue chanclas go back on his feet. He tosses the used towel over the desk chair. He looks at himself briefly in the small mirror on the closet door — clean, comfortable, relaxed. His phone buzzes on the nightstand where he left it charging: a message from Santiago about tomorrow's history project. He picks it up and types a quick reply, then heads downstairs.

### Scene 149: Watching TV with Papa
**Time:** 6:40 PM — living room, evening
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** Camilo drops onto the brown sofa beside his father, tucking one leg under him. Carlos has switched the television from news to a sports channel — a pre-match analysis show for the upcoming Copa Libertadores game. The screen shows highlights, player statistics, and animated tactical formations. Carlos and Camilo watch together, commenting. "Look at that defense — terrible," Carlos says, shaking his head. Camilo agrees: "They need to press higher." The living room is comfortable: the soft sofa, the rocking chair, the coffee table with Carlos's empty glass and a Colombian newspaper folded to the sports section. The framed family photos on the wall glow warm under the lamp.

### Scene 150: Valentina Asks for Help with Homework
**Time:** 6:50 PM — living room light
**Setting:** Living room, at coffee table
**Description:** Valentina appears with her school notebook, standing in front of the TV and blocking the screen. "Camilo, help me with math. I don't understand fractions." Camilo groans but sits forward on the sofa. "Move, I can't see the game." She doesn't move. Carlos intervenes: "Help your sister, mijo." Camilo sighs and takes the notebook. Valentina sits cross-legged on the floor beside the coffee table. Camilo leans down from the sofa, pencil in hand, and begins explaining: "Look, a fraction is like cutting a pizza. If you have 3/4, you have three of the four slices." Valentina's brow furrows, then clears: "Oh! Like pizza!" The TV plays on, unwatched.

### Scene 151: Helping Valentina with Fractions
**Time:** 6:55 PM — living room light
**Setting:** Living room, at coffee table
**Description:** Camilo draws a circle on Valentina's notebook and divides it into eight equal slices with pencil lines. "Now shade in five slices," he instructs. Valentina picks up a colored pencil — purple, naturally — and carefully shades five sections. "So that's five-eighths," Camilo says, writing 5/8 beside the circle. "Now what's the fraction that's NOT shaded?" Valentina counts the empty sections with her finger: "Three. Three-eighths?" Camilo taps her notebook approvingly. "See, you're not bad at this." Valentina beams. Carlos watches from his rocking chair, a quiet smile on his face. The TV sports show hums in the background, forgotten.

### Scene 152: Mama Calls for Dinner
**Time:** 7:10 PM — kitchen light visible from hallway
**Setting:** Living room, toward kitchen
**Description:** Diana's voice carries from the kitchen: "A comer!" — Come eat! The smell of dinner has been building for the last hour — something rich and savory. Camilo hands Valentina's notebook back to her. "Finish the rest yourself, enana." He stands from the sofa, stretching his arms overhead. His stomach growls — three hours of soccer burned every calorie from lunch. Carlos folds his newspaper and rises from the rocking chair. Valentina scoops up her notebook and runs toward the kitchen. Camilo follows at a walk, pausing to turn off the TV. The living room goes quiet, the lamp casting a warm circle on the empty sofa.

### Scene 153: Dinner Table Setup
**Time:** 7:12 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** The kitchen table is set for four, just like breakfast but with a different feel — the evening light is warm from the overhead bulb, the window now dark with the night outside. A large oval serving plate in the center holds bandeja paisa-style portions: grilled carne asada strips, white rice, fried sweet plantains (tajadas) golden and glistening, a small bowl of frijoles — creamy red beans. A basket of warm arepas sits beside the meat. A pitcher of limonada with ice sweats on the table. Four plates, four glasses, four sets of silverware. The kitchen smells incredible — grilled beef, sweet plantains, fresh lime.

### Scene 154: Serving Dinner
**Time:** 7:14 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Diana uses tongs to place strips of grilled carne asada on each plate, the beef charred at the edges, pink in the center. She scoops white rice beside the meat, then adds three golden tajadas per plate — the sweet plantains caramelized and crispy. A ladle of frijoles goes into small bowls beside each plate. Camilo watches the food being served with hungry eyes, drumming his fingers on the table. Carlos reaches across to serve himself a warm arepa from the basket. Valentina picks up a tajada with her fingers and eats it before the serving is finished — Diana swats her hand gently. "Use your fork."

### Scene 155: Eating Dinner — Carne Asada
**Time:** 7:16 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, close-up on Camilo at table
**Description:** Camilo cuts into a strip of carne asada with his knife, the meat tender and yielding. He loads the fork with a piece of beef and a scoop of rice, eating with the focused appetite of a teenage athlete who just finished three hours of practice. The beef is seasoned with garlic and cumin, the outside smoky from the grill. He alternates bites: meat and rice, then a forkful of creamy frijoles, then a bite of sweet tajada. The flavors mix — savory, starchy, sweet, earthy. His glass of limonada is already half-empty. Across the table, Carlos eats at a more measured pace, while Valentina pushes her beans around her plate.

### Scene 156: Family Dinner Conversation
**Time:** 7:22 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, wide table view
**Description:** The family talks over dinner. Camilo describes practice — the scrimmage, his assist, the near-miss free kick. He uses his fork to gesture, nearly flinging rice. "And then I hit it right here" — he indicates the side of his foot — "and it bent just past the post." Carlos nods: "You need to aim more inside. Open your body to the target." He demonstrates with his knife hand. Diana talks about her day at the elementary school — a parent meeting that ran long. Valentina announces she got a gold star on her art project. The family eats, talks, laughs — the kitchen warm, the food shared, the evening intimate. Night insects chirp outside the dark window.

### Scene 157: Second Helping
**Time:** 7:30 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at table
**Description:** Camilo reaches for the serving plate and loads his plate with a second helping of rice, two more strips of carne asada, and another tajada. Diana raises an eyebrow. "Mijo, leave some for lunch tomorrow." Camilo grins guiltily but only puts back one strip of meat. He's still growing and always hungry after practice. His glass of limonada is refilled from the pitcher, the ice nearly melted now. Valentina has finished what she'll eat and sits swinging her legs under the table, watching her brother consume food at an alarming rate. Carlos takes his last bite and pushes his plate forward with a satisfied sigh.

### Scene 158: Clearing Dinner — Washing Dishes
**Time:** 7:40 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Camilo stands at the kitchen sink, sleeves of his t-shirt pushed up, scrubbing plates under hot running water. This is his evening chore — dishes after dinner. The yellow sponge works suds across the ceramic plates, the glasses, the forks and knives. He stacks clean dishes in the drying rack beside the sink — a wire rack where they air-dry in the tropical heat. Diana wraps leftover rice and meat in plastic containers for the refrigerator. Carlos dries the larger pots with a kitchen towel. Valentina sweeps the kitchen floor with a short broom, pushing crumbs toward the dustpan. The family cleans together, the kitchen gradually returning to order.

### Scene 159: Finishing English Homework
**Time:** 7:55 PM — bedroom, desk lamp
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo sits at his desk, the overhead light off, the small desk lamp casting a focused circle of yellow light on his English notebook. He returns to the assignment he started earlier — ten sentences about his family. He reads what he wrote: six sentences done. He picks up where he left off, writing carefully in English: "My sister Valentina is ten years old. She like to draw." He pauses, frowns, crosses out "like" and writes "likes" — remembering the third person S rule from class. "I play soccer every day. I love my family." Ten sentences, done. He reads through them once, checking for errors, then closes the notebook and stacks it on top of his other books. The desk lamp makes the soccer trophies on the shelf above gleam gold.

### Scene 160: History Project — Working on Timeline
**Time:** 8:10 PM — bedroom, desk lamp
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo opens his history notebook and begins work on the group project timeline Andrea assigned him. He draws a long horizontal line across two pages of the notebook, marking years from 1810 to 1830 at even intervals. At each date, he writes a short description of a key event in Colombian independence: "1810 — Grito de Independencia," "1813 — Bolivar's Campaña Admirable," "1819 — Batalla de Boyaca." He uses his history textbook as reference, flipping pages with one hand while drawing with the other. The timeline slowly fills with dates, names, and events. His handwriting is neat for this — it's a project that will be graded. The pencil scratches softly on the paper in the quiet bedroom.

### Scene 161: Taking a Phone Break
**Time:** 8:25 PM — bedroom, desk lamp and phone glow
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Camilo sets down his pencil and picks up his phone from the desk. He opens the team group chat: messages about Saturday's match — the lineup, the meeting time, who's bringing the extra water cooler. He scrolls through and adds a comment: a flexing arm emoji and "Vamos, Junior!" He switches to a soccer highlights account, watching a thirty-second clip of a spectacular bicycle kick. His eyes glow with the phone's blue light. The history project notebook lies open beside him, timeline half-finished. The desk lamp casts warm light on the page. He watches two more clips, then catches himself — he sets the phone face-down on the desk and picks up the pencil. Back to work.

### Scene 162: Finishing the Timeline
**Time:** 8:40 PM — bedroom, desk lamp
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, close-up on notebook
**Description:** Camilo adds the final entries to his history timeline: "1821 — Congreso de Cucuta, Constitution adopted" and "1830 — Gran Colombia dissolves." He draws small decorative borders around the timeline with his pencil — a thin double-line frame. In the corner, he writes his name, the date, and "Grupo: Andrea, Santiago, Camilo, Maria." He holds the notebook at arm's length, examining his work. The timeline stretches across both pages, neat and detailed, with twelve events marked and described. He nods, satisfied, and closes the notebook. Tomorrow he'll photograph it and send it to the group chat. He clicks off the desk lamp, and the room dims to the glow of the ceiling fan's nightlight.

### Scene 163: Watching Soccer on TV
**Time:** 8:50 PM — living room, evening
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** Camilo comes downstairs and finds Carlos already watching a live Copa Libertadores match on the television. The screen shows a packed South American stadium, green field blazing under floodlights, two teams battling in midfield. Camilo drops onto the sofa beside his father, pulling a cushion onto his lap. They watch intently — Carlos leans forward when a scoring chance develops, Camilo mirrors him. A cross comes in, a header, a diving save by the goalkeeper. Both of them groan, hands on heads. "That was a goal!" Camilo protests. Carlos shakes his head: "Great save." Diana passes through the living room carrying a basket of laundry, pausing briefly to glance at the screen. "It's just a game," she says. Father and son exchange a look of shared horror at this statement.

### Scene 164: Reacting to a Goal on TV
**Time:** 9:05 PM — living room, evening
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** The home team scores on TV — a screaming long-range shot that hits the top corner. Camilo leaps off the sofa, arms raised, shouting "GOOOL!" Carlos stands too, pumping his fist. The television shows the stadium crowd erupting, players sliding across the pitch in celebration. Camilo and Carlos exchange an enthusiastic high-five. The sofa cushion has fallen to the floor. From upstairs, Valentina yells: "SHUT UP, I'm trying to sleep!" Diana calls from the bedroom: "Lower the volume!" Camilo grabs the remote and lowers it one notch — barely perceptible. He and Carlos sit back down, grinning ear to ear, the excitement of the goal still buzzing.

### Scene 165: Discussing the Match with Papa
**Time:** 9:15 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** During halftime, Camilo and Carlos discuss tactics. Camilo sits sideways on the sofa, facing his father, gesturing with his hands to illustrate formations. "They're playing 4-3-3 but the left winger keeps drifting inside." Carlos nods, arms crossed: "That opens space on the flank for the fullback to overlap." Camilo's eyes light up — he grabs a pen from the coffee table and draws a quick formation diagram on the corner of Carlos's newspaper. Xs and Os and arrows. Carlos laughs: "You should be a coach." Camilo shakes his head: "A player first." The halftime graphics play on the muted TV. The living room is quiet except for their conversation, the rest of the house settling into sleep.

### Scene 166: Evening Snack — Fruit
**Time:** 9:25 PM — kitchen, evening
**Setting:** Family kitchen
**Description:** During a lull in the match, Camilo walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator. The interior light illuminates shelves of food: plastic containers of leftovers, a pitcher of juice, fruits, bottles of sauce. He grabs a mango from the fruit bowl on the counter — the one he picked from the tree that morning — and a small knife from the drawer. He stands at the counter, peeling the mango over the sink, the orange-yellow skin curling away under the blade. He slices thick pieces and eats them standing up, the sweet juice running down his chin. The mango is perfectly ripe — soft, fragrant, intensely sweet. He licks his fingers clean and rinses them under the faucet.

### Scene 167: End of the Match
**Time:** 9:40 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** The match ends with a 2-1 victory for the team Camilo and Carlos were cheering for. Camilo leans back on the sofa with a satisfied smile, hands behind his head. Carlos clicks off the TV with the remote. The screen goes black, and the living room is suddenly quiet — just the hum of the ceiling fan and the distant sound of night insects through the open window. "Good game," Carlos says, standing and stretching. "Time for bed, mijo. You have school tomorrow." Camilo nods but doesn't move yet, savoring the quiet. The living room lamp casts warm shadows on the walls. Through the window, the neighborhood is dark, only a few porch lights visible.

### Scene 168: Locking Up the House
**Time:** 9:42 PM — entryway, evening
**Setting:** House entryway and front door
**Description:** Carlos walks to the front door and turns the deadbolt lock — a heavy metal click. He checks the chain latch, sliding it into place. The porch light outside goes off with a switch by the door. Through the small glass panel in the door, the dark street is visible, streetlights casting pools of orange at intervals. Carlos checks the kitchen window — closed and latched. The back door — locked. The downstairs lights click off one by one: kitchen, hallway, living room. Only the stairway light remains, casting enough glow for Camilo to see as he picks up his soccer bag from where he dropped it hours ago and carries it upstairs.

### Scene 169: Brushing Teeth — Evening
**Time:** 9:45 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom
**Description:** Camilo stands at the bathroom sink for the second time today, green toothbrush in hand. He squeezes toothpaste onto the bristles and brushes — the same methodical routine as the morning, but slower now, his body tired. The mirror reflects a sleepy face: eyes slightly droopy, the energy of the day finally draining. He spits, rinses with water from the cup, and puts the toothbrush back in its slot in the cup holder. He splashes cold water on his face once — a final wake-up that quickly loses its effect. The bathroom light feels harsh against his tired eyes. He flicks it off and steps into the dim hallway.

### Scene 170: Changing into Sleep Clothes
**Time:** 9:48 PM — bedroom, low light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom
**Description:** Camilo enters his bedroom, the room lit only by the glow of the desk lamp he clicks on briefly. He pulls off his t-shirt and shorts, dropping them in the small laundry basket beside the closet. From the closet, he grabs his sleeping clothes: light cotton shorts and the same faded Colombia national team jersey from this morning, now washed and dried by Diana during the day — she must have put it back. The soft yellow fabric feels familiar and comfortable. He pulls on the shorts and jersey, the thin cotton perfect for sleeping in the Barranquilla heat. The ceiling fan is set to its highest speed, the blades a blur above.

### Scene 171: Setting the Alarm
**Time:** 9:50 PM — bedroom, low light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Camilo sits on the edge of his bed and picks up his phone from the nightstand. He opens the alarm app and checks that tomorrow's 6:00 AM alarm is set — the soccer ball icon still displayed. He plugs the phone into the white charging cable, the small LED on the phone showing a charging indicator. He sets the phone face-down on the nightstand beside the glass of water — refilled from the bathroom. The small digital clock shows 9:50 PM in red numbers. He looks at the phone one more time — a final check of the team chat: nothing new. He sets it down for the last time tonight.

### Scene 172: Pulling Back the Bedsheet
**Time:** 9:51 PM — bedroom, low light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Camilo pulls back the Colombia flag bedsheet and slides into bed. The sheet is cool against his legs — a small mercy in the tropical heat. He adjusts the pillow, folding it in half for extra height, then straightening it flat again. The mattress creaks softly under his weight. He lies on his back for a moment, staring up at the spinning ceiling fan, the blades casting faint shadows. The Messi poster on the wall above him is barely visible in the dim light. The soccer ball on the floor by the closet is a dark sphere in the shadow. The window is open, thin curtains barely moving in the still night air.

### Scene 173: Checking Phone One Last Time
**Time:** 9:53 PM — bedroom, phone glow
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Camilo picks up the phone one more time — the universal teenager struggle. The screen lights up his face in blue-white glow. He scrolls through a quick soccer highlight reel, watches a ten-second clip of a goal, then switches to his messages. A text from Santiago: "Did you finish the English homework?" Camilo types: "Yeah, all 10 sentences. You?" Santiago: "Only 6, help me tomorrow." Camilo sends a laughing emoji and types "Good night parcero." He sets the phone down, face-down, on the nightstand. The screen glow fades. The room returns to near-darkness, only the faint red glow of the clock and the silhouette of the ceiling fan.

### Scene 174: Papa Says Goodnight
**Time:** 9:55 PM — bedroom doorway, hallway light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, from doorway
**Description:** Carlos appears in the bedroom doorway, a silhouette against the hallway light. He leans against the door frame. "Buenas noches, mijo. Good practice today?" Camilo rolls onto his side to face the door. "Yeah, pa. Coach said my through-balls were good." Carlos nods. "Keep it up. Sleep well — big day tomorrow, always a big day." He reaches in and clicks off the desk lamp that Camilo left on. "Descansa." — Rest. He pulls the bedroom door mostly closed, leaving it ajar an inch. His footsteps retreat down the hallway. The sound of his parents' bedroom door closing, then quiet. The house settles into nighttime sounds: the ceiling fan, distant insects, the hum of the refrigerator downstairs.

### Scene 175: Lying in the Dark
**Time:** 9:57 PM — bedroom, near-dark
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, wide view
**Description:** Camilo lies on his side in the single bed, the Colombia flag bedsheet pulled up to his waist. His face rests on the folded pillow, eyes open, staring at the dim outline of the soccer trophies on the shelf across the room. The five small trophies catch the faintest glint of light from the window — starlight or distant streetlight. His mind replays moments from practice: the through-ball assist, the near-miss free kick, the coach's praise. His legs ache in a good way, the muscles tired from running. The ceiling fan hums its constant rhythm. Through the open window, a distant vallenato song plays from a neighbor's house — the accordion and guiro faint but recognizable.

### Scene 176: Rolling Over
**Time:** 9:59 PM — bedroom, near-dark
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Camilo rolls from his side onto his stomach, arms sliding under the pillow. The Colombia bedsheet rustles with the movement. His face turns toward the open window, where the thin curtains hang motionless in the still night air. The sky beyond is dark blue, a handful of stars visible past the glow of the city. A mosquito buzzes near his ear — he swats at it with a sleepy hand, missing. The ceiling fan keeps the worst of the mosquitoes at bay. His breathing slows, deepening. The digital clock on the nightstand blinks to 10:00 PM. Tomorrow it all begins again — alarm at six, school, practice, the rhythm of his days.

### Scene 177: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 10:00 PM — bedroom, dark
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, wide final view
**Description:** Camilo's bedroom is quiet and still. The boy sleeps in his single bed, face half-buried in the pillow, one hand tucked under his cheek. The Colombia flag bedsheet covers him from the waist down, the yellow, blue, and red stripes visible in the faint light. The faded Colombia jersey he wears as pajamas rises and falls with his slow, steady breathing. The ceiling fan spins endlessly overhead. On the shelf, the soccer trophies stand guard. On the floor, the soccer ball rests against the wall. The cleats — still in the red drawstring bag — wait by the foot of the bed. The phone charges silently on the nightstand, alarm set for six AM. The thin curtains frame a window full of tropical night sky. Another day in the life of Camilo — student, son, brother, soccer player — is complete.

## APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL LOCATION SCENES

### Scene 178: Morning Bedroom — Sunlight on Posters
**Time:** 6:10 AM — bright golden morning
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, wall detail
**Description:** Morning sunlight pours through the open window and falls directly onto the soccer posters on the opposite wall. The James Rodriguez poster — showing the Colombian star in his national team yellow jersey, ball at his feet — is lit golden. The Junior de Barranquilla team banner, red and white with the club crest, catches light along its top half. Small thumbtack holes and curling poster edges are visible up close. A piece of clear tape reinforces one corner of the Messi poster, which is slightly larger than the others. Beneath the posters, the light blue wall paint shows a few scuff marks from the soccer ball being kicked inside — evidence of indoor practice that mama has scolded Camilo about more than once.

### Scene 179: Bedroom — Trophy Shelf Close-Up
**Time:** 2:15 PM — bright afternoon
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, shelf detail
**Description:** The shelf above the desk holds Camilo's collection of soccer achievements. Five trophies of varying sizes: the tallest is a gold-painted plastic figure kicking a ball on a marble base — first place, Under-14 tournament, 2025. Two smaller silver trophies for second and third place finishes. A tiny trophy from his first tournament at age 9 — the golden figure barely taller than a thumb. The fifth trophy is a team award — a wider base with a group figure. Two bronze medals on red ribbons are draped over the corner of the shelf. A framed team photo shows fifteen boys in red and white jerseys, Camilo in the front row, crouching with a ball, grinning. Dust particles float in the beam of afternoon light.

### Scene 180: Bedroom — Desk at Night
**Time:** 8:30 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, desk detail
**Description:** The small wooden desk illuminated by the desk lamp shows the organized workspace of a student athlete. An open textbook — math — with its blue cover. A spiral notebook with the day's work, blue ink equations visible. The black pencil case unzipped, pens splayed across the desk. A small jar of hair gel pushed to the corner (migrated from the bathroom). The pencil cup with its assorted pens, pencils, eraser, and ruler. A few crumpled papers in a small wastebasket beside the desk. Underneath, the school backpack sits half-open, a notebook edge poking out. The desk lamp creates a focused warm circle of light, the rest of the room in shadow.

### Scene 181: Bathroom — Morning Light Through Window
**Time:** 6:25 AM — bathroom with morning light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, window detail
**Description:** The small bathroom window, positioned high on the wall near the ceiling, lets in the first morning light. The glass is frosted for privacy but allows a warm golden glow to mix with the overhead fluorescent. The windowsill — a narrow ledge of tile — holds a small potted aloe vera plant that Diana keeps for sunburn remedy (useful in Barranquilla). A few water droplets from the humidity cling to the inside of the glass. Through the frosted window, the blurred shapes of palm fronds and the pink-gold morning sky are visible. The chrome towel hook below the window holds the blue towel, perfectly placed.

### Scene 182: Bathroom — Toiletry Shelf Detail
**Time:** 6:28 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, shelf close-up
**Description:** The small shelf beside the bathroom mirror holds the family's toiletries in organized rows. Camilo's section: a blue teen deodorant stick, a small jar of hair gel with the lid slightly askew, a blue plastic comb with a few black hairs caught in the teeth. The toothbrush cup holds four toothbrushes in their assigned spots: green, pink, white, blue. A tube of toothpaste — white with blue stripes — stands upright, slightly squeezed in the middle (Camilo's habit; Diana prefers squeezing from the bottom). A bar of white soap in a ceramic dish sits on the shelf's edge. Everything is clean but lived-in, the small details of a family sharing one bathroom.

### Scene 183: Soccer Field — Arrival Overview
**Time:** 3:42 PM — bright afternoon
**Setting:** Soccer field, panoramic view
**Description:** A wide view of the practice field from the entrance path. The green grass stretches out in a perfect rectangle, the white lines crisp against the green. The two goals stand at each end — metal frames with white nets sagging slightly in the still air. The team bench on the near sideline is partially shaded by a canvas canopy. Orange cones dot the midfield in a training pattern. The floodlight poles rise at the four corners like sentinels. Beyond the far fence, palm trees create a green border against the brilliant Caribbean sky — a few white clouds floating high. A red and white team flag hangs limp on a small pole near the bench. The concrete equipment shed sits near the entrance, its metal door slightly open, soccer balls visible inside.

### Scene 184: Soccer Field — Cones and Equipment
**Time:** 4:00 PM — bright afternoon
**Setting:** Soccer field, sideline detail
**Description:** Close-up of the training equipment on the sideline. A row of ten orange cones stands in a straight line, their bright color vivid against the green grass. Beside them, a mesh bag holds eight white and black soccer balls, one spilling out onto the grass. A set of yellow pinnies — mesh training vests — lies folded on the team bench. The coach's clipboard rests on the bench beside a silver whistle on a black lanyard. Three water bottles — clear plastic with team stickers — stand upright on the bench. A small first-aid kit in a red pouch sits at the end of the bench. The grass near the bench is slightly worn from foot traffic, a bare patch of dirt visible.

### Scene 185: Soccer Field — Goal Close-Up
**Time:** 4:45 PM — golden afternoon
**Setting:** Soccer field, at goal
**Description:** Close-up view of the goal from inside the net looking outward. The metal crossbar and posts are painted white, chipped in places to show gray metal underneath. The white net hangs behind and below, creating a mesh curtain. The goal-line — a thick white painted stripe — stretches across the grass at the base. Inside the goal area, the grass is more worn than elsewhere, patches of bare dirt showing where the goalkeeper plants and dives. The penalty spot is visible twelve yards out — a white circle on the grass. Beyond, the field stretches to the far goal, players visible as small figures. The afternoon sun hangs low, casting golden light through the mesh of the net.

### Scene 186: Soccer Field — Palm Trees Beyond the Fence
**Time:** 5:30 PM — sunset
**Setting:** Soccer field, fence and backdrop
**Description:** The chain-link fence at the edge of the practice field, with palm trees rising beyond it. The fence is metal, slightly rusted in places, with a few spots where the chain link sags. Through the diamond-shaped gaps in the fence, tall royal palms stand in a line, their smooth gray trunks rising to feathery green crowns thirty feet above. The sky behind them blazes with sunset colors — deep orange, pink, and purple, the kind of sunset only the Caribbean produces. A few birds — frigatebirds with their distinctive forked tails — circle above the palms. The floodlight poles on the near side of the fence are still dormant, waiting for the light to fade enough to trigger them.

### Scene 187: Soccer Field — Scrimmage Action
**Time:** 5:15 PM — golden hour
**Setting:** Soccer field, midfield
**Description:** The scrimmage is in full swing. Camilo in his red jersey sprints across midfield, arm raised, calling for the ball. His cleats tear small divots in the grass. Around him, players in red jerseys and yellow pinnies move in patterns — attackers advancing, defenders retreating. The ball is in the air — a long pass from the defensive line. Camilo adjusts his run, tracking the ball's arc against the golden sky. He chests it down, the ball dropping perfectly to his feet. A defender closes in. The field is a blur of motion, color, and purpose. The coach watches from the sideline, whistle between his lips, arms crossed over his clipboard.

### Scene 188: Bedroom — Soccer Ball on Floor
**Time:** 6:05 AM — morning light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, floor level
**Description:** A low-angle view from the bedroom floor showing the white and black soccer ball resting against the light blue wall. The ball is well-used — the white hexagonal panels slightly scuffed and grass-stained, one black panel showing a faint scratch. The tile floor stretches around it, cream-colored and cool. Beyond the ball, the pair of black cleats sit by the bedroom door, laces untied, dried mud on the soles. The bed is visible in the background, the Colombia flag bedsheet hanging over the side. Morning light from the window casts a long shadow behind the ball. A single blade of grass — tracked in from practice — lies on the tile near the ball.

### Scene 189: Bathroom — Mirror After Shower
**Time:** 6:32 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** The bathroom mirror is fogged with shower steam, the glass opaque and white. A handprint-shaped clear spot shows where Camilo wiped the glass to see his reflection. Through the clear spot, part of his face is visible: one brown eye, his wet black hair combed flat against his forehead, a strip of light brown skin on his cheek. Water droplets slide down the mirror's surface in slow lines. The rest of the bathroom is a blur of blue and white tiles behind the steam. The toothbrush cup is visible at the edge of the clear spot, the four colored toothbrushes standing like sentinels. The overhead light creates a bright glare on the fogged surface.

### Scene 190: Soccer Field — Evening Floodlights
**Time:** 5:40 PM — dusk, floodlights
**Setting:** Soccer field, wide view
**Description:** The floodlights at the four corners of the field click on with a low electrical hum, their powerful white beams illuminating the grass in a sudden bright wash. The field transforms — the grass goes from golden-dusk green to vivid electric green under the artificial light. Player shadows stretch long and sharp on the turf, multiplied by the four light sources. The sky above is deep indigo, the first stars visible. The palm trees beyond the fence are silhouetted black against the twilight. The white goal nets glow bright under the lights. Moths and small insects appear instantly, spiraling in the light beams. The cool-down stretches continue under this new illumination, the field feeling like a stage.

### Scene 191: Bedroom — Backpack on Chair
**Time:** 7:50 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** The dark blue school backpack sits on the wooden desk chair, partially unzipped. The small Colombian flag patch on the top flap is visible — a simple red, blue, and yellow rectangle stitched onto the navy fabric. A textbook spine pokes out from the open zipper: "Ciencias Naturales 8" in white text on a green cover. A pen clip is visible clipped to the front pocket's zipper pull. The backpack straps drape over the chair's wooden arms. Beside the chair, on the desk surface, the black pencil case with its soccer ball design sits closed. The desk lamp illuminates the scene from above, casting the chair's shadow on the tile floor.

### Scene 192: Kitchen — Morning Fruit Bowl
**Time:** 6:38 AM — morning kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, counter detail
**Description:** The fruit bowl on the kitchen counter beside the refrigerator: a wide ceramic bowl painted with tropical flowers, filled with an assortment of Colombian fruits. Two ripe mangoes with red-gold skin, a bunch of small bananas (bananos) turning from green to yellow, three round passion fruits (maracuya) with wrinkled purple shells, a large papaya with orange-green skin, and two limes. The fruits are arranged naturally, some resting against others. A small fruit fly circles the mangoes. The ceramic bowl sits on a woven placemat on the yellow-tiled counter. Morning light from the kitchen window illuminates the fruit, making the colors vivid: gold, yellow, purple, orange, green.

### Scene 193: Kitchen — Refrigerator Magnets
**Time:** 6:49 AM — morning kitchen light
**Setting:** Family kitchen, refrigerator detail
**Description:** Close-up of the family refrigerator door covered with magnets and photos. A Junior de Barranquilla team magnet — the club crest in red and white — holds a practice schedule card. A small Colombian flag magnet sits near the top. A Carnival photo shows the family in colorful costumes: Carlos in a marimonda mask, Diana in a bright cumbia dress, young Camilo with face paint, baby Valentina in a flower crown. A postcard magnet from Cartagena's Old City shows the colorful colonial buildings. A magnetic notepad hangs at eye level with Diana's handwriting: "Buy: milk, eggs, arepas." A small round magnet shaped like a soccer ball holds a school grade report — Camilo's, with visible marks.

### Scene 194: Living Room — Evening TV Glow
**Time:** 9:10 PM — living room, TV glow
**Setting:** Living room, wide view
**Description:** The living room lit primarily by the television's glow. The screen shows a soccer match — the green field bright, players small figures on screen. Carlos and Camilo sit on the brown sofa, their faces illuminated by the changing light of the broadcast — blue for close-ups, green for wide shots, bright white for replays. The rocking chair in the corner is empty, its wooden form dark. The coffee table holds Carlos's empty glass and the folded newspaper. The family photographs on the wall reflect the TV's flickering light. The living room lamp is off, making the TV the room's sole light source. The ceiling fan is a dark shape spinning above, barely visible.

### Scene 195: Bedroom — Final Night View
**Time:** 10:00 PM — near-dark
**Setting:** Camilo's bedroom, from window
**Description:** Camilo's bedroom at night, viewed from the window looking inward. The thin curtains frame the scene. The boy sleeps in his bed, a still figure under the Colombia flag bedsheet. The ceiling fan spins in the darkness above. The nightstand holds the charging phone — its tiny LED the only pinpoint of light — and the digital clock glowing red: 10:00. The desk is a dark shape against the wall, the chair holding the sleeping backpack. The trophy shelf catches no light now, the gold figures invisible. The soccer ball on the floor is just a round shadow. The room is peaceful, warm, full of the quiet sounds of tropical night: the fan's hum, insects beyond the window, the distant murmur of the Caribbean city that never fully sleeps. Tomorrow, the alarm will sound at six, and the cycle begins again.
