# A Day in the Life of Dona Carmen: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Dona Carmen, a 75-year-old retired Colombian grandmother and artisan living in Villa de Leyva, Boyaca, Colombia.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Elderly character provides unique perspective on daily routines and traditional culture
- Artisan crafts vocabulary (weaving, pottery, yarn, loom, clay)
- Colombian highland (Boyaca) cultural context
- Multigenerational family dynamics (grandmother with visiting grandchildren)
- Pets woven naturally throughout the day (three cats)
- Objects shown in real-world settings within colonial architecture
- Catholic and traditional cultural practices embedded naturally
- Highland cuisine and food preparation vocabulary

## PART 1: PRE-DAWN — BEDROOM (5:00 AM - 5:20 AM)

### Scene 001: Pre-Dawn Bedroom
**Time:** 5:00 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, wide view
**Description:** A colonial bedroom in Villa de Leyva lies in deep pre-dawn darkness. Thick whitewashed adobe walls glow faintly blue in the moonlight seeping through heavy wooden shutters. A 75-year-old Colombian woman with silver-white hair in a bun sleeps in a large dark carved wooden bed under layered wool blankets in burgundy and cream, topped by a crocheted bedspread. A black cat, Negrito, is curled at the foot of the bed on the wool blankets. On the dark wooden nightstand, a framed black-and-white photograph of a man sits beside a small statue of the Virgin Mary draped with rosary beads. The reading lamp is off. Dark wooden ceiling beams cross overhead. The terra-cotta tile floor is cold and dark. A thick wool rug in warm brown and orange tones lies beside the bed.

### Scene 002: Waking Before Dawn
**Time:** 5:02 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Carmen stirs under the heavy wool blankets, her silver-white hair slightly loosened from the bun beneath a cream cotton sleep cap. She wears a cream-colored flannel nightgown with small floral print. One wrinkled hand emerges from under the burgundy blanket, reaching toward the nightstand. Her round gold-framed reading glasses sit folded beside the reading lamp. Negrito the black cat lifts his head at her movement, green eyes catching faint moonlight. The rosary beads on the Virgin Mary statue glint softly.

### Scene 003: Turning On the Lamp
**Time:** 5:04 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, nightstand close-up
**Description:** Carmen's weathered hand reaches for the reading lamp on the dark wooden nightstand, fingers finding the small switch. The lamp clicks on, casting a warm golden circle of light across the nightstand surface. The framed photograph of her late husband Don Eduardo — a kind-faced man in a teacher's suit — is illuminated. The small ceramic Virgin Mary statue stands beside it, ivory rosary beads looped over her clasped hands. A leather-banded wristwatch — Eduardo's — lies coiled beside the photo frame. Carmen's reading glasses case, dark brown leather, sits within reach.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 5:06 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen sits up slowly in the large carved wooden bed, pushing the crocheted bedspread and wool blankets down to her waist. Her cream flannel nightgown has a modest round collar with a small lace trim. The cotton sleep cap sits slightly askew on her silver-white hair. She puts on her round gold-framed reading glasses, adjusting them on her nose. Her small gold cross necklace rests against the nightgown fabric. Negrito the black cat stretches beside her legs, arching his back. The warm lamplight catches the deep lines around Carmen's eyes and mouth as she blinks awake.

### Scene 005: Morning Prayer in Bed
**Time:** 5:08 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen sits upright against the carved wooden headboard, hands clasped together in prayer, eyes closed. The rosary beads are now in her hands — cream-colored ivory beads with a small silver crucifix dangling between her fingers. Her lips move silently in morning devotion. The reading lamp casts warm light on her lined face. The Virgin Mary statue on the nightstand seems to watch over her. The crucifix on the whitewashed wall above the headboard is visible. Negrito has settled back down, curled into a black circle at the foot of the bed. The wool blankets are pulled up to her waist. The room is still and reverent.

### Scene 006: Finishing Prayer
**Time:** 5:12 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen kisses the small silver crucifix on the rosary, then carefully drapes the beads back over the Virgin Mary statue on the nightstand. Her eyes are open now, expression peaceful and composed. She touches the framed photograph of Don Eduardo with her fingertips — a brief, habitual gesture of remembrance. The leather watch beside the photo catches the lamplight. She takes a deep breath, preparing to rise. The heavy wooden shutters show the faintest blue-gray hint of approaching dawn through the gaps.

### Scene 007: Feet on the Floor
**Time:** 5:14 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, floor level
**Description:** Carmen swings her legs over the side of the large bed, her thick wool socks touching the warm wool rug on the terra-cotta tile floor. The crocheted bedspread drapes to the floor. She sits on the edge of the bed for a moment, one hand on the nightstand for balance, the other on the mattress edge. Her cream flannel nightgown falls to her ankles. The heavy dark wooden wardrobe stands against the opposite wall, its carved doors closed. Negrito drops silently from the bed and stretches on the rug, his black fur against the warm brown and orange wool.

### Scene 008: Putting on Slippers
**Time:** 5:15 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen slides her feet into worn leather house slippers that sit beside the wool rug. The slippers are dark brown, well-worn and shaped to her feet from years of use. She grips the nightstand edge as she stands, rising slowly with the careful movements of elderly joints. Her slightly stooped frame straightens as much as it will. The reading lamp throws her long shadow across the terra-cotta tiles toward the wooden wardrobe. Negrito weaves between her ankles, tail upright.

### Scene 009: Walking to the Wardrobe
**Time:** 5:16 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, mid-room
**Description:** Carmen walks slowly across the bedroom toward the heavy dark wooden wardrobe, slippers shuffling on the terra-cotta tiles. Her left hand trails along the dresser top for balance, fingers brushing the lace doily and the ceramic vase of dried lavender and wheat stalks. Negrito trots ahead of her, already at the wardrobe. The thick whitewashed walls glow warmly in the lamplight. Dark wooden ceiling beams create deep shadows overhead. Through the gap in the wooden shutters, the sky is shifting from black to deep indigo.

### Scene 010: Opening the Wardrobe
**Time:** 5:17 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at wardrobe
**Description:** Carmen pulls open the carved wooden wardrobe doors. Inside, her clothes hang neatly: several long cotton skirts in dark blue, brown, and black; white embroidered blouses on wooden hangers; wool cardigans in burgundy, forest green, and gray; a black wool shawl (ruana) folded on the shelf above. On the wardrobe floor sit two pairs of shoes — low black leather shoes and leather sandals. A stack of folded craft aprons sits beside the shoes. The wardrobe smells of cedar and dried lavender sachets that hang from the rod. Carmen reaches for a dark blue skirt and a white embroidered blouse.

### Scene 011: Selecting Clothes
**Time:** 5:18 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at wardrobe
**Description:** Carmen lays her selected clothes on the edge of the bed: a dark blue long cotton skirt, a white blouse with colorful Boyaca-style floral embroidery along the collar and cuffs (red, yellow, green flowers), and a burgundy wool cardigan. She also places a dark blue denim craft apron on top — she plans to weave this morning. The clothes are simple, well-made, and well-worn. The embroidery on the blouse is traditional Boyaca needlework, hand-stitched. Negrito sniffs at the clothes curiously before jumping back onto the warm spot Carmen left in the bed.

### Scene 012: Removing Sleep Cap
**Time:** 5:19 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at dresser mirror
**Description:** Carmen stands before the small oval mirror on the dresser, removing her cotton sleep cap to reveal her silver-white hair, still mostly held in the bun but with wisps loosened from sleep. She sets the sleep cap on the dresser beside the ceramic vase of dried flowers. Her reflection shows her lined face, round reading glasses, and the small gold cross necklace. She pulls a few hairpins from a small ceramic dish on the dresser and begins to tighten the bun, tucking in loose strands with practiced fingers. A tortoiseshell hair comb sits ready on the lace doily.

### Scene 013: Fixing Her Hair
**Time:** 5:20 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at dresser mirror
**Description:** Carmen's weathered hands work through her silver-white hair, gathering the loose wisps and pinning them neatly into the bun at the nape of her neck. She secures it with several dark hairpins from the ceramic dish, then slides the tortoiseshell decorative comb into place above the bun. Her movements are practiced and efficient — she has done this every morning for sixty years. The small oval dresser mirror reflects her satisfied expression. The dried lavender in the ceramic vase scents the air faintly. On the dresser, beside the mirror, sits a small framed color photo of her four grandchildren.

## PART 2: EARLY MORNING — BATHROOM (5:20 AM - 5:40 AM)

### Scene 014: Walking to the Bathroom
**Time:** 5:21 AM
**Setting:** Hallway between bedroom and bathroom
**Description:** Carmen walks down the narrow hallway of her colonial house, one hand trailing along the whitewashed wall for balance. The hallway has terra-cotta tile floors and dark wooden ceiling beams. A small framed painting of the Virgin of Chiquinquira hangs on the wall — the patron saint of Colombia. A single overhead light illuminates the corridor with warm yellow light. Her leather slippers make soft sounds on the tiles. Canela, the orange tabby cat, appears from the direction of the kitchen, meowing softly and rubbing against Carmen's ankles in greeting.

### Scene 015: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 5:23 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, doorway view
**Description:** Carmen enters the simple bathroom, flipping the light switch by the door. The overhead light illuminates white tile walls with a decorative blue-and-white azulejo tile border running at waist height — a colonial-style pattern of flowers and vines. The pedestal sink stands against one wall with a mirror above it. The toilet sits beside a metal grab bar bolted to the wall. The small shower area has a plastic curtain pulled back and another metal grab bar. A rubber non-slip bath mat covers the terra-cotta tile floor near the shower. A small wooden stool sits in the corner. White towels hang on a metal rack beside the sink. Canela tries to follow Carmen in but is gently blocked by the closing door.

### Scene 016: At the Sink
**Time:** 5:25 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen stands before the pedestal sink, looking at her reflection in the mirror. Her silver-white hair is now neatly pinned in its bun. She wears her cream flannel nightgown, thick wool socks, and leather slippers. She turns on the faucet — cold water first, then adjusting to warm — and cups her hands under the stream. A white ceramic soap dish holds a bar of lavender-scented soap. A floral hand towel hangs from a small hook beside the mirror. Her round reading glasses sit slightly lower on her nose as she leans forward. The blue-and-white azulejo tiles frame the mirror decoratively.

### Scene 017: Washing Face
**Time:** 5:26 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen splashes warm water on her face, eyes closed, the water running down her deeply lined cheeks. Her weathered hands cup the water carefully. Droplets cling to her reading glasses, which she has pushed up onto her forehead. The bar of lavender soap lathers in her hands as she gently washes her face. The floral hand towel is within reach on its hook. Water runs down the white pedestal sink into the drain. The mirror above is slightly fogged from the warm water. Her small gold cross necklace sways forward as she bends over the sink.

### Scene 018: Drying Face
**Time:** 5:27 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen pats her face dry with the floral hand towel, pressing the soft cotton gently against her wrinkled skin. She pulls her reading glasses back down onto her nose, adjusting them with one hand. Her face is clean and slightly pink from the warm water. She drapes the towel back on its hook and looks at herself in the now-clearing mirror. The bar of soap sits back in its ceramic dish, the lavender scent lingering. A small wooden shelf beside the mirror holds a plastic cup with her toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste, a comb, and a small bottle of face cream.

### Scene 019: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 5:28 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen squeezes toothpaste onto a soft-bristled toothbrush from the plastic cup on the wooden shelf. She brushes her teeth carefully, her reflection visible in the mirror. Her weathered hand holds the toothbrush with a steady grip. Beside the plastic cup on the shelf, a small covered container holds her partial denture cleaning supplies. The faucet runs gently as she brushes. The blue-and-white azulejo tile border is visible behind her in the mirror. She brushes methodically, the way one does after seventy-five years of practice.

### Scene 020: Rinsing and Spitting
**Time:** 5:30 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen cups water from the faucet in her hand and rinses her mouth, spitting neatly into the pedestal sink. She rinses once more, then turns off the faucet. She places the toothbrush back in the plastic cup on the shelf. She wipes her mouth with the floral hand towel. The sink is clean and white. She adjusts her reading glasses once more and straightens up, one hand on the sink edge for support. The small wooden stool in the corner holds a folded bath towel.

### Scene 021: Applying Face Cream
**Time:** 5:31 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen opens the small bottle of face cream from the wooden shelf, scooping a small amount onto her fingertips. She dabs the cream gently across her cheeks, forehead, and chin, working it into the deeply lined skin with small circular motions. Her reflection in the mirror shows the careful, gentle movements. The cream is a simple moisturizer in a white jar with a green label. She pays particular attention to the dry skin around her eyes and mouth. The bathroom light catches the gold frames of her reading glasses as she tilts her head to check her work.

### Scene 022: Combing Hair Check
**Time:** 5:33 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Carmen takes the small comb from the wooden shelf and runs it gently along the edges of her hair near her temples, smoothing any strands that escaped during face-washing. The silver-white hair is pulled neatly into the bun, secured with hairpins and the tortoiseshell comb. She turns her head left, then right, checking in the mirror. Satisfied, she replaces the comb on the shelf. The mirror reflects the blue-and-white azulejo tiles behind her and the grab bar beside the toilet. Everything is orderly and in its place.

### Scene 023: Changing Out of Nightgown
**Time:** 5:35 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at wooden stool
**Description:** Carmen sits on the small wooden stool in the bathroom corner, having brought her day clothes from the bedroom. She has already changed from her nightgown into her white embroidered blouse and dark blue long cotton skirt. The cream flannel nightgown is folded neatly on her lap. She reaches down to swap her thick wool socks for thinner cotton ones and slides her feet into the low black leather shoes she carried in. The folded nightgown, sleep cap, and wool socks sit in a tidy pile on the stool. The grab bar on the wall beside her provides support.

### Scene 024: Final Mirror Check
**Time:** 5:38 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Carmen stands before the bathroom mirror for a final check. She wears her white blouse with the colorful Boyaca floral embroidery along the collar and cuffs — red, yellow, and green flowers stitched in traditional patterns. The dark blue cotton skirt falls to her ankles. Her small gold cross necklace sits at the collar of the blouse. The round reading glasses are clean on her face. She smooths the blouse front with her hands, then straightens the small gold earrings she put on — simple studs that she wears daily. Her expression is composed and ready. She gathers the folded nightclothes under one arm.

### Scene 025: Leaving the Bathroom
**Time:** 5:40 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, doorway
**Description:** Carmen opens the bathroom door, nightclothes folded neatly under her arm. Canela the orange tabby is sitting just outside the door, tail curled around her paws, waiting patiently. The cat meows and stands, rubbing against Carmen's dark blue skirt. Carmen smiles down at the cat. The hallway stretches toward the kitchen, where the faintest gray light is beginning to show through a distant window. The overhead hallway light casts warm yellow light on the whitewashed walls and the framed painting of the Virgin of Chiquinquira. Carmen shuffles toward the bedroom to put away her nightclothes before heading to the kitchen.

## PART 3: EARLY MORNING — KITCHEN AND COURTYARD (5:40 AM - 7:00 AM)

### Scene 026: Putting Away Nightclothes
**Time:** 5:41 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at wardrobe
**Description:** Carmen opens the dark wooden wardrobe and places the folded cream nightgown, sleep cap, and wool socks on a shelf inside. The wardrobe interior is neat — skirts on one side, blouses on the other, sweaters folded on shelves, the black ruana shawl on the top shelf. Cedar sachets hang from the rod, their woody scent mixing with dried lavender. Negrito still occupies the warm center of the bed, not planning to move. Carmen closes the wardrobe doors gently, the carved wood clicking softly. She turns off the reading lamp on the nightstand — the bedroom now lit only by growing pre-dawn light filtering through the wooden shutters.

### Scene 027: Walking to the Kitchen
**Time:** 5:43 AM
**Setting:** Hallway to kitchen
**Description:** Carmen walks the short hallway from her bedroom past the living room toward the kitchen. The colonial house has thick whitewashed walls, dark wooden doors with iron hardware, and terra-cotta tile floors throughout. She passes a dark wooden console table with a ceramic bowl holding keys and a small potted succulent. A framed family photograph — her children and grandchildren at a birthday celebration — hangs above the console. Canela the orange tabby trots ahead of her, tail high, knowing the kitchen means breakfast. The gray-and-white cat Michi appears from the living room, stretching in the hallway, also heading kitchen-ward.

### Scene 028: Entering the Kitchen
**Time:** 5:45 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, doorway view
**Description:** Carmen enters her kitchen, turning on the overhead light. The kitchen is modest but well-kept: whitewashed walls, dark wooden open shelving holding ceramic plates, bowls, and cups in earthy colors. A gas stove with four burners sits against one wall, a blue ceramic tile backsplash behind it. A small old refrigerator hums in the corner. A dark wooden kitchen table with two chairs sits by the window, which has simple cotton curtains in a blue check pattern. A stone mortar and pestle (molcajete) sits on the counter. Copper-bottomed pots hang from iron hooks on the wall. A wooden bread box, a ceramic sugar bowl, and a tin coffee canister sit on the counter. The window shows deep indigo sky turning gray.

### Scene 029: Feeding the Cats
**Time:** 5:47 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at floor level
**Description:** Carmen bends carefully — one hand on the counter for support — to place two small ceramic bowls on the terra-cotta tile floor near the kitchen doorway. She scoops dry cat food from a bag stored under the sink into each bowl. Canela the orange tabby is already eating before Carmen finishes pouring. Michi the gray-and-white cat pushes in beside Canela. A third bowl waits for Negrito, who has not yet appeared from the bedroom. A small water bowl — blue ceramic — sits beside the food bowls, already filled. Carmen's dark blue skirt brushes the floor as she bends. Her reading glasses slide down her nose. The two cats crunch their food audibly in the quiet pre-dawn kitchen.

### Scene 030: Filling the Kettle
**Time:** 5:50 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Carmen fills a copper-bottomed kettle with water from the kitchen sink faucet. The kettle is old, well-used, with a dark wooden handle. She carries it carefully to the gas stove and sets it on a burner, turning the knob — the gas clicks and ignites with a small blue flame ring. The stove's blue ceramic tile backsplash reflects the flame. On the counter beside the stove, the tin coffee canister, the ceramic sugar bowl with a small spoon, and a dark brown ceramic coffee mug wait. The kitchen window above the sink is beginning to show pale gray-blue dawn. Canela finishes eating and begins washing her face with her paw near the food bowls.

### Scene 031: Preparing Tinto
**Time:** 5:53 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen spoons dark ground Colombian coffee from the tin canister into a small cloth coffee strainer (colador de tela) — a traditional Colombian brewing method using a cloth filter on a wire frame set over the ceramic mug. The coffee grounds are dark and aromatic. She waits for the kettle to boil, one hand resting on the counter. The blue gas flame licks under the copper kettle. Steam begins to rise from the spout. The kitchen smells of coffee grounds. Michi the gray-and-white cat has jumped onto a chair at the kitchen table and sits watching Carmen with bright eyes. The overhead light casts warm shadows on the whitewashed walls.

### Scene 032: Pouring Hot Water
**Time:** 5:56 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Carmen carefully lifts the steaming copper kettle from the stove and pours hot water slowly through the cloth coffee strainer into the dark brown ceramic mug. The water darkens instantly as it filters through the ground coffee, dripping rich brown tinto into the mug below. Steam curls upward. Her weathered hands hold the kettle steadily despite their age. The cloth strainer, held by its wire frame, catches the coffee grounds. The kitchen fills with the deep, warm aroma of fresh Colombian coffee. Carmen adds two spoonfuls of sugar from the ceramic sugar bowl, stirring with a small spoon.

### Scene 033: First Sip of Coffee
**Time:** 5:58 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen sits at the dark wooden kitchen table by the window, both hands wrapped around the warm ceramic mug of tinto. She blows gently across the surface, then takes her first careful sip, closing her eyes in quiet satisfaction. Her reading glasses fog slightly from the steam. The blue check curtains on the window frame a sky that is transitioning from gray to pale gold on the eastern horizon. Canela the orange cat has jumped onto the second chair, curled into a ball. The tin coffee canister and sugar bowl remain on the counter. The gas stove flame is off now. Morning silence fills the kitchen, broken only by Canela's soft purring.

### Scene 034: Listening to Radio
**Time:** 6:00 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen reaches to a small portable radio on the kitchen windowsill and turns the dial. The radio crackles to life with a local Boyaca morning program — news and traditional music. The radio is old, cream-colored plastic with a silver dial and a short antenna. Carmen sips her tinto and listens, one hand on the warm mug, the other resting on the table. The announcer's voice fills the small kitchen. Through the window, the sky is brightening to pale gold and blue. The courtyard outside the kitchen window is still in shadow, the outlines of potted plants and the stone fountain barely visible. Michi has curled up on the chair across from Carmen.

### Scene 035: Opening Kitchen Shutters
**Time:** 6:05 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at window
**Description:** Carmen stands and unlatches the heavy wooden shutters on the kitchen window, pushing them open to let in the cool mountain morning air. Villa de Leyva sits at 2,144 meters elevation, and the dawn air is crisp and fresh, carrying the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth. The courtyard is revealed through the open window — stone floor, potted geraniums and ferns, the old stone fountain with its planter full of trailing vines, whitewashed walls with purple bougainvillea just beginning to catch the light. The cool breeze ruffles the blue check curtains. Carmen takes a deep breath of the fresh highland air. Her coffee mug sits on the table behind her, still steaming.

### Scene 036: Preparing Changua
**Time:** 6:08 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen sets a medium clay pot on the gas stove and turns on the burner. She pours milk from a glass bottle into the pot, then adds water, creating the base for changua — a traditional Boyaca breakfast soup of milk, water, scallions, and poached eggs. She pulls a bunch of fresh green scallions (cebolla larga) from the small refrigerator and places them on the wooden cutting board beside the stove. A small knife, a salt shaker, and a pepper mill sit nearby. The milk-and-water mixture begins to heat. The clay pot is reddish-brown, unglazed, a traditional Colombian cooking vessel. The radio continues playing softly on the windowsill.

### Scene 037: Chopping Scallions
**Time:** 6:10 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Carmen stands at the counter, chopping the long green scallions into small rings with a well-worn kitchen knife on a wooden cutting board. Her weathered hands grip the knife with practiced confidence. The green and white rings of scallion pile up on the board. Beside her, the clay pot on the stove begins to simmer, small bubbles forming in the milk mixture. The scallion's sharp fresh scent mixes with the lingering coffee aroma. A few stray rings of scallion roll across the cutting board. Carmen's embroidered blouse sleeves are pushed up slightly, revealing the age spots on her forearms. The overhead kitchen light catches the gold frames of her reading glasses.

### Scene 038: Adding Scallions to Pot
**Time:** 6:13 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen scoops the chopped scallions from the cutting board with the flat of the knife blade and slides them into the simmering clay pot. The scallions hit the hot milk mixture with a soft sizzle. She stirs gently with a wooden spoon, the liquid turning slightly green-tinged from the scallions. She adds a pinch of salt from the salt shaker and a few grinds of black pepper from the mill. The mixture simmers steadily, steam rising. The kitchen window shows the courtyard brightening as the sun clears the colonial rooftops. Canela sits on the floor near the stove, drawn by the cooking smells.

### Scene 039: Cracking Eggs
**Time:** 6:16 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen cracks two brown eggs, one at a time, into the simmering changua broth. She taps each egg firmly on the rim of the clay pot, then opens it with both thumbs, letting the egg slip gently into the milky broth to poach. The egg whites begin to set immediately in the hot liquid, turning opaque around the golden yolks. A brown eggshell sits on the counter in a small dish. Carmen watches the eggs carefully, wooden spoon ready. The changua is nearly ready — the scallions float green among the white poaching eggs. The traditional Boyaca breakfast soup fills the kitchen with its comforting, savory-milky aroma.

### Scene 040: Toasting Arepa Boyacense
**Time:** 6:18 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** On the second burner of the gas stove, Carmen places a flat iron griddle (budare). She takes two round, thick arepa boyacenses from a cloth-covered basket on the counter — these are wheat-and-corn arepas mixed with fresh cheese, a Boyaca specialty. She places them on the hot griddle, where they begin to sizzle gently. The arepas are pale golden, thick, and round, about the size of her palm. The cheese inside will melt as they toast. Carmen watches both the changua pot and the arepas simultaneously, wooden spoon in one hand. The kitchen is now warm from the two burners and filled with the combined aromas of changua and toasting corn-and-cheese.

### Scene 041: Setting the Table
**Time:** 6:22 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen sets a place at the dark wooden kitchen table: a ceramic bowl for the changua, a small ceramic plate for the arepa, a metal spoon, a cloth napkin in a simple blue pattern. She also sets out a small ceramic pot of honey and a glass of fresh water. The place setting is neat, simple, and practiced — one place, as she eats alone. Through the open window, the courtyard is now bathed in early morning light, the purple bougainvillea vivid against the whitewashed walls. The radio plays a cumbia song softly. Michi has moved from the chair to the windowsill, watching birds in the courtyard.

### Scene 042: Flipping the Arepas
**Time:** 6:24 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen uses a flat metal spatula to flip the arepa boyacenses on the iron griddle. The undersides are golden-brown and slightly crispy, with the cheese beginning to ooze at the edges. She flips them deftly — a movement she has made thousands of times in her life. The second side begins to toast with a satisfying sizzle. The changua in the clay pot beside them has the eggs perfectly poached, the whites firm around the soft yolks floating in the milky green-speckled broth. Carmen turns the gas down on both burners to low. The arepas need just another minute.

### Scene 043: Serving Changua
**Time:** 6:26 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen carries the clay pot to the table, setting it on a woven trivet. She ladles the changua into the ceramic bowl with a deep wooden ladle — the milky broth with green scallion pieces and one perfectly poached egg settling into the bowl. Steam rises from the bowl. She takes the second egg for later. The changua is traditional comfort food, warm and nourishing. She places the golden-brown arepa boyacense on the small plate beside the bowl. The cheese has melted into the corn-and-wheat dough, creating a soft stretchy center. Carmen sits down, adjusts her reading glasses, and unfolds the cloth napkin onto her lap.

### Scene 044: Eating Breakfast
**Time:** 6:28 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen eats her changua, spooning the warm milky broth and breaking the poached egg yolk so it runs golden into the soup. She tears a piece of arepa boyacense and dips it into the broth — the traditional way to eat changua in Boyaca. Her expression is content, the simple pleasure of a familiar breakfast. The radio plays softly. Through the open window, sunlight now streams into the courtyard, illuminating the potted geraniums in red and pink. Canela has jumped onto the windowsill beside Michi, both cats basking in the first warm rays. The honey pot on the table is for the second arepa, which she will eat sweet.

### Scene 045: Honey on Arepa
**Time:** 6:35 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen drizzles golden honey from the small ceramic honey pot onto her second arepa boyacense, using a wooden honey dipper. The honey flows in a thick amber stream, pooling on the golden surface of the warm arepa. This is the sweet version — after the savory changua. She lifts the arepa and takes a bite, the honey clinging to her lips, which she dabs with the cloth napkin. The changua bowl is now mostly empty, the broth almost gone. The morning light through the window has turned fully golden, warming the kitchen table surface. The tin coffee canister on the counter reminds her she wants a second tinto.

### Scene 046: Second Cup of Coffee
**Time:** 6:40 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Carmen stands at the counter, pouring a second mug of tinto. She reheated the kettle and is filtering hot water through the cloth strainer again with fresh coffee grounds. The dark liquid drips into her brown ceramic mug. She adds sugar, stirs. This is the rhythm of her mornings — unhurried, methodical. The breakfast dishes remain on the table. The radio news has shifted to weather: cool and clear today in Villa de Leyva, high of 18 degrees Celsius. Carmen carries her fresh mug to the table and sits again, sipping slowly, watching the courtyard through the window as the day begins in earnest.

### Scene 047: Washing Breakfast Dishes
**Time:** 6:48 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Carmen stands at the kitchen sink, washing the breakfast dishes by hand. The clay changua pot soaks in soapy water. She scrubs the ceramic bowl and plate with a dish brush, rinses them under the faucet, and places them in a small wooden drying rack beside the sink. The metal spoon and ladle go in too. Her sleeves are pushed up, soapy water running over her weathered hands with their age spots and prominent veins. The iron griddle is wiped clean with a cloth. Through the window above the sink, the courtyard is bright and inviting. Canela has gone outside and is sniffing around the potted herbs.

### Scene 048: Drying Hands
**Time:** 6:52 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Carmen dries her hands on a cotton dish towel that hangs from a hook beside the sink. The towel has a blue and white striped pattern, slightly faded from many washes. She checks the drying rack — everything draining properly. She wipes down the counter with a damp cloth, then the table surface. The kitchen is tidy again, as she left it last night. She hangs the dish towel back on its hook and drapes the damp cloth over the faucet to dry. The gas stove burners are off, the clay pot drying in the rack, the food put away. Order restored.

### Scene 049: Putting On Craft Apron
**Time:** 6:55 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, by doorway to courtyard
**Description:** Carmen takes her dark blue denim craft apron from a hook by the kitchen doorway that leads to the courtyard. She loops it over her head and ties the strings behind her waist with a practiced motion, the apron covering the front of her embroidered blouse and dark blue skirt. The apron has two large front pockets, slightly stained with clay dust and fiber lint from her craft work. She also picks up the burgundy wool cardigan from the back of the kitchen chair and pulls it on — the courtyard will be cool in the early morning mountain air. She adjusts her reading glasses and steps toward the courtyard door.

### Scene 050: Stepping Into the Courtyard
**Time:** 7:00 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, doorway from kitchen
**Description:** Carmen steps through the wooden doorway from the kitchen into the interior courtyard, and the cool mountain morning envelops her. The courtyard is beautiful in the early light: stone floor warmed by the sun on the eastern side, still in cool shadow on the western side. Potted geraniums in red and pink line the whitewashed walls. Ferns hang from iron hooks on the wooden columns that support the corredor roof with its clay tiles. The old stone fountain in the center, now a planter, overflows with trailing green vines and pink begonias. Purple and orange bougainvillea climbs the far wall in a riot of color. Canela the orange tabby is sprawled on a warm sunny patch of stone, eyes half-closed. The air smells of eucalyptus, damp earth, and the faintest hint of wood smoke from a neighbor's chimney. Carmen takes a deep, contented breath.

## PART 4: MORNING — ARTISAN WORKSHOP / COURTYARD (7:00 AM - 9:30 AM)

### Scene 051: Watering the Plants
**Time:** 7:02 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at potted plants
**Description:** Carmen picks up a green watering can from beside the kitchen doorway and begins watering her potted plants along the courtyard wall. She pours gently over the red geraniums, the pink begonias trailing from the stone fountain planter, the hanging ferns on the corredor columns. Water darkens the terra-cotta pots and trickles onto the stone floor. Her burgundy cardigan is buttoned against the cool morning air. The craft apron protects her blouse. She speaks softly to the plants — an old habit — as she waters each one. Michi the gray-and-white cat watches a water droplet slide down a fern frond, batting at it with a paw.

### Scene 052: Watering the Herbs
**Time:** 7:06 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at herb pots
**Description:** Carmen moves to the row of clay herb pots near the kitchen doorway — fresh cilantro with its feathery leaves, bushy oregano, fragrant mint, and a small rosemary bush. She waters each one carefully, then pinches a few mint leaves between her fingers, bringing them to her nose to smell the fresh sharp scent. The herbs are essential to her cooking. The morning sun has reached the herb pots, warming the soil. A small hand-written wooden marker in each pot identifies the herb in slightly shaky script. The watering can is nearly empty. Canela has rolled onto her back on the warm stones, orange belly exposed to the sun.

### Scene 053: Checking the Loom
**Time:** 7:10 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area under corredor
**Description:** Carmen walks to the covered workshop area under the corredor — a long covered porch supported by wooden columns with a clay tile roof. Her traditional backstrap loom (telar de cintura) is set up here, one end tied to a wooden column, the other end with a leather strap that wraps around the weaver's back. A half-finished textile stretches on the loom's warp threads — a runner in red, orange, and cream stripes with a geometric diamond pattern in the center, traditional Boyaca design. Carmen runs her weathered hand along the taut warp threads, checking the tension. Baskets of colored wool yarn sit on a low wooden shelf beside the loom — skeins in red, orange, cream, dark blue, green, and brown.

### Scene 054: Sitting at the Loom
**Time:** 7:14 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen settles onto a low wooden stool positioned at the loom. She hooks the leather backstrap around her lower back and leans backward slightly, creating tension on the warp threads. The half-finished textile — about two-thirds complete — displays the red, orange, and cream pattern crisply. The weft thread, currently cream-colored, is threaded through a wooden shuttle (lanzadera). Carmen's reading glasses are positioned on the tip of her nose so she can see both the close weaving and the overall pattern. Her craft apron pockets hold small wooden tools. The morning light under the corredor is even and good for detailed work.

### Scene 055: Weaving — Lifting the Heddle
**Time:** 7:18 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom close-up
**Description:** Carmen lifts the wooden heddle bar, which separates the warp threads into two layers, creating a gap (shed) between them. Her weathered fingers grip the smooth wooden bar firmly. The warp threads — cream-colored cotton — separate cleanly into upper and lower layers. The shed opens like a narrow mouth across the width of the textile. The previously woven section below shows tight, even rows of the geometric pattern. Carmen's hands are strong despite her age — decades of weaving have kept them nimble. The backstrap presses against her lower back as she controls the tension with her body.

### Scene 056: Passing the Shuttle
**Time:** 7:20 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom close-up
**Description:** Carmen passes the wooden shuttle — carrying the cream-colored weft thread — through the open shed from left to right. The shuttle is a flat, smooth piece of dark wood, tapered at both ends, with the wool thread wrapped around its middle. Her right hand catches it as it emerges from the other side of the warp. The cream thread now stretches across the width of the textile. Carmen's movements are fluid and practiced — this is muscle memory perfected over fifty years. The partially completed diamond pattern in red and orange stands out against the cream background. Michi the gray-and-white cat has settled near Carmen's feet, watching the shuttle pass back and forth.

### Scene 057: Beating the Weft
**Time:** 7:22 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom close-up
**Description:** Carmen uses a flat wooden beater (machete de tejer) to press the newly placed weft thread firmly against the previously woven rows. She pushes the beater forward with both hands in a decisive, rhythmic motion — thump, thump — packing the thread tightly. The weave grows denser and more uniform. The sound of the beater is rhythmic and satisfying, echoing softly under the corredor roof. The cream thread is now snugly integrated into the pattern. Carmen checks the edge of the textile — even and straight, the mark of an experienced weaver. She leans back slightly to adjust tension, the backstrap creaking faintly.

### Scene 058: Changing Yarn Color
**Time:** 7:30 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen reaches into the basket of colored wool yarn on the shelf beside her and selects a skein of deep red wool. She cuts the cream weft thread with small sharp scissors from her apron pocket and ties on the red thread with a tiny, nearly invisible knot. The transition point will be hidden in the pattern. The skeins in the basket are vibrant — natural dyes and commercial dyes mixed: red from cochineal, orange from achiote, cream from undyed wool, dark blue from indigo. Carmen wraps the red thread onto the shuttle, preparing to continue the diamond pattern. Her reading glasses catch the morning light.

### Scene 059: Weaving the Diamond Pattern
**Time:** 7:35 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen weaves with focused concentration, passing the red shuttle back and forth through carefully selected warp threads to create the diamond motif. Each row requires counting threads — the pattern is in her head, memorized from her mother who taught her as a girl. Her lips move slightly as she counts. The red diamond shape is growing, symmetrical and precise, against the cream background. This textile will be a table runner, sold at the Saturday market or given to a grandchild. The corredor provides pleasant shade as the courtyard sun grows stronger. Canela has moved from the sunny stone to the shade near Carmen's stool, stretched long and languid.

### Scene 060: Pausing to Rest Hands
**Time:** 7:50 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen pauses her weaving, flexing her hands open and closed several times to relieve the stiffness in her arthritic fingers. She rubs her knuckles gently, massaging the joints. The leather backstrap is loosened as she leans forward, releasing the tension on the loom. The half-finished textile hangs between the column and her stool, the new rows of red diamond pattern clearly visible. Carmen reaches for a glass of water on the small table nearby and takes a long sip. The morning sun has moved across the courtyard, warming the stone floor in golden patches. A hummingbird hovers at the bougainvillea on the far wall, its wings a blur of iridescent green.

### Scene 061: Rocking Chair Break
**Time:** 7:55 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, rocking chair
**Description:** Carmen moves from the loom stool to the wooden rocking chair in the workshop area, settling into its curved seat with a soft sigh. The chair is dark wood, polished smooth from years of use, with a woven rush seat. She rocks gently, back and forth, the chair creaking rhythmically on the stone floor. Negrito the black cat has finally emerged from the bedroom and found his way to the courtyard, settling under the rocking chair in his favorite spot. Carmen rests her hands in her apron-covered lap, looking out at the sunlit courtyard. The potted plants glow in the morning light. The fountain planter overflows with green. The air is warming gradually but still pleasant.

### Scene 062: Inspecting Pottery Shelves
**Time:** 8:05 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery shelves
**Description:** Carmen rises from the rocking chair and walks to the wooden shelves along the corredor wall where her finished pottery pieces are displayed. The shelves hold an array of handmade ceramics: terra-cotta bowls with painted blue and white designs, small vases with floral patterns, drinking cups, a set of plate-like serving dishes, and a few decorative figurines of birds and cats. Carmen picks up a small vase, turning it in her hands, checking the glaze for imperfections. The pottery is her second craft — she learned from a neighbor artisan decades ago. Each piece is signed with a small "C" on the bottom. The shelves also hold bags of clay, glazes in jars, and painting brushes in a tin can.

### Scene 063: Setting Up Pottery Wheel
**Time:** 8:10 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery table
**Description:** Carmen approaches the sturdy wooden table where her small pottery wheel sits. It is a kick wheel — she presses a foot pedal to spin the wheel head. She removes the cloth cover from the wheel, revealing the smooth plaster surface. A block of gray clay sits in a sealed plastic bag on the table. She opens the bag and cuts a portion of clay with a wire tool, the clay dense and cool in her hands. A bucket of water sits under the table. A set of pottery tools — wooden ribs, wire cutters, a sponge, a needle tool, a small metal scraper — are arranged in a ceramic cup on the table. Carmen places the clay chunk on the wheel head and presses it down firmly.

### Scene 064: Wetting the Clay
**Time:** 8:14 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery table close-up
**Description:** Carmen dips her hands into the bucket of water under the table, wetting them thoroughly. She begins to press and shape the clay on the wheel head, wetting it further with splashes from her cupped hands. The clay darkens from gray to dark brown as it absorbs water. Her weathered hands work the clay firmly — this is the wedging process, pushing air bubbles out of the clay. Her craft apron catches stray water and clay spatters. The reading glasses sit on the tip of her nose. Her gold cross necklace swings slightly as she leans forward, pressing the clay with the heels of her palms.

### Scene 065: Centering the Clay
**Time:** 8:18 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery wheel close-up
**Description:** Carmen kicks the foot pedal, and the pottery wheel begins to spin. She presses both wet hands around the clay as it rotates, pushing it inward and upward, centering the mass on the wheel. The clay wobbles at first, then gradually becomes smooth and centered under her steady pressure. Water and slip — thin liquid clay — coat her hands and the wheel surface. The spinning motion is hypnotic. Carmen's eyes are focused intently through her reading glasses. Her strong hands, despite the wrinkles and age spots, command the clay with authority. Michi the gray-and-white cat sits on the nearby shelf, mesmerized by the spinning wheel.

### Scene 066: Opening the Clay
**Time:** 8:22 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery wheel close-up
**Description:** With the clay centered and spinning, Carmen pushes both thumbs into the top of the clay mass, opening a well in the center. She presses downward carefully, creating the hollow interior of what will become a small bowl. The walls of the clay rise around her thumbs. Water and slip make the clay slippery and responsive. She keeps the wheel spinning at a steady pace with her foot. The opening widens as she draws her thumbs apart, shaping the floor of the bowl. Gray clay slip covers her hands up to the wrists. The pottery tools in the ceramic cup wait nearby for the next stages.

### Scene 067: Pulling Up the Walls
**Time:** 8:26 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery wheel close-up
**Description:** Carmen places one hand inside the bowl form and one outside, and slowly pulls the walls upward as the wheel spins. The clay rises between her fingers, the walls growing thinner and taller. This is the most delicate part — too much pressure and the wall collapses, too little and it stays thick. Her hands move upward in a smooth, steady motion. Water runs in thin rivulets down the clay surface. The bowl is taking shape — a simple, elegant form with slightly flared sides. The foot pedal maintains a consistent spin. Carmen's breath is steady, her concentration total. The courtyard sounds — birdsong, cat footsteps, distant church bells — are distant backdrop.

### Scene 068: Shaping the Rim
**Time:** 8:32 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery wheel close-up
**Description:** Carmen uses a damp sponge pressed against the rim of the spinning bowl to smooth and even the top edge. The sponge removes excess clay and water, leaving a clean, rounded rim. She then takes a wooden rib tool from the ceramic cup and holds it gently against the outside wall, refining the curve. The bowl is now clearly formed — about six inches across, with graceful flared sides and a smooth rim. Clay slip coats the wheel surface around the base. Carmen slows the wheel by reducing her foot pressure, then stops it to inspect the bowl from several angles. She nods, satisfied with the proportions.

### Scene 069: Cutting the Bowl from the Wheel
**Time:** 8:38 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery table
**Description:** Carmen takes the wire cutting tool — a thin wire strung between two wooden handles — and slides it under the base of the bowl, between the clay and the wheel surface. The wire slices cleanly through, separating the bowl from the wheel head. She lifts the bowl carefully with both hands, fingers spread wide, and transfers it to a wooden drying board on the table beside the wheel. The bowl sits on the board, glistening wet and gray, slightly darker where the clay is thickest. Two other pieces from previous days — a small vase and a cup — sit further along the board, drier and lighter in color, waiting to be fired. Carmen wipes her hands on a damp cloth.

### Scene 070: Starting a Second Piece
**Time:** 8:42 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery wheel
**Description:** Carmen cuts another portion of clay from the block and begins the process again — wedging, wetting, centering. This piece will be a small cup. She works with confident efficiency, her hands knowing each step. The wheel spins, the clay responds. The morning sun has moved further across the courtyard, the shadow line from the corredor roof retreating. Canela has moved to the pottery table shelf to sun herself beside the finished pieces. Negrito sleeps deeply under the rocking chair, oblivious. The small radio in the kitchen can still be heard faintly through the open doorway — a vallenato song playing.

### Scene 071: Shaping the Cup
**Time:** 8:50 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery wheel close-up
**Description:** Carmen shapes the clay into a small drinking cup on the spinning wheel, pulling the walls higher and keeping them straighter than the bowl. Her wet hands guide the clay upward in a cylindrical form. She uses her pinky finger to create a slight indentation near the top — a decorative ring. The cup is about four inches tall. She smooths the rim with the damp sponge, then uses the wooden rib on the exterior wall. The cup has a simple, clean elegance. Clay slip covers the wheel and Carmen's forearms. Her craft apron is spotted with gray clay. She slows the wheel and examines the cup critically through her reading glasses.

### Scene 072: Cutting the Cup Free
**Time:** 8:55 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery table
**Description:** Carmen slides the wire tool under the cup base and lifts it to the wooden drying board, placing it beside the bowl she made earlier. Two freshly thrown pieces sit side by side — the flared bowl and the straight cup — both wet and glistening gray. She will add handles and decorative details later, when the clay is leather-hard. Carmen covers the fresh pieces loosely with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying too quickly. She wipes the wheel clean with a sponge, scraping off excess clay and slip. The pottery tools go back in the ceramic cup. The bucket of water is murky with dissolved clay.

### Scene 073: Washing Hands at Courtyard Spigot
**Time:** 9:00 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at wall spigot
**Description:** Carmen walks to a simple brass spigot mounted on the courtyard wall near the kitchen doorway. She turns it on and washes the clay from her hands and forearms under the cold water stream. Gray clay swirls off her skin, running across the stone floor into a small drain. She uses a stiff brush to clean under her fingernails, scrubbing methodically. The water is cold from the mountain pipes and makes her hands ache slightly, but she scrubs thoroughly. Her craft apron catches the splashing water. The wet stone floor gleams in the sunlight. Michi trots over to investigate the running water, pawing at the stream.

### Scene 074: Drying Hands on Apron
**Time:** 9:03 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, near kitchen doorway
**Description:** Carmen turns off the spigot and dries her hands on a small rough towel that hangs from a hook beside the spigot. Her hands are clean now — the deep lines and wrinkles visible, the age spots dark against her light olive skin. Her fingernails are short and practical, trimmed for craft work. She flexes her fingers again, the arthritis a dull ache in the cool air. The craft apron is damp and clay-spotted. She unties it and hangs it on the hook beside the towel — she will wear it again after the morning break. Her white embroidered blouse and dark blue skirt are clean beneath. The burgundy cardigan is warm and comfortable.

### Scene 075: Mid-Morning Coffee Break
**Time:** 9:08 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at small table
**Description:** Carmen carries a fresh mug of tinto and a small plate with a piece of pan de sagua — a traditional Boyaca cheese bread — from the kitchen to the small wooden table in the courtyard. She sits in one of the two wooden chairs, the mug steaming in the cool air. The pan de sagua is golden and crusty, with melted cheese visible in the bread's interior. The courtyard is now fully lit, the sun warm on the stone floor, the potted plants vibrant with color. Purple bougainvillea cascades down the far wall. Canela jumps onto Carmen's lap as she sits, and Carmen strokes the orange cat absently while sipping her coffee.

### Scene 076: Enjoying the Courtyard
**Time:** 9:15 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at small table
**Description:** Carmen sits at the small courtyard table, both hands around her coffee mug, watching the life of her small courtyard. A hummingbird visits the bougainvillea flowers, darting from bloom to bloom. Canela purrs on her lap. Michi stalks a butterfly near the fountain planter, crouching low and wiggling before pouncing — and missing. Negrito has emerged from under the rocking chair and sits on the warm stones, washing his face with his paw. The distant sound of church bells rings from the Villa de Leyva parish church — marking the hour. Carmen closes her eyes and listens. The pan de sagua is half-eaten on the plate. The morning is peaceful and golden.

### Scene 077: Returning to the Loom
**Time:** 9:25 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen ties the craft apron back on, settles onto the low wooden stool at the loom, and hooks the leather backstrap around her waist again. She resumes weaving where she left off — the red diamond pattern is nearly complete, and she needs to transition back to cream for the next stripe section. She picks up the shuttle with the red thread and begins the rhythmic sequence: lift heddle, pass shuttle, beat with the wooden beater, change shed, pass shuttle back. The rhythm is meditative, the click and thump of the loom a heartbeat of the workshop. The morning is warming, and she has pushed the cardigan sleeves up her forearms.

### Scene 078: Weaving in Rhythm
**Time:** 9:35 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen weaves steadily, her body rocking slightly with each pass of the shuttle — lean back to tension, lean forward to beat. The textile grows row by row, the red diamond now complete, the cream border emerging around it. The backstrap loom is ancient technology, unchanged for centuries in the Boyaca highlands. Carmen learned from her mother, who learned from hers. The shuttle passes — swish — the beater presses — thump. Canela has curled up on the warm stone beside the stool. The corredor shade is pleasant. The half-finished textile displays hours of patient work — tight, even, beautiful.

### Scene 079: A Neighbor Visits
**Time:** 9:45 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, workshop area
**Description:** A voice calls from the front of the house — "Dona Carmen! Buenos dias!" A neighbor woman, Dona Esperanza, appears at the courtyard entrance carrying a small basket covered with a cloth. She is a stout woman in her sixties with dark hair streaked with gray, wearing a long skirt and wool shawl similar to Carmen's. Carmen unhooks the backstrap and stands to greet her, the two women exchanging cheek kisses. Dona Esperanza has brought fresh almojabanas — small cheese rolls — still warm. She admires the weaving on the loom, touching the diamond pattern with appreciation. The cats scatter at the visitor's arrival.

### Scene 080: Tea with a Neighbor
**Time:** 9:50 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at small table
**Description:** Carmen and Dona Esperanza sit at the small courtyard table. Carmen has brought two cups of aguapanela — a traditional hot drink made from dissolved panela (raw cane sugar block) with a squeeze of lime — from the kitchen. The warm almojabanas from Esperanza's basket sit on a plate between them. The two women talk and laugh, gesturing with their hands. Esperanza examines one of Carmen's pottery pieces from the shelf, holding up a small painted vase with admiration. The courtyard is a warm, convivial space. Canela has returned and sits by Carmen's chair. The bougainvillea rustles in a light breeze. The conversation flows in the easy way of old friends who have known each other for decades.

### Scene 081: Neighbor Departs
**Time:** 10:10 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, near entrance
**Description:** Carmen walks Dona Esperanza to the courtyard entrance — a heavy wooden door that leads to the street through a short zaguan (entrance hallway). They exchange cheek kisses again and parting words. Esperanza's basket is now empty of almojabanas but holds a small pottery cup that Carmen insisted she take as a gift. Carmen waves from the doorway as Esperanza walks up the cobblestone street. The street outside is quiet — Villa de Leyva's colonial facades of whitewashed walls and dark green wooden doors and window frames stretch along the cobblestones. A few people walk in the distance. Carmen closes the heavy wooden door and returns to the courtyard.

---

## PART 5: LATE MORNING — KITCHEN AND COURTYARD (10:10 AM - 12:30 PM)

### Scene 082: Clearing the Table
**Time:** 10:12 AM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at small table
**Description:** Carmen clears the courtyard table, carrying the two cups and the plate with almojabana crumbs back to the kitchen. She walks carefully on the stone floor, balancing the items. In the kitchen, she sets them in the sink. The radio is still playing softly. She fills a glass of water for herself from a ceramic jug (filtro) on the counter — the water is cool and filtered. She drinks slowly, then refills the cats' water bowl on the floor. Michi appears immediately, lapping at the fresh water with a delicate pink tongue. Carmen watches the cat drink, smiling.

### Scene 083: Returning to Loom Work
**Time:** 10:20 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen settles back at the loom for another weaving session. She has changed the weft thread to dark blue, beginning a new stripe section after the cream. The dark blue thread contrasts beautifully with the cream warp and the completed red diamond. She weaves with quiet focus, the shuttle passing back and forth, the beater pressing each row tight. The textile is more than three-quarters complete now — the end is in sight. The courtyard sun has climbed higher, casting the corredor into deeper shade. Carmen works in comfortable shadow, the light even and flattering on the vibrant yarn colors.

### Scene 084: Finishing the Textile
**Time:** 10:45 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom close-up
**Description:** Carmen weaves the final rows of the textile runner — cream weft threads creating a clean border to match the beginning. She passes the shuttle through the last row, beats it firmly with the wooden beater, then sits back, admiring the completed work. The textile runner is about two feet long and ten inches wide, displaying a symmetrical pattern: cream borders, a central band of red and orange diamonds on cream, flanked by dark blue stripes. The colors are vivid and the weaving tight and even. Carmen cuts the weft thread with her small scissors and ties it off neatly. She exhales with satisfaction — this piece took three days.

### Scene 085: Removing Textile from Loom
**Time:** 10:50 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen carefully unties the completed textile from the loom, first unhooking the backstrap from her waist, then untying the far end from the wooden column. She slides the textile off the warp sticks, the fabric relaxing and softening as the tension releases. The completed runner drapes over her hands — soft, warm wool with tight weaving. She holds it up to the light, examining both sides for any imperfections. The pattern is consistent front to back. She folds it loosely and carries it to the shelves, laying it atop a stack of other finished textiles — smaller woven pieces in various patterns and colors, all destined for the Saturday market.

### Scene 086: Setting Up New Warp
**Time:** 10:55 AM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen begins the process of setting up a new warp on the loom — this will be the foundation for her next weaving project. She selects cream and light brown wool yarn from the baskets and begins winding the yarn between two wooden pegs clamped to the table, creating the long parallel threads that form the warp. Her hands move in a figure-eight pattern, crossing the threads to create the counting cross. This process is methodical and meditative. The new yarn is cream-colored with a slight golden tint. Canela bats at a dangling thread end, and Carmen gently pushes the cat away.

### Scene 087: Lunch Preparation Begins
**Time:** 11:15 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Carmen removes the craft apron, hangs it on its hook, and enters the kitchen to begin lunch preparation. She opens the small refrigerator and surveys the contents: fresh vegetables, a container of beans, eggs, cheese, a piece of chicken. Today she will make a simple cocido boyacense — a traditional Boyaca stew. She pulls out potatoes (papa criolla — small yellow Colombian potatoes), carrots, a piece of pumpkin (ahuyama), green peas, and the chicken piece. She sets these on the counter beside the wooden cutting board. The kitchen fills with the earthy smell of raw vegetables. She turns on the radio louder — a news bulletin.

### Scene 088: Peeling Potatoes
**Time:** 11:20 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Carmen stands at the counter, peeling small yellow papa criolla potatoes with a paring knife. The thin golden skin curls off in strips, revealing the bright yellow flesh beneath. A bowl collects the potato peelings. The peeled potatoes go into a bowl of water to prevent browning. Her weathered hands handle the small knife with ease. Beside the potatoes, the carrots, pumpkin, and peas wait on the cutting board. The chicken piece sits on a separate plate. The afternoon sun through the kitchen window lights the yellow potatoes brightly. Canela sits on the kitchen floor near Carmen's feet, hoping for a dropped morsel.

### Scene 089: Cutting Vegetables
**Time:** 11:28 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Carmen chops the peeled carrots into thick rounds on the wooden cutting board, the knife making firm decisive cuts. The pumpkin is cut into large cubes — its orange flesh bright against the dark wood of the cutting board. The green peas are already shelled, sitting in a small bowl. She works through the vegetables methodically, each one joining a growing collection of prepared ingredients on the counter. The kitchen is organized and efficient despite its modest size. The copper-bottomed pots hang on the wall, ready. Carmen selects a large clay pot — her preferred cooking vessel — and sets it on the stove.

### Scene 090: Browning the Chicken
**Time:** 11:35 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen turns on the gas burner and adds a splash of oil to the large clay pot. When the oil shimmers, she places the chicken piece in — it sizzles loudly, the skin beginning to brown. She seasons it with salt, cumin, and a pinch of ground achiote (annatto) for color. The kitchen fills with the rich aroma of browning chicken. She turns the piece with a wooden spoon, browning all sides. The gas flame licks blue under the clay pot. Steam and savory smoke rise. Michi jumps onto the kitchen counter, drawn by the chicken smell, and Carmen shoos him down with a gentle "Fuera, Michi."

### Scene 091: Building the Stew
**Time:** 11:42 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen adds the chopped vegetables to the pot with the browned chicken: first the potatoes and carrots, then the pumpkin cubes, then water to cover. She adds a peeled whole garlic clove, a sprig of fresh cilantro from the courtyard herb pots, and a bay leaf from a small jar on the shelf. The stew begins to bubble gently as it comes to a simmer. She adjusts the gas to low, places a clay lid on the pot at a slight angle to let steam escape, and stirs once with the wooden spoon. The kitchen windows are steamy now. The stew will simmer for an hour. Carmen wipes her hands on the dish towel and turns to clean the cutting board.

### Scene 092: Cleaning Up
**Time:** 11:50 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Carmen washes the cutting board, the paring knife, and the vegetable bowls in the sink. Potato peelings go into a small compost bucket under the sink that she empties into a garden compost bin. She wipes down the counter with a damp cloth. The stew bubbles gently on the stove, its lid rattling softly. The kitchen smells richly of chicken, vegetables, and spices. Carmen hangs the dish towel on its hook and surveys the tidy kitchen with satisfaction. The radio plays a bambuco — traditional Colombian Andean music — and Carmen hums along softly, swaying slightly as she dries her hands.

### Scene 093: Stirring the Stew
**Time:** 12:00 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen lifts the clay lid and stirs the cocido boyacense with the wooden spoon. The stew has been simmering for twenty minutes — the chicken is pulling from the bone, the potatoes are softening, the carrot rounds and pumpkin cubes are tender but holding their shape. The broth has turned golden from the achiote and chicken. She adds the green peas now — they only need ten minutes. She tastes the broth from the spoon, adds a touch more salt, nods. The steam fogs her reading glasses. She wipes them on her blouse hem, replaces the lid, and leaves the stew to finish. The kitchen clock on the wall — an old wooden pendulum clock — reads noon.

### Scene 094: Making Aguapanela
**Time:** 12:05 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen fills a small pot with water and sets it on the second burner. She breaks off a chunk of panela — a solid block of raw cane sugar, dark amber in color, sold at the market — and drops it into the water. As the water heats, the panela dissolves, turning the water a warm caramel color. Aguapanela is the universal Colombian drink — hot or cold, with or without lime, served at every meal. Carmen will serve it warm with lunch. She cuts a lime in half on the cutting board — the bright green fruit releasing its sharp citrus scent — and squeezes one half into the dissolving panela water. The liquid turns slightly cloudy from the lime juice.

### Scene 095: Setting the Table for Lunch
**Time:** 12:15 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen sets a single place at the kitchen table for her solitary lunch: a ceramic bowl for the stew, a ceramic plate for rice (she has a small pot of white rice cooking on a back burner), a metal spoon, a cloth napkin, and a ceramic cup for the aguapanela. She also sets out the salt shaker and a small bowl of aji — a Colombian hot sauce made with cilantro, scallions, and chili. The table is set simply but properly — Dona Carmen maintains the standards of her generation. Through the open window, the courtyard is warm with midday sun. The lunchtime church bells toll in the distance — twelve long, resonant notes from the Villa de Leyva basilica.

### Scene 096: Serving the Rice
**Time:** 12:20 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen lifts the lid from the small pot on the back burner — perfectly fluffy white rice, each grain separate. She scoops rice onto the ceramic plate with a wooden paddle, shaping a neat mound. Steam rises from the white grains. The rice pot is a small aluminum vessel with a tight-fitting lid, the kind used across Colombia for rice-making. Carmen sets the plate on the table at her place. The stew is ready too — the peas have cooked, the chicken is falling off the bone, the vegetables are tender. The broth is golden and fragrant with cilantro and cumin.

### Scene 097: Serving the Cocido Boyacense
**Time:** 12:22 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen ladles the cocido boyacense into the ceramic bowl with the deep wooden ladle. Chunks of tender chicken, golden papa criolla potatoes, orange pumpkin cubes, round carrot slices, and bright green peas fill the bowl in a rich golden broth. A sprig of cilantro floats on top. The steam rises thickly. She carries the bowl to the table and sets it beside the rice plate. She pours warm aguapanela from the pot into her ceramic cup, the caramel-colored liquid fragrant with dissolved lime. Everything is ready. Carmen sits down, crosses herself briefly, murmurs a short grace, and unfolds the cloth napkin onto her lap.

### Scene 098: Eating Lunch
**Time:** 12:25 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen eats her cocido boyacense with rice, spooning the rich broth and tender vegetables into her mouth. She places pieces of rice on the spoon with chunks of stew — a spoonful of chicken with potato and broth over rice. She eats slowly, savoring each bite, as elderly people do. The meal is hearty and warming. She adds a small spoonful of aji hot sauce to the broth, stirring it in — the sauce gives a bright, spicy kick. The radio plays softly. Through the window, the courtyard is flooded with midday sun. All three cats are visible: Canela on the courtyard stones, Michi on the fountain planter edge, Negrito under the rocking chair in the shade.

### Scene 099: Finishing Lunch
**Time:** 12:40 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen finishes the last of her stew, wiping the bowl clean with a spoon. The rice plate is clean. She takes a long sip of warm aguapanela, the sweet drink complementing the savory meal. She dabs her mouth with the cloth napkin and sighs contentedly — a good, filling midday meal. She remains seated for a moment, hands resting on the table, listening to the radio and the courtyard sounds. A rooster crows somewhere in the distance — a common sound even in the town center of Villa de Leyva. The wooden pendulum clock on the wall ticks steadily, its brass pendulum swinging.

### Scene 100: Washing Lunch Dishes
**Time:** 12:45 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Carmen carries the lunch dishes to the sink and washes them by hand — the ceramic bowl, the plate, the cup, the spoon, the ladle, the cooking pots. She stores the leftover stew in a covered container in the refrigerator and the leftover rice in a small pot with a lid. The cutting board is wiped down again. She drains the sink, wrings out the dishcloth, and drapes it over the faucet. The kitchen is clean and orderly once more. She turns the radio off — the afternoon will be quieter. She dries her hands on the dish towel and looks toward the courtyard. It is time for her afternoon rest.

## PART 6: AFTERNOON — SIESTA AND REST (12:50 PM - 2:30 PM)

### Scene 101: Walking to the Bedroom
**Time:** 12:50 PM
**Setting:** Hallway to bedroom
**Description:** Carmen walks slowly down the hallway from the kitchen to her bedroom for her afternoon siesta. The house is quiet — the radio is off, the stove is cold, the dishes are done. Her leather slippers shuffle softly on the terra-cotta tiles. She passes the framed painting of the Virgin of Chiquinquira, crossing herself briefly. Negrito the black cat follows her down the hallway, anticipating the warm bed. Through the hallway window, the midday sun blazes on the cobblestone street outside. The thick adobe walls keep the house cool. Carmen's hand trails along the wall, steady and unhurried.

### Scene 102: Preparing for Siesta
**Time:** 12:53 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen enters her bedroom, which is cool and dim — the wooden shutters are half-closed against the midday heat, filtering the light into soft stripes across the terra-cotta floor. She removes her reading glasses and places them on the nightstand beside the framed photo of Don Eduardo. She takes off her low black shoes and sets them beside the bed. She unbuttons the burgundy wool cardigan and drapes it over the back of a wooden chair. She does not change clothes for siesta — she will rest in her blouse and skirt, pulling only a light cotton throw blanket over her legs. Negrito jumps onto the bed and circles three times before settling at the foot.

### Scene 103: Lying Down for Siesta
**Time:** 12:56 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen lies down on the large carved wooden bed, her silver-white hair against the fat feather pillow. She pulls the light cotton throw blanket over her legs and lower body. Her embroidered blouse is visible above the blanket. Without her reading glasses, her face looks softer, the deep wrinkles relaxed. Her gold cross necklace catches the dim light. She clasps her hands on her stomach, eyes closing. Negrito is a warm black weight at her feet. The room is quiet except for the distant sound of birds in the courtyard and the slow tick of a clock somewhere in the house. The striped light from the shutters lies across the wool rug on the floor.

### Scene 104: Sleeping During Siesta
**Time:** 1:15 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, wide view
**Description:** Carmen sleeps peacefully in the dim colonial bedroom. Her silver-white hair is slightly loosened on the pillow. Her breathing is slow and even. The light cotton blanket rises and falls gently. Negrito has shifted, stretching out along her calves, also asleep. The room is a study in stillness — the heavy dark wardrobe, the nightstand with its photograph and Virgin Mary statue, the crucifix on the wall, the thick whitewashed walls. Filtered afternoon light creates warm stripes on the floor. The lace curtains do not move — the air is still and warm. A distant church bell marks the half-hour with a single chime.

### Scene 105: Waking from Siesta
**Time:** 2:00 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen's eyes open slowly. She lies still for a moment, orienting herself, then sits up carefully, swinging her legs to the floor. The wool rug is warm under her stockinged feet. She reaches for her reading glasses on the nightstand and puts them on, the familiar gold frames settling on her nose. She rubs her eyes gently, then smooths her silver-white hair, checking that the bun is still intact — mostly, with a few wisps. She stands, stretches her back with a small grimace — the stiffness of age — and reaches for the burgundy cardigan on the chair. Negrito yawns enormously, showing pink gums, but does not move from the bed.

### Scene 106: Freshening Up After Siesta
**Time:** 2:05 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen splashes cold water on her face at the bathroom sink, refreshing herself after the siesta. The cold mountain water is bracing and wakes her fully. She pats her face dry with the floral hand towel, checks her hair in the mirror — tucking a few loose strands back into the bun — and straightens her embroidered blouse. Her reflection looks rested. She takes the comb from the shelf and smooths the hair at her temples. The bathroom is cool and quiet, the blue-and-white azulejo tiles familiar and comforting. She makes sure the gold cross necklace is centered at her collar. Ready for the afternoon.

## PART 7: AFTERNOON — GRANDCHILDREN VISIT (2:15 PM - 5:30 PM)

### Scene 107: A Car Arrives
**Time:** 2:15 PM
**Setting:** Front entrance, zaguan hallway
**Description:** The sound of a car door closing reaches Carmen in the kitchen, where she is heating water for aguapanela. Then voices — children's voices — high and excited, calling "Abuelita! Abuelita!" Carmen's face lights up with a wide, wrinkled smile. She hurries (as much as a 75-year-old hurries) down the short zaguan hallway toward the heavy wooden front door, wiping her hands on her skirt. Through the wooden door, knocking and giggling are audible. Carmen lifts the heavy iron latch and pulls the door open. Bright afternoon sunlight floods the dim entrance hallway.

### Scene 108: Greeting the Grandchildren
**Time:** 2:16 PM
**Setting:** Front entrance, doorway
**Description:** Three children rush through the doorway: Sofia (12, tall for her age, dark hair in a ponytail, wearing jeans and a pink sweater), Mateo (9, energetic, dark curly hair, wearing a football jersey and shorts), and Camila (7, shy, long dark hair with a headband, wearing a flower-print dress). They throw their arms around Carmen, who bends to embrace them, laughing. Behind them stands Lucia, Carmen's 46-year-old daughter — dark hair, warm brown eyes like her mother, carrying a canvas bag with supplies. "Hola, Mama," Lucia says, kissing Carmen's cheek. The cobblestone street behind them shows the parked car and the colonial facades of Villa de Leyva.

### Scene 109: Lucia Embracing Carmen
**Time:** 2:18 PM
**Setting:** Front entrance, zaguan
**Description:** Lucia embraces her mother in the cool zaguan hallway, holding her gently — aware of Carmen's small, fragile frame. Carmen pats her daughter's back. "You look well, Mama," Lucia says. Carmen cups Lucia's face in her weathered hands, examining her daughter with a mother's scrutiny. The grandchildren have already run ahead into the courtyard, their excited voices echoing off the whitewashed walls. Mateo shouts, "Where are the cats?" Camila follows more quietly, clutching a small backpack. Sofia walks with teenage composure, but she is smiling. Lucia hands Carmen the canvas bag — it contains fresh bread from a bakery in Tunja and a bag of groceries.

### Scene 110: Grandchildren in the Courtyard
**Time:** 2:22 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, wide view
**Description:** The courtyard comes alive with the grandchildren's energy. Mateo has found Canela the orange tabby and is crouching on the stone floor, petting her vigorously — Canela purrs loudly, rolling onto her back. Camila sits on the edge of the stone fountain planter, swinging her legs, watching the trailing vines. Sofia has gone straight to the workshop area and is examining the finished textile runner on the shelf. Carmen and Lucia emerge from the kitchen doorway into the courtyard. The space is transformed by the children's presence — voices, laughter, movement. Michi watches cautiously from the corredor roof, not yet sure about the small humans.

### Scene 111: Serving Aguapanela and Snacks
**Time:** 2:28 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at small table
**Description:** Carmen and Lucia carry trays from the kitchen to the courtyard table. Carmen has prepared warm aguapanela in ceramic cups for everyone, and a plate of buñuelos — small fried cheese balls, golden and crispy, a Colombian snack staple. She also sets out the fresh bread Lucia brought from Tunja, sliced and arranged on a plate. The small courtyard table now has extra chairs brought from inside. The three children gather around, Mateo grabbing a buñuelo immediately. Camila sips her aguapanela with both hands around the cup. Sofia thanks Carmen politely. Lucia sits beside her mother. The courtyard table is crowded and happy.

### Scene 112: Mateo Chasing Cats
**Time:** 2:40 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, open area
**Description:** Mateo, having finished his snack, chases Michi the gray-and-white cat across the courtyard. The cat darts between potted plants, leaps onto the fountain planter, and dashes under the rocking chair. Mateo laughs breathlessly, his dark curly hair bouncing. He crouches and wiggles a piece of string in front of the rocking chair, trying to lure Michi out. Negrito observes from a safe distance on the corredor shelf, completely uninterested in participating. Canela has retreated to Carmen's lap at the table. Carmen watches Mateo with amused eyes, calling, "Gently, Mateo, gently!" Lucia and Sofia watch from the table, laughing.

### Scene 113: Teaching Sofia to Weave
**Time:** 2:50 PM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen sits at the loom with Sofia standing beside her, eager to learn. Carmen has set up the new warp she started earlier and demonstrates the basic technique: lift the heddle, pass the shuttle through the shed, beat the weft into place. She hands the shuttle to Sofia, guiding the girl's hands. "Steady, steady," Carmen murmurs. Sofia passes the shuttle through carefully, her tongue poking out in concentration. The cream thread stretches across the warp. Carmen shows her how to use the wooden beater to press the thread into place. Their hands work together — old weathered hands guiding young smooth ones. The loom clicks and thumps.

### Scene 114: Sofia Weaving Solo
**Time:** 3:00 PM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom close-up
**Description:** Sofia sits on the low stool at the loom now, the backstrap hooked around her waist, trying to weave on her own. Her passes are uneven — the tension wobbles and the weft is not perfectly straight — but she is determined. Carmen stands beside her, one hand on Sofia's shoulder, watching with patient, encouraging eyes. "That is good, mija. The next row will be better," Carmen says. Sofia lifts the heddle, passes the shuttle, beats the weft. The rhythm is halting but improving. Camila sits on the stone floor nearby, watching her older sister with wide eyes. Canela has draped herself across Camila's lap.

### Scene 115: Teaching Camila About Plants
**Time:** 3:15 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at herb pots
**Description:** Carmen walks with Camila to the row of herb pots near the kitchen doorway. She crouches carefully beside the shy 7-year-old and picks a mint leaf, crushing it gently between her fingers and holding it to Camila's nose. Camila sniffs and smiles. "Hierbabuena," Carmen says — mint. She does the same with oregano (strong, savory) and cilantro (bright, pungent). Camila wrinkles her nose at the cilantro but giggles. Carmen shows her the rosemary bush — its needle-like leaves fragrant and woody. She teaches Camila the name of each herb, pointing to the hand-written wooden markers. Camila repeats each name in a small voice.

### Scene 116: Mateo at the Pottery Wheel
**Time:** 3:25 PM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at pottery table
**Description:** Mateo has been drawn to the pottery wheel. Carmen places a small ball of clay on the wheel head and lets Mateo kick the foot pedal. The wheel spins too fast — the clay wobbles wildly. "Slower, slower!" Carmen laughs, placing her hands over his to control the clay. Together they shape a rough, lopsided bowl — Mateo's first attempt. His hands are covered in gray clay slip, his football jersey already spotted with clay. He grins enormously. Carmen lets him squeeze and shape the clay however he wants — the result is abstract but he is proud. "I made a bowl for the cats!" he announces. Michi watches from a safe distance.

### Scene 117: Pottery Painting
**Time:** 3:40 PM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at table
**Description:** Carmen has set up a pottery painting station at the small courtyard table. She lays out three small bisque-fired pieces — a flat tile, a small cup, and a round ornament — from her shelf of pre-made pieces for painting. Small pots of ceramic paint in blue, red, yellow, green, and white sit in a row. Fine brushes and medium brushes are in a cup. Each grandchild gets a piece to paint. Camila paints tiny flowers on her tile with careful strokes. Mateo slathers his cup with bold stripes of every color. Sofia paints a geometric pattern on her ornament, copying a design she saw on Carmen's textiles. Carmen supervises, offering guidance and praise.

### Scene 118: Carmen Painting with Grandchildren
**Time:** 3:55 PM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at table close-up
**Description:** Carmen sits beside Camila, guiding the small girl's hand to paint a flower pattern on the ceramic tile. Carmen's weathered hand steadies Camila's small one, the brush tracing blue petals around a yellow center. "Very good, mi amor," Carmen murmurs. Camila beams. On the other side of the table, Mateo has gotten paint on his nose — a streak of red. Sofia is intent on her geometric design, comparing it to the textile pattern draped on the shelf nearby. Paint pots are shared, brushes dipped and rinsed in a cup of water that has turned murky brown-gray. The courtyard is warm and the light is golden.

### Scene 119: Lucia in the Kitchen
**Time:** 4:05 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at counter
**Description:** While Carmen tends to the grandchildren in the courtyard, Lucia has taken over the kitchen. She reheats the leftover cocido boyacense for the children's snack and prepares a fresh pot of aguapanela. She moves through the kitchen with the ease of someone who grew up here — she knows where everything is. She slices the bread she brought from Tunja and arranges it on a plate. She checks the refrigerator and makes a mental list of groceries her mother needs. Through the kitchen window, she watches her mother and children in the courtyard — the painting session in progress, the cats wandering, the bougainvillea vivid in the afternoon light. Lucia smiles at the scene.

### Scene 120: Afternoon Snack
**Time:** 4:15 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at small table
**Description:** The painting supplies are cleared away, and the table is reset for an afternoon snack. Lucia serves bowls of reheated cocido boyacense for the children, with sliced bread and warm aguapanela. Carmen has a cup of tinto and a piece of bread. The courtyard table is crowded and lively — three children eating, Lucia ladling seconds, Carmen watching with quiet joy. Mateo eats rapidly and messily, broth on his chin. Camila eats delicately, picking out the peas. Sofia eats with teenage self-consciousness. The painted pottery pieces dry on a shelf in the workshop, their bright colors visible from the table.

### Scene 121: Story Time
**Time:** 4:35 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, rocking chair area
**Description:** Carmen settles into the wooden rocking chair, and Camila immediately climbs onto her lap. Mateo sits cross-legged on the stone floor, and Sofia leans against a column. Carmen tells a story — a legend from Boyaca, about the Mohán, a mythical figure from the rivers. Her voice is low and dramatic, her hands gesturing. Camila's eyes are wide. Mateo leans forward. Even Sofia listens, her teenage coolness forgotten. The rocking chair creaks gently as Carmen rocks. Canela is on the arm of the rocking chair. Negrito has crept close, lying on the warm stones. The afternoon light is turning golden, casting long shadows from the courtyard columns.

### Scene 122: Carmen Telling the Story
**Time:** 4:40 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, rocking chair close-up
**Description:** Carmen's face is animated with the storytelling, her dark brown eyes bright behind the reading glasses, her wrinkled mouth forming the words with expressive precision. She raises her weathered hands — the Mohán emerges from the river! She lowers her voice to a whisper — the fisherman is afraid. Camila buries her face in Carmen's embroidered blouse, peeking out with one eye. Carmen strokes the child's long dark hair reassuringly. The gold cross necklace glints as Carmen gestures. The rocking chair sways. The story is a Boyaca tradition passed from grandmother to grandchild for generations.

### Scene 123: Playing in the Courtyard
**Time:** 4:50 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, open area
**Description:** After the story, the children play in the courtyard. Mateo has found a rubber ball and bounces it off the stone floor, counting how many times he can bounce it in a row. Camila chases Michi with a feather she found near the bougainvillea. Sofia sits on the fountain planter edge, drawing in a small sketchbook she brought in her backpack — she is sketching the courtyard, the columns, the plants. Carmen watches from the rocking chair, sipping a fresh cup of tinto Lucia brought her. Lucia sits in the second chair beside her mother. The courtyard rings with children's laughter and the thump of the bouncing ball.

### Scene 124: Lucia and Carmen Talking
**Time:** 5:00 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at rocking chair and chair
**Description:** Carmen and Lucia sit side by side, talking quietly while the children play. Lucia's hand rests on her mother's arm. They discuss family matters — Ricardo in Bogota, the grandchildren's school, Carmen's health. Carmen waves off health concerns with a dismissive hand. "I am fine, mija. I have my cats and my loom." Lucia insists Carmen see the doctor next week in Tunja. Carmen relents with a sigh. The conversation is the tender, frank exchange between a mother and her middle-aged daughter. The afternoon light is rich and golden. A neighbor's dog barks in the distance. The pendulum clock inside the house chimes five times.

### Scene 125: Preparing to Leave
**Time:** 5:15 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, gathering area
**Description:** Lucia begins gathering the children. "Time to go, we have an hour drive to Tunja." Mateo protests — he wants to stay. Camila clings to Carmen. Sofia closes her sketchbook reluctantly. The painted pottery pieces are carefully wrapped in newspaper and placed in a canvas bag for the children to take home. Carmen hugs each grandchild: Mateo gets a firm squeeze and a "Be good, mi rey." Camila gets a long, gentle hug and a kiss on the forehead. Sofia gets a hug and a whispered, "You will be a fine weaver — practice at home with the small loom I gave you."

### Scene 126: Walking to the Door
**Time:** 5:20 PM
**Setting:** Zaguan hallway, front door
**Description:** The family walks through the zaguan hallway to the front door. Carmen carries a wrapped container of leftover cocido for Lucia's family to take home. Lucia carries the canvas bag with painted pottery and the children's things. Mateo runs ahead to the door. Camila holds Carmen's free hand, walking close. The hallway is cool and dim after the bright courtyard. Carmen's leather slippers and the children's sneakers echo on the tiles. They pass the family photograph on the wall, and Carmen glances at it — the same faces, just smaller versions, walking beside her now.

### Scene 127: Goodbye at the Front Door
**Time:** 5:22 PM
**Setting:** Front entrance, street
**Description:** Carmen stands at the heavy wooden front door, watching as Lucia loads the children into the car parked on the cobblestone street. The late afternoon light is warm and golden on the whitewashed colonial facades. Mateo waves frantically from the car window. Camila's face is pressed against the glass, looking back at her grandmother. Sofia waves calmly. Lucia closes the trunk, walks back to Carmen, and hugs her once more. "I will call tonight, Mama." Carmen nods, her hand on the door frame. She waves as the car pulls away down the cobblestones, watching until it turns the corner. Then she stands alone in the doorway for a moment, the street quiet.

### Scene 128: Closing the Door
**Time:** 5:25 PM
**Setting:** Front entrance, zaguan
**Description:** Carmen closes the heavy wooden front door slowly, the iron latch clicking into place. The zaguan hallway is dim and quiet. The house feels suddenly larger without the children's voices. Carmen stands for a moment, one hand on the door, a faint wistful smile on her lined face. Then she straightens, adjusts her reading glasses, and walks back toward the courtyard. Canela appears from behind a doorway and falls into step beside her, the orange tabby's tail swishing. The visit was good. The house still holds the echo of their laughter. Carmen will see them again next weekend.

---

## PART 8: EARLY EVENING — COURTYARD AND KITCHEN (5:30 PM - 7:00 PM)

### Scene 129: Tidying the Courtyard
**Time:** 5:30 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, wide view
**Description:** Carmen moves through the courtyard, tidying up after the grandchildren's visit. She picks up the rubber ball Mateo left behind the fountain planter and places it on the shelf — he will want it next time. She collects the painting brushes left in the water cup, rinses them at the spigot, and stands them bristle-up in the ceramic cup to dry. The small pots of ceramic paint are capped and returned to the shelf. She straightens the rocking chair and pushes the small table back into position. The courtyard is peaceful in the late afternoon light, the bougainvillea glowing purple and orange against the whitewashed walls.

### Scene 130: Watering Evening Plants
**Time:** 5:38 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, at plants
**Description:** Carmen gives the potted plants a second watering — the afternoon sun has dried the soil. She fills the green watering can from the courtyard spigot and makes her rounds: the geraniums along the wall, the ferns on the corredor columns, the begonias in the fountain planter, the herbs near the kitchen door. The water darkens the terra-cotta pots. A few drops splash onto the warm stone floor and evaporate quickly. The courtyard air is cooling now as the sun drops toward the western wall. Long golden shadows stretch from the columns. Carmen deadheads a few wilted geranium flowers, pinching the spent blooms between her fingers.

### Scene 131: Covering the Loom
**Time:** 5:45 PM
**Setting:** Workshop area, at loom
**Description:** Carmen covers the loom and the new warp setup with a clean cotton cloth to protect it from the evening dew that settles in the cool mountain nights. She folds the cloth over the warp threads and heddle carefully. The finished textile runner is already stored on the shelf. She checks the drying pottery pieces from the morning — the bowl and cup are firmer now, no longer wet, entering the leather-hard stage. She covers these with a damp cloth to slow the drying and prevent cracking. The pottery shelf is neat. The yarn baskets are pushed under the shelf out of the way. The workshop is put to bed for the evening.

### Scene 132: Collecting Negrito
**Time:** 5:50 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, rocking chair area
**Description:** Carmen gently lifts Negrito the old black cat from under the rocking chair, cradling him in her arms. He is limp and relaxed, accustomed to being carried. His green eyes blink slowly. Carmen carries him toward the kitchen doorway, talking softly to him. "Come, viejo, time to go inside." Negrito is the oldest of the three cats and the most sedentary — he needs to be reminded to come inside before the mountain evening chill sets in. Canela trots alongside. Michi sits on the corredor roof, watching the sunset sky turn pink and gold above the colonial rooftop tiles.

### Scene 133: Evening Cat Feeding
**Time:** 5:55 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at floor level
**Description:** Carmen scoops cat food into the three ceramic bowls on the kitchen floor — the evening feeding. All three cats gather: Canela eats delicately, Michi pushes his face into the bowl eagerly, Negrito approaches slowly and begins to crunch kibble at a measured pace. Carmen refreshes the blue water bowl from the ceramic jug. She watches the three cats eat, standing with one hand on the counter. The kitchen is golden with sunset light through the open window. The courtyard outside is transitioning from golden to amber to purple as the sun sets behind the mountains. Carmen is still in her embroidered blouse and dark blue skirt, the craft apron removed and hung up.

### Scene 134: Heating Soup for Dinner
**Time:** 6:05 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Carmen's dinner is simple — she reheats a portion of the leftover cocido boyacense in a small clay pot on the gas stove. Elderly people often eat lightly in the evening. She adds a splash of water to thin the broth slightly and heats it gently. She does not turn on the overhead light yet — the kitchen is lit by the fading golden light through the window and the blue flame under the pot. The stew warms, filling the small kitchen with its familiar savory aroma. Carmen cuts a thick slice of the bread Lucia brought from Tunja and places it on a small plate. She pours a glass of water from the ceramic jug.

### Scene 135: Simple Dinner
**Time:** 6:15 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at table
**Description:** Carmen eats her simple dinner at the kitchen table: a small bowl of reheated cocido boyacense and a slice of bread. The overhead kitchen light is now on as the window has gone dark. She eats slowly, the day's activities catching up with her. Her reading glasses fog from the soup steam. The bread is fresh and soft — good Tunja bakery bread. She dips it into the broth, soaking up the golden liquid. Canela sits on the second chair, watching Carmen eat with hopeful eyes. Negrito has settled on his kitchen cushion — a small pillow near the radiator. The wooden pendulum clock reads six-thirty.

### Scene 136: Washing Dinner Dishes
**Time:** 6:30 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Carmen washes the few dinner dishes: the small bowl, plate, glass, and spoon. The pot is rinsed and placed upside down on the drying rack. The last of the leftover stew has been eaten — no waste in this kitchen. She wipes the table and counter, hangs the dish towel, and drains the sink. The kitchen is spotless once more. Through the window, the sky is dark blue-purple, the first stars visible above the courtyard walls. The air coming through the open window is cold now — mountain nights at 2,144 meters are brisk. Carmen closes the kitchen window shutters and latches them.

### Scene 137: Closing Courtyard Door
**Time:** 6:38 PM
**Setting:** Kitchen doorway to courtyard
**Description:** Carmen steps into the courtyard one final time to call Michi inside. The gray-and-white cat is sitting on the corredor roof, reluctant to come down. "Michi! Ven aca!" Carmen calls, clapping her hands softly. The courtyard is dark, lit only by the kitchen light spilling through the doorway and the bright stars overhead. The stone floor is cold now. The potted plants are dark silhouettes. The bougainvillea on the far wall is a dark mass against the whitewashed wall, which glows faintly blue in the starlight. Michi finally jumps down from the roof and darts through the kitchen doorway. Carmen closes and locks the courtyard door.

## PART 9: EVENING — LIVING ROOM AND BEDROOM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)

### Scene 138: Moving to the Living Room
**Time:** 7:00 PM
**Setting:** Living room, wide view
**Description:** Carmen enters the small living room, turning on a standing lamp. The room has thick whitewashed walls, dark wooden ceiling beams, and a tile floor with a large woven rug in earth tones. A faded floral sofa with crocheted armrest covers sits against one wall. A dark wooden bookcase holds volumes of Colombian literature, a Bible, photo albums, and a few framed photos. A small television sits on a low wooden table. Two upholstered armchairs face the sofa. A carved wooden coffee table holds a ceramic bowl of dried flower petals. A framed print of the Sacred Heart of Jesus hangs on the wall. The room is warm and worn and lived-in.

### Scene 139: Turning on the Television
**Time:** 7:03 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at television
**Description:** Carmen picks up the remote control from the coffee table and turns on the small television. She settles into her preferred armchair — a faded green upholstered chair with a crocheted back cover — and adjusts the pillow behind her lower back. The television shows the evening news from a Colombian channel. Carmen watches with mild interest, her reading glasses reflecting the screen's blue light. Canela jumps onto the armchair arm, and Carmen strokes the orange cat absently. Michi curls up on the sofa cushion. Negrito has found his way to his favorite spot — a warm cushion on the floor beside the standing lamp. The three cats are settled for the evening.

### Scene 140: Knitting
**Time:** 7:15 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at armchair
**Description:** Carmen reaches into a woven basket beside her armchair and pulls out a knitting project — a small scarf in forest green wool, about half-finished, attached to two dark wooden knitting needles. She begins to knit while watching television, her weathered hands working the needles with automatic skill. The green wool loops smoothly around the needles, row after row. This scarf is for Camila — a birthday gift. Carmen's knitting is as practiced as her weaving — the stitches even and tight. The clicking of the needles creates a soft, rhythmic sound in the quiet room. The television murmurs. Canela purrs on the armchair.

### Scene 141: Phone Call from Lucia
**Time:** 7:30 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at armchair
**Description:** Carmen's phone rings — an old cordless landline phone on the side table. She sets down her knitting and answers. "Alo? Si, mija." It is Lucia, calling as promised. Carmen's face warms with the conversation. She describes the grandchildren's visit as though Lucia was not there — "Mateo made a bowl! Sofia is learning the loom!" Lucia laughs through the phone. Carmen listens, nods, responds. The phone is cream-colored, old-fashioned but functional. Carmen holds it to her ear with one hand, the other resting on Canela's warm back. The television is muted. The evening is quiet and connected.

### Scene 142: Saying Goodnight to Lucia
**Time:** 7:42 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at armchair
**Description:** Carmen ends the call with Lucia. "Buenas noches, mija. Kiss the children for me. God bless you." She sets the phone back on the side table. Her expression is content — the connection to family sustains her. She picks up the knitting again, resuming the green scarf, working a few more rows. The television plays a Colombian telenovela now, but Carmen pays little attention. Her thoughts are with her family, her grandchildren, the day's visit. She yawns — the first sign of evening tiredness. The standing lamp casts a warm circle of light around her chair. Outside the living room window, the mountain night is dark and cold.

### Scene 143: Evening Rosary
**Time:** 7:50 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at armchair
**Description:** Carmen turns off the television, sets down her knitting, and picks up a rosary from the side table drawer — a different one from her bedroom rosary, this one with dark wooden beads and a brass crucifix. She settles into the armchair, fingers finding the first bead. She begins the evening rosary, lips moving in quiet prayer, fingers advancing bead by bead through the decades. Her eyes are closed. The gold cross necklace rests against her embroidered blouse. The room is quiet except for the soft murmur of prayer. The three cats are still and sleeping in their respective spots. The standing lamp gives the scene a warm, reverent glow.

### Scene 144: Finishing the Rosary
**Time:** 8:00 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at armchair
**Description:** Carmen reaches the final bead of the rosary, kisses the brass crucifix, and makes the sign of the cross. She opens her eyes with a peaceful expression. The wooden rosary beads are warm from her hands. She places them back in the side table drawer, nestling them gently. This is her nightly ritual — the rosary grounds her, connects her to faith and to Eduardo, whom she prays for every evening. She sits quietly for a moment, hands in her lap, then yawns again. It is time to prepare for bed. She reaches for the arm of the chair and pushes herself up slowly, her back stiff from sitting.

### Scene 145: Turning Off the Living Room
**Time:** 8:02 PM
**Setting:** Living room, at lamp
**Description:** Carmen walks through the living room, turning off the standing lamp. The room goes dark except for a faint glow from the hallway light. She picks up the knitting basket and places it in its spot beside the armchair. She adjusts the crocheted armrest covers on the sofa. She checks the front door — locked and latched. She turns off the hallway light. The house is dark except for the bedroom. Canela follows Carmen down the hallway. Michi stretches on the sofa and follows after a moment. Negrito is already padding toward the bedroom — he knows the routine. The three cats and their owner move through the dark hallway together.

### Scene 146: Entering the Bedroom
**Time:** 8:05 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, doorway
**Description:** Carmen enters the bedroom and turns on the reading lamp on the nightstand. The warm golden light illuminates the familiar space: the carved wooden bed with its wool blankets and crocheted bedspread, the nightstand with Don Eduardo's photograph and the Virgin Mary statue, the heavy wardrobe, the dresser with its lace doily and dried flowers. The wooden shutters are closed against the cold mountain night. The thick wool rug is warm under her slippered feet. Carmen opens the wardrobe and takes out her cream flannel nightgown, the cotton sleep cap, and the thick wool socks. She lays them on the bed.

### Scene 147: Changing for Bed
**Time:** 8:08 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen changes from her day clothes into her nightclothes. She is now wearing the cream-colored flannel nightgown with small floral print, thick wool socks, and has placed the cotton sleep cap over her silver-white hair bun. She folds her embroidered blouse, dark blue skirt, and burgundy cardigan neatly and places them on the wooden chair. The low black shoes go beside the wardrobe. Her gold cross necklace remains on — she never removes it. The reading glasses stay on for now — she will read before sleep. She pulls on a light wool bed jacket over the nightgown for warmth.

### Scene 148: Evening Bathroom Visit
**Time:** 8:12 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Carmen makes her evening bathroom visit. She washes her face again at the pedestal sink — a quick rinse with warm water and gentle pat dry with the floral hand towel. She brushes her teeth carefully, rinses, and places the toothbrush back in the cup. She applies a small amount of face cream. The bathroom light is bright overhead. The blue-and-white azulejo tiles gleam. She uses the toilet (grab bar for support), washes her hands, and dries them. Everything is practiced and efficient. The mirror reflects her nightgown-clad figure, the reading glasses, the cotton sleep cap. She turns off the bathroom light and returns to the bedroom.

### Scene 149: Checking the Cats
**Time:** 8:16 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, wide view
**Description:** Carmen checks on the three cats before settling into bed. Negrito has already claimed his spot at the foot of the bed, curled in a tight black circle on the crocheted bedspread. Canela is on the wool rug beside the bed, washing her face. Michi has jumped onto the dresser and is sniffing the dried flowers in the ceramic vase. "Down, Michi," Carmen says gently, lifting the gray-and-white cat and placing him on the rug. Michi immediately jumps back onto the bed instead, settling near Carmen's pillow. Carmen sighs and lets him stay. Three cats, three spots. The bedroom is warm and the reading lamp glows softly.

### Scene 150: Getting Into Bed
**Time:** 8:18 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen pulls back the crocheted bedspread and layers of wool blankets, sliding into the bed slowly. The sheets are cool cotton, and she pulls the heavy blankets up to her chest. The feather pillow cradles her silver-white hair. She adjusts the wool bed jacket, the flannel nightgown, the thick socks — everything layered for the cold mountain night. The carved wooden headboard is solid behind her. She reaches to the nightstand and picks up a book — a worn paperback novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, "Love in the Time of Cholera," which she has read many times. A woven bookmark marks her place.

### Scene 151: Reading in Bed
**Time:** 8:20 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed close-up
**Description:** Carmen reads her Garcia Marquez novel, the reading lamp casting warm light on the yellowed pages. Her round gold-framed reading glasses sit precisely on her nose. She holds the book in both hands, her weathered fingers curving around the spine. The familiar words of the story are comforting — she reads slowly, savoring each sentence. Michi has settled against her side, purring. Negrito sleeps at her feet. Canela has jumped onto the bed and lies between Carmen's ankles. The bedroom is quiet and warm, cocoon-like. The thick whitewashed walls block all outside sound. Only the soft turning of pages disturbs the silence.

### Scene 152: Touching the Photograph
**Time:** 8:25 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, nightstand close-up
**Description:** Carmen sets the book down, marking her place with the woven bookmark. She turns to the nightstand and picks up the framed black-and-white photograph of Don Eduardo. In the photo, he is younger — perhaps fifty — standing in front of the Villa de Leyva parish church, wearing a suit and tie, smiling with gentle eyes. Carmen holds the photo in both hands, her thumbs on the dark wooden frame. She studies his face, as she does every night. "Buenas noches, mi amor," she whispers. Then she places the photo back on the nightstand, positioned just so, facing the bed. Her eyes are bright with memory but not with tears.

### Scene 153: Evening Prayer
**Time:** 8:26 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen clasps her hands over the blankets and closes her eyes for a brief evening prayer. Her lips move silently — thanking God for the day, for the grandchildren's visit, for her health, asking blessings for Lucia and Ricardo and the grandchildren, praying for Eduardo's soul. The rosary beads on the Virgin Mary statue gleam in the lamplight. The crucifix on the wall watches over her. It is a moment of deep, practiced faith — the same prayer, with variations, that she has said every night for decades. Her expression is serene. The cats are still. The house is silent.

### Scene 154: Removing Reading Glasses
**Time:** 8:28 AM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, nightstand
**Description:** Carmen opens her eyes, crosses herself, and removes her round gold-framed reading glasses. She folds them carefully and places them in the dark brown leather case on the nightstand, clicking it shut. Without the glasses, her face looks softer, her dark brown eyes slightly unfocused. She checks the nightstand one last time — photo in place, Virgin Mary with rosary, reading lamp, glasses case, Eduardo's leather watch. Everything is where it should be. She adjusts the cotton sleep cap on her hair, pulling it snug.

### Scene 155: Turning Off the Lamp
**Time:** 8:29 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Carmen reaches for the reading lamp and clicks it off. The bedroom plunges into darkness, then gradually the faint moonlight seeping through the gaps in the wooden shutters becomes visible — cool silver light painting thin stripes on the terra-cotta floor and the wool rug. The room is dark, warm, and safe. The thick adobe walls hold the warmth. The heavy wool blankets are pulled up to Carmen's chin. The crocheted bedspread lies smooth on top. Three cats are warm weights on the bed. The house is quiet, the mountain night cold outside, the stars brilliant over Villa de Leyva's colonial rooftops.

### Scene 156: Settling Into Sleep
**Time:** 8:30 PM
**Setting:** Carmen's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Carmen lies on her back, hands crossed on her chest over the blankets, eyes closed. Her breathing slows, deepening toward sleep. The gold cross necklace rests against the flannel nightgown under the blankets. Her lined face is relaxed, the deep wrinkles softened in the darkness. Negrito shifts at the foot of the bed, finding a more comfortable position. Michi is a warm presence against her hip. Canela has settled between her ankles. The moonlight stripes on the floor shift imperceptibly as the night moves. The framed photograph of Don Eduardo faces the bed in the darkness. Dona Carmen sleeps.

## SUPPLEMENTAL SCENES: ADDITIONAL DAILY MOMENTS

### Scene 157: Sweeping the Courtyard
**Time:** 10:30 AM (alternate day activity)
**Setting:** Courtyard, wide view
**Description:** Carmen sweeps the stone courtyard floor with a straw broom (escoba de millo), the traditional Colombian broom made from millet stalks tied to a wooden handle. She sweeps methodically from the corredor toward the fountain, gathering fallen bougainvillea petals, dried leaves, and dust into a small pile. The purple and orange petals contrast against the gray stone. Her movements are steady and rhythmic — sweep, sweep, step forward, sweep. The broom scratches on the stone. Michi chases the moving broom bristles, pouncing and scattering the leaf pile. Carmen shakes her head but smiles. The morning sun warms the stone. Her craft apron protects her blouse.

### Scene 158: At the Saturday Market
**Time:** 9:00 AM (Saturday)
**Setting:** Villa de Leyva main plaza, market stall
**Description:** Carmen sits behind a small market table on the edge of the massive cobblestone main plaza of Villa de Leyva — one of the largest town squares in Colombia. Her table displays her handmade goods: woven textile runners, small pottery bowls and vases, knitted scarves. A cloth canopy shades the stall. She wears her going-out clothes — the best embroidered blouse, clean dark skirt, black wool shawl against the morning cool, small gold earrings. A tourist couple examines a red-and-cream textile runner. Carmen describes the traditional diamond pattern. The colonial whitewashed buildings with dark green wooden balconies frame the enormous cobblestone plaza. Other market vendors sell fruits, cheese, and crafts nearby.

### Scene 159: Receiving a Letter
**Time:** 11:00 AM (alternate activity)
**Setting:** Living room, at armchair
**Description:** Carmen sits in her green armchair with a handwritten letter from her son Ricardo in Bogota. The envelope, already opened, sits on the side table. She holds the letter — two pages of neat handwriting on lined paper — close to her reading glasses. Ricardo writes about Andresito's school grades, his engineering project, city life. Carmen reads slowly, savoring each word. She smiles at a joke Ricardo included. A small photograph falls from between the pages — Andresito in his school uniform, grinning. Carmen holds the photo up to the lamp light, studying her grandson's face. She will write back this afternoon, at the kitchen table, with her fountain pen and cream stationery.

### Scene 160: Sunset from the Courtyard
**Time:** 6:00 PM
**Setting:** Courtyard, rocking chair
**Description:** Carmen sits in the rocking chair in the courtyard, wrapped in the black wool ruana shawl, watching the sunset over the colonial rooftops. The sky is a spectacular display of orange, pink, and deep purple — the Boyaca highland sunsets are famous for their intensity at altitude. The whitewashed courtyard walls glow warm peach in the dying light. The potted plants are gilded. The bougainvillea is a dark silhouette against the blazing sky. Canela sits on the armrest of the rocking chair. Negrito lies on Carmen's feet. Michi perches on the corredor column, a dark silhouette against the sunset. The air is cooling rapidly. Carmen rocks slowly, the chair creaking, watching the sky change color minute by minute, at peace with the day, the town, and her quiet life.
