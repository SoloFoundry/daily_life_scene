# A Day in the Life of Catalina: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating realistic educational images depicting a full day in the life of Catalina, a 21-year-old Colombian university student living in Bogotá.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, Spanish language learners, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context within Latin American/Colombian culture.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in Colombian cultural context (arepa on breakfast table, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines in Latin America
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Repetition of locations (shared family spaces) reinforces learning
- Colombian cultural context embedded naturally
- Bilingual environment (Spanish signage, products with Spanish labels)

### Companion Document

**📄 `image_generation_pipeline.md`** — Contains the technical pipeline for automated image generation, including:
- Full project context and key decisions made
- Pipeline architecture diagram
- Required software and models (all free)
- Directory structure
- Location asset requirements
- Lighting presets and prompt templates
- Automation scripts structure
- Troubleshooting guide

**How These Documents Work Together:**
- This file (`catalina_daily_life_scenes.md`) = **WHAT** to generate (scene content)
- Pipeline file (`image_generation_pipeline.md`) = **HOW** to generate (technical infrastructure)

**When continuing this project in a new chat:** Provide both documents to Claude for full context.

### This Document as a Template

This document demonstrates how the Matt template can be adapted for different characters, cultures, and contexts:

**Key Differences from Matt's Document:**
- **Gender:** Female (different clothing, personal care items, routines)
- **Age:** 21 (university student vs. working professional)
- **Culture:** Colombian/Latina (different food, products, cultural norms)
- **Location:** Bogotá, Colombia (different architecture, climate, urban environment)
- **Living Situation:** Family home with parents and siblings (shared spaces vs. solo apartment)
- **Transportation:** Public transit (TransMilenio) vs. personal car
- **Daily Focus:** University classes vs. office work
- **Language:** Bilingual environment with Spanish signage and products

---

### Scene Description Format

Each scene in this document follows the same consistent format as Matt's document:

```
### Scene [NUMBER]: [TITLE]
**Time:** [TIME] — [LIGHTING CONDITION]
**Setting:** [LOCATION], [CAMERA ANGLE/VIEW]
**Description:** [DETAILED PARAGRAPH INCLUDING:]
  - Character appearance and clothing
  - Character action/pose
  - All visible objects with details (color, material, Spanish brand names if relevant)
  - Room/environment details (Colombian style)
  - Lighting quality and direction
  - Atmospheric details
```

**Key principles maintained:**
- Third-person perspective (character visible in scene)
- Extremely granular (each small action = separate scene)
- Object-rich (every visible object mentioned)
- Sensory details (textures, materials, colors, lighting)
- Consistent character (same clothing within time periods)
- Logical flow (scenes connect naturally)
- **Cultural authenticity** (Colombian products, architecture, customs)

---

**Time:** 6:00 AM — dark blue pre-dawn light through curtains
**Setting:** Bedroom, viewed from doorway
**Description:** A 21-year-old Colombian woman with long dark brown hair lies in bed under a colorful floral comforter (typical Colombian pattern with bright yellows, pinks, and blues). On the small wooden nightstand beside her bed, a smartphone screen glows brightly, displaying "6:00 AM" with an alarm ringing. A simple white lamp with a fabric shade sits next to a framed photo of her family. A glass of water is half-full next to the phone. The window has light blue curtains, partially open, allowing thin strips of dark blue early morning light into the room. Walls are painted warm cream color. A poster of a Colombian singer is visible on the wall.

### Scene 002: Reaching for the Phone

**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** A woman's hand with painted nails (light pink) emerges from under the floral comforter, reaching toward the glowing smartphone on the wooden nightstand. Her fingers are about to touch the screen to dismiss the alarm. The phone screen shows the alarm with Spanish text "Alarma" and a "Descartar" button. The bedside lamp, water glass, and family photo are visible in the background. Soft blue morning light from the window illuminates the scene.

She hunches slightly forward, rubbing her eyes with one hand, her long dark hair messy and tangled. The floral comforter is pushed aside, revealing white sheets with small embroidered flowers. A wooden bed frame with a simple headboard is visible. On the floor beside the bed are white slip-on sandals (chanclas). The nightstand with phone, water, and family photo is beside her. A small wooden dresser with a mirror stands against the far wall, with several hair products visible on top.

**Time:** 6:02 AM — growing morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, full room view
**Description:** Catalina stands beside the window, arms raised above her head in a full-body stretch, wearing her pink t-shirt and gray pajama shorts. Her eyes are closed, face tilted slightly upward, long dark hair hanging down her back. The light blue curtains are still mostly closed. The bed is unmade behind her, the colorful floral comforter bunched to one side. A full-length mirror on the closet door (armario) reflects her stretching figure. In the corner, a small desk holds a stack of university textbooks and a closed laptop. A mochila (backpack) hangs on a chair.

### Scene 005: Opening the Curtains
**Time:** 6:03 AM — early morning light flooding in
**Setting:** Bedroom, view toward window
**Description:** Catalina's hand pulls the light blue curtain aside, revealing the view outside. Bright early morning sunlight begins to stream through, casting soft golden light across the room. Through the window, a typical Bogotá residential neighborhood is visible: neighboring houses with terracotta roofs, greenery, mountains (Andes) in the far distance partially covered in morning mist, and a clothesline in the backyard. Catalina's face is lit by the warm morning sun, eyes slightly squinted against the brightness. The room transitions from dim blue to warm golden light.
