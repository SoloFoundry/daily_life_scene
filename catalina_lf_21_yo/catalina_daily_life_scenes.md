# A Day in the Life of Catalina: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating realistic educational images depicting a full day in the life of Catalina, a 21-year-old Colombian university student living in Bogota.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, Spanish language learners, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context within Latin American/Colombian culture.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in Colombian cultural context (arepa on breakfast table, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines in Latin America
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Repetition of locations (shared family spaces) reinforces learning
- Colombian cultural context embedded naturally
- Bilingual environment (Spanish signage, products with Spanish labels)

### This Document as a Template

This document demonstrates how the Matt template can be adapted for different characters, cultures, and contexts:

**Key Differences from Matt's Document:**
- **Gender:** Female (different clothing, personal care items, routines)
- **Age:** 21 (university student vs. working professional)
- **Culture:** Colombian/Latina (different food, products, cultural norms)
- **Location:** Bogota, Colombia (different architecture, climate, urban environment)
- **Living Situation:** Family home with parents and siblings (shared spaces vs. solo apartment)
- **Transportation:** Public transit (TransMilenio) vs. personal car
- **Daily Focus:** University classes vs. office work
- **Language:** Bilingual environment with Spanish signage and products

---

### Scene Description Format

Each scene in this document follows the same consistent format as Matt's document:

```
### Scene [NUMBER]: [TITLE]
**Time:** [TIME] — [LIGHTING CONDITION]
**Setting:** [LOCATION], [CAMERA ANGLE/VIEW]
**Description:** [DETAILED PARAGRAPH INCLUDING:]
  - Character appearance and clothing
  - Character action/pose
  - All visible objects with details (color, material, Spanish brand names if relevant)
  - Room/environment details (Colombian style)
  - Lighting quality and direction
  - Atmospheric details
```

**Key principles maintained:**
- Third-person perspective (character visible in scene)
- Extremely granular (each small action = separate scene)
- Object-rich (every visible object mentioned)
- Sensory details (textures, materials, colors, lighting)
- Consistent character (same clothing within time periods)
- Logical flow (scenes connect naturally)
- **Cultural authenticity** (Colombian products, architecture, customs)

## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — CATALINA'S BEDROOM (6:00 AM - 6:20 AM)

### Scene 001: The Alarm
**Time:** 6:00 AM — dark blue pre-dawn light through curtains
**Setting:** Bedroom, viewed from doorway
**Description:** A 21-year-old Colombian woman with long dark brown hair lies in bed under a colorful floral comforter (typical Colombian pattern with bright yellows, pinks, and blues). On the small wooden nightstand beside her bed, a smartphone screen glows brightly, displaying "6:00 AM" with an alarm ringing. A simple white lamp with a fabric shade sits next to a framed photo of her family. A glass of water is half-full next to the phone. The window has light blue curtains, partially open, allowing thin strips of dark blue early morning light into the room. Walls are painted warm cream color. A poster of a Colombian singer is visible on the wall. The tile floor is cool and dark in the pre-dawn shadows.

### Scene 002: Reaching for the Phone
**Time:** 6:00 AM — dark pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** A woman's hand with painted nails (light pink) emerges from under the floral comforter, reaching toward the glowing smartphone on the wooden nightstand. Her fingers are about to touch the screen to dismiss the alarm. The phone screen shows the alarm with Spanish text "Alarma" and a "Descartar" button. The bedside lamp, water glass, and family photo are visible in the background. Soft blue morning light from the window illuminates the scene. The woman's face is partially visible, eyes squinting, still sleepy, long dark hair spread on the white pillow.

### Scene 003: Dismissing the Alarm
**Time:** 6:01 AM — dark pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on phone screen
**Description:** Catalina's thumb swipes across the smartphone screen, dismissing the alarm. The screen transitions from the alarm display to the lock screen, showing a wallpaper photo of Catalina with her university friends. The time "6:01" appears in white numbers. Several notification badges are visible — WhatsApp messages, an Instagram notification, a university email. The phone rests on the wooden nightstand surface, the glow illuminating the water glass and the small white lamp beside it.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 6:02 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, side view
**Description:** Catalina sits on the edge of her bed, bare feet touching the cool tile floor (typical Colombian flooring), wearing a pink cotton t-shirt and gray pajama shorts. She hunches slightly forward, rubbing her eyes with one hand, her long dark hair messy and tangled. The floral comforter is pushed aside, revealing white sheets with small embroidered flowers. A wooden bed frame with a simple headboard is visible. On the floor beside the bed are white slip-on sandals (chanclas). The nightstand with phone, water, and family photo is beside her. A small wooden dresser with a mirror stands against the far wall, with several hair products visible on top.

### Scene 005: Drinking Water
**Time:** 6:03 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on nightstand area
**Description:** Catalina reaches for the half-full glass of water on the nightstand and brings it to her lips, taking a long drink. Her eyes are still half-closed, hair falling across her face. The cool water wets her lips. She holds the glass with both hands, condensation droplets on the outside of the glass. The framed family photo shows her parents, Daniel, and a younger Catalina at a park. The phone screen has gone dark on the nightstand.

### Scene 006: Stretching by the Window
**Time:** 6:04 AM — growing morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, full room view
**Description:** Catalina stands beside the window, arms raised above her head in a full-body stretch, wearing her pink t-shirt and gray pajama shorts. Her eyes are closed, face tilted slightly upward, long dark hair hanging down her back. The light blue curtains are still mostly closed. The bed is unmade behind her, the colorful floral comforter bunched to one side. A full-length mirror on the closet door (armario) reflects her stretching figure. In the corner, a small desk holds a stack of university textbooks and a closed laptop. A mochila (backpack) hangs on a chair. Her white chanclas are on her feet now.

### Scene 007: Opening the Curtains
**Time:** 6:05 AM — early morning light flooding in
**Setting:** Bedroom, view toward window
**Description:** Catalina's hand pulls the light blue curtain aside, revealing the view outside. Bright early morning sunlight begins to stream through, casting soft golden light across the room. Through the window, a typical Bogota residential neighborhood is visible: neighboring houses with terracotta roofs, greenery, mountains (Andes) in the far distance partially covered in morning mist, and a clothesline in the backyard. Catalina's face is lit by the warm morning sun, eyes slightly squinted against the brightness. The room transitions from dim blue to warm golden light. A bird perches on a wire outside.

### Scene 008: Checking Phone Messages
**Time:** 6:06 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, sitting on bed edge
**Description:** Catalina sits back on the edge of the bed, scrolling through her phone. The screen shows WhatsApp conversations in Spanish — a group chat called "Psico 3er Semestre" with messages from classmates about today's assignment, and a message from her friend Laura asking about meeting before class. Catalina's thumbs move across the screen, typing a quick reply. Morning sunlight from the now-open curtains warms the side of her face. Her legs dangle off the bed, chanclas on her feet, hair still tangled from sleep.

### Scene 009: Choosing Clothes from Closet
**Time:** 6:08 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at armario (closet)
**Description:** Catalina stands before an open wooden armario with her hand reaching for clothes. Inside, casual university clothes hang on plastic hangers — jeans, t-shirts, a couple of blouses, a denim jacket, a light rain jacket. Below them, a few pairs of shoes are lined up: white sneakers (tenis), sandals, and casual flats. On a shelf above, folded sweaters and a small box are visible. She selects a white t-shirt and dark blue jeans. Her hair is still down and messy from sleep. Morning sunlight illuminates the interior of the closet, casting shadows on the folded fabrics.

### Scene 010: Choosing Hoodie
**Time:** 6:09 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at armario
**Description:** Catalina reaches deeper into the armario and pulls out a light gray hoodie from a shelf. She holds it up briefly, checking for wrinkles, then drapes it over her arm with the white t-shirt and jeans. The hoodie has a small embroidered logo on the chest. Other folded hoodies and sweaters are visible on the shelf — essential for Bogota's cool mornings. A light rain jacket hangs at the end of the closet rod, ready for the city's unpredictable weather.

### Scene 011: Clothes Laid on Bed
**Time:** 6:10 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, view of bed
**Description:** On top of the partially made bed with the floral comforter, a university outfit is laid out: a white cotton t-shirt, dark blue skinny jeans, a light gray hoodie, and white ankle socks. A pair of white sneakers (tenis) sits on the floor beside the bed. A black canvas mochila (backpack) leans against the bed frame. The morning sun casts warm light across the fabric. Catalina is not visible in the frame — just the prepared outfit waiting on the bed. The colorful floral comforter provides a vibrant backdrop beneath the clothing.

### Scene 012: Gathering Towel and Toiletries
**Time:** 6:12 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at dresser
**Description:** Catalina opens a drawer of the wooden dresser and pulls out a folded blue towel with a decorative border. She places it over her arm, then picks up a small fabric toiletry bag from the dresser top — it is pink with a zipper and contains her personal bathroom items. Hair products, a small jewelry box, and a framed photo of friends line the dresser surface. The mirror above reflects her sleep-rumpled appearance. She turns toward the bedroom door, ready to head to the bathroom.

Family photos in wooden frames line the wall — wedding photos, school portraits, a family vacation shot. A small console table with a decorative plant and a ceramic bowl for keys sits against one wall. Morning light from a window at the end of the hallway illuminates the space. A closed door to Daniel's bedroom is visible across the hall.

### Scene 014: Waiting for Bathroom
**Time:** 6:20 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Hallway outside bathroom
**Description:** Catalina stands in the hallway outside the closed bathroom door, holding her towel and small toiletry bag, wearing her pink t-shirt and gray pajama shorts. Her long dark hair is in a messy bun she has just twisted up. The bathroom door is white with a frosted glass panel, light visible from inside indicating someone is using it (her younger brother Daniel). She leans against the wall, looking slightly impatient, checking her phone while waiting. The sound of running water is suggested from behind the door.

### Scene 015: Door Opening — Daniel Exits
**Time:** 6:24 AM — bright hallway light
**Setting:** Hallway, bathroom doorway
**Description:** The bathroom door swings open and Daniel (16, wearing his school uniform — white polo shirt and dark pants, hair freshly gelled) steps out carrying his own toiletry bag. He and Catalina exchange a quick greeting — he says "Buenos dias" with a sleepy expression. Steam wisps escape from the bathroom behind him. Catalina steps aside to let him pass, then moves toward the open doorway. The hallway light mixes with the bright fluorescent light spilling from the bathroom.

### Scene 016: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:25 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom doorway
**Description:** Catalina walks through the bathroom doorway, hand on the light switch (already on), carrying her towel and toiletry bag. The bathroom is small but clean: white and blue tiles on walls (typical Colombian style), white tile floor, a single vanity with white sink and chrome faucet, a large mirror above, and a white toilet beside it. A shower area with a plastic curtain (floral pattern) is visible. Colorful towels hang on chrome bars. A small window with frosted glass lets in natural light. Various family toiletries are organized on a shelf. A faint trace of steam from Daniel's shower lingers in the air.

### Scene 017: Closing Bathroom Door
**Time:** 6:25 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom interior, view toward door
**Description:** Catalina's hand pushes the white bathroom door closed behind her. The frosted glass panel darkens as the hallway light is blocked. She turns the small chrome lock on the door handle. Her towel is draped over the chrome towel bar, and her pink toiletry bag sits on the edge of the sink counter. The bathroom's overhead fluorescent light casts bright, even illumination across the blue and white tiles. A small woven basket on a shelf holds extra toilet paper rolls.

### Scene 018: Looking in the Mirror
**Time:** 6:26 AM — bright fluorescent light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Catalina stands before the bathroom mirror, examining her face. Her reflection shows sleepy eyes with slight dark circles, messy dark hair in a bun, medium brown skin. Both hands rest on the white sink edge. The chrome faucet gleams under the bright overhead fluorescent light. Multiple toothbrushes in a holder (family's toothbrushes — pink, blue, green, yellow) sit to the right. A tube of Colgate toothpaste, a bar of soap in a ceramic dish, and a small potted succulent are on the left side of the sink. Various hair products (gel, spray) are visible on a small shelf above.

### Scene 019: Turning on Faucet
**Time:** 6:26 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on sink
**Description:** Close-up of Catalina's hands turning the chrome faucet handle. Water begins to flow from the spout into the white porcelain sink basin.

### Scene 020: Washing Face
**Time:** 6:27 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Catalina leans over the sink, splashing water onto her face with cupped hands. The chrome faucet runs cold water.

A towel with floral embroidery hangs nearby on a ring. Her messy bun wobbles slightly as she leans forward.

### Scene 021: Drying Face
**Time:** 6:28 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Catalina presses a small hand towel against her face, patting dry the water. Her eyes are hidden behind the towel fabric. Her reflection is partially visible in the mirror — the towel pressed to her face, dark hair in the messy bun. The faucet is turned off now, water droplets on the porcelain. The pink toiletry bag sits unzipped on the counter, revealing bottles and tubes inside. Her pink t-shirt has a small wet spot near the collar.

### Scene 022: Applying Toothpaste
**Time:** 6:29 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on hands

The blue and white tile pattern provides the background.

### Scene 023: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 6:30 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror

Various family toiletries are visible on shelves and the counter. Water droplets pool on the tile floor near the shower.

### Scene 043: Wiping Mirror
**Time:** 6:56 AM — bathroom with clearing steam
**Setting:** Bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Catalina's hand wipes a section of the fogged bathroom mirror with a hand towel, creating a clear streak. Her partial reflection becomes visible through the cleared area — wet face, towel-wrapped hair. Condensation drips down the glass around the cleared section. The fluorescent vanity light glows above. The blue towel is wrapped around her torso. The cleared portion of the mirror expands with each swipe, revealing more of her reflection.

### Scene 044: Applying Face Cream
**Time:** 6:57 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink

The towel-turban is still on her head, the blue towel wrapped around her body.

### Scene 045: Rubbing in Face Cream
**Time:** 6:58 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Catalina uses both hands to gently rub the moisturizer into her face, making small circular motions on her cheeks, forehead, and nose. Her eyes are closed as her fingertips work the cream into her medium brown skin. The mirror reflection shows her careful application. The cream absorbs, leaving a slight dewy sheen. The toiletry bag sits open on the counter beside her, tubes and bottles visible inside.

### Scene 046: Gathering Belongings
**Time:** 6:59 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at counter
**Description:** Catalina zips up her pink toiletry bag, having replaced all her products inside. She picks up her folded pajamas (pink t-shirt and gray shorts) from the edge of the counter where she placed them.

She tucks the toiletry bag under her arm.

### Scene 047: Returning to Bedroom
**Time:** 7:00 AM — bright hallway
**Setting:** Bathroom doorway to hallway
**Description:** Catalina exits the bathroom into the hallway, blue towel wrapped around her, hair wrapped in turban, carrying her toiletry bag and pajamas.

Morning sunlight fills the room through the open curtain, casting warm rectangles of light on the tile floor. She walks toward the bed. The dresser with mirror is visible, hair products and accessories scattered on top. Her mochila leans against the bed frame. The Colombian singer poster is bright in the morning light.

### Scene 052: Blow-Drying Hair
**Time:** 7:04 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at dresser

### Scene 053: Finishing Hair — Checking Result
**Time:** 7:08 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at mirror
**Description:** Catalina sets down the hairdryer on the dresser and examines her hair in the mirror. It is mostly dry now — dark, wavy, and voluminous, falling past her shoulders. She turns her head side to side, checking the result. A few damp sections near the nape remain. She runs her fingers through the strands one final time, fluffing the roots.

**Description:** Catalina pulls the white cotton t-shirt over her head, arms raised, fabric bunching around her arms and head mid-motion. She's wearing the dark jeans. Her long dark hair gets momentarily caught in the shirt collar and she pulls it free with one hand, sweeping it out from under the fabric. The gray hoodie remains on the bed. The room shows morning activity — bed messier from gathering clothes, towel on chair, toiletry bag on dresser.

### Scene 057: Putting on Socks
**Time:** 7:11 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, sitting on bed edge
**Description:** Catalina sits on the edge of the bed, pulling on white ankle socks one at a time. Her right foot is propped on her left knee as she stretches the sock over her toes and heel. The white sneakers (tenis) sit on the tile floor in front of her, laces loosened and ready. She wears the jeans and white t-shirt now. Her hair falls forward as she leans down, dark waves partially obscuring her face. A laundry hamper with her damp towels is visible in the corner.

### Scene 058: Putting on Sneakers
**Time:** 7:12 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on floor
**Description:** Catalina slides her right foot into a white canvas sneaker, using her index finger to pull up the heel counter.

Her dark jeans are cuffed slightly at the ankles, showing the white socks beneath.

### Scene 059: Tying Sneakers
**Time:** 7:13 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Catalina's hands tying the white laces of her sneakers. The laces cross and loop, fingers pulling them tight into a bow.

### Scene 060: Putting on Hoodie
**Time:** 7:14 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, full view
**Description:** Catalina slips the light gray hoodie over her white t-shirt, pulling it down over her torso. The hood falls onto her back. She is now fully dressed for university — jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, sneakers. Her long dark hair is down and wavy from the blow-dry, falling over the hoodie. She tugs the hoodie hem, settling it at her hips. The small embroidered logo on the chest is visible. The bed behind her is now empty of clothing, just the floral comforter.

### Scene 061: Final Check in Mirror
**Time:** 7:15 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at full-length mirror
**Description:** Catalina stands before the full-length mirror on the armario door, giving herself a final once-over. Her reflection shows the complete university outfit: gray hoodie over white t-shirt, dark blue skinny jeans, white sneakers. Her long dark wavy hair frames her face. She adjusts the hoodie slightly, straightens her ponytail — no, her hair is down today. She gives a small nod of approval. The morning sun lights the room behind her, the unmade area of the bed and the dresser visible in the mirror's edges.

The kitchen table is set for breakfast. Her mother (mama, around 45, wearing a floral apron over a house dress, dark hair pulled back) stands at the stove. Her father (papa, around 48, in a button-down shirt and slacks ready for work) sits at the table reading "El Tiempo" newspaper.

The table is set with colorful ceramic plates (handmade Colombian style with painted flowers), glasses of fresh orange juice, a basket of sliced bread (pan tajado), and a ceramic butter dish.

Their mother watches from the stove with an amused expression. Daniel's school backpack (a dark blue Totto brand, popular in Colombia) sits on the floor beside his chair. A glass of orange juice and an empty plate wait in front of him.

### Scene 067: Sitting at Table
**Time:** 7:19 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, family at breakfast table
**Description:** The family of four sits around the wooden kitchen table for breakfast. Catalina sits next to her brother, across from her father, with her mother at the head near the stove. The table is full of traditional Colombian breakfast items: arepas (golden corn cakes) stacked on a plate, scrambled eggs (huevos revueltos) in a yellow bowl, sliced avocado fanning out on a small plate, crumbled queso fresco, bread in a basket, butter dish, and a bowl of fresh tropical fruit (sliced papaya, mango, and banana). The moka pot of hot coffee sits on a trivet in the center beside a small pitcher of warm milk. Everyone has a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice.

The hot griddle is visible in the background on the stove, flame still low beneath it.

### Scene 069: Buttering Arepa
**Time:** 7:21 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at table
**Description:** Close-up of Catalina's hands spreading butter on a hot arepa with a knife.

Her light pink painted nails contrast with the knife handle.

### Scene 070: Adding Queso Fresco
**Time:** 7:22 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at table

### Scene 071: Father Pouring Coffee
**Time:** 7:23 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table

### Scene 072: Adding Milk to Coffee
**Time:** 7:24 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up on mug
**Description:** Catalina pours warm milk from a small white ceramic pitcher into her mug of hot black coffee. The white milk swirls into the dark coffee, creating light brown cafe con leche patterns as it mixes. Her hand tilts the pitcher carefully, controlling the stream. The mug sits on the checkered tablecloth. Steam rises from the mixture. The cafe con leche settles into a warm caramel color — the classic Colombian way to drink morning coffee.

### Scene 073: Stirring Coffee
**Time:** 7:24 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up on mug
**Description:** A small spoon circles inside the ceramic mug, blending the coffee and milk together. Catalina's fingers hold the spoon handle, creating a gentle vortex in the cafe con leche.

Steam curls up from the surface.

### Scene 074: First Sip of Coffee
**Time:** 7:25 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Catalina raises the ceramic mug to her lips, taking a careful first sip of the hot cafe con leche. Her eyes close briefly in appreciation — the rich Colombian coffee flavor.

Her family eats around her, the comfortable sounds of breakfast filling the kitchen.

### Scene 075: Eating Breakfast — Bite of Arepa
**Time:** 7:26 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Catalina bites into the buttered, cheese-topped arepa, the warm corn cake crunching slightly at the edge. Her mouth opens around the golden bread, queso fresco crumbles catching on her lip. The arepa shows the bite mark, revealing the soft white interior beneath the golden crust. Melted butter glistens. Her coffee mug steams beside her plate. The family eats together, a warm Colombian breakfast scene with quiet conversation in Spanish suggested by their animated expressions.

### Scene 076: Eating Scrambled Eggs
**Time:** 7:28 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at table
**Description:** Catalina scoops scrambled eggs (huevos revueltos, Colombian style with diced tomato and chopped green onion visible) onto her fork.

The checkered tablecloth frames the scene.

### Scene 077: Family Conversation at Breakfast
**Time:** 7:30 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, full table view
**Description:** The family eats together, engaged in animated conversation in Spanish. Catalina gestures while talking, holding her fork, describing something about her upcoming class. Her mother listens attentively while spreading butter on bread. Her father has set down the newspaper and contributes to the conversation. Daniel checks his phone under the table (mama giving him a disapproving look). Plates are partially eaten — arepas broken apart, eggs diminished, avocado slices taken. Coffee mugs are half-full. A warm, busy family breakfast scene typical of Colombian households.

### Scene 078: Eating Fruit
**Time:** 7:33 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Catalina spears a piece of sliced mango from the fruit bowl with her fork and brings it to her mouth. The ripe mango is bright orange-yellow, glistening with juice.

### Scene 079: Checking Phone for Time
**Time:** 7:38 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Catalina picks up her smartphone from the table, checking the time. The screen shows "7:38 AM" clearly. Her expression shifts to slight urgency — she needs to leave soon to catch her TransMilenio bus. Her plate is mostly empty, just arepa crumbs and a small bit of egg remaining. Her coffee mug is nearly drained, a ring of cafe con leche at the bottom. Her mochila sits on the floor beside her chair, ready to go. She sets the phone down and takes a last gulp of coffee.

### Scene 080: Standing from Table
**Time:** 7:40 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, rising from table
**Description:** Catalina pushes her chair back and stands from the table, picking up her empty plate and coffee mug. Her napkin is placed on the table. Her mother is still seated, finishing her own coffee and talking with papa. Daniel has already finished and is gathering his school backpack, slinging it over one shoulder.

### Scene 081: Carrying Dishes to Sink
**Time:** 7:41 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, walking to sink
**Description:** Catalina carries her plate stacked with the mug on top across the kitchen toward the sink. She steps carefully, the ceramic dishes balanced.

### Scene 082: Rinsing Dishes at Sink
**Time:** 7:41 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Catalina rinses her plate and mug under running water at the kitchen sink. The chrome faucet runs, water splashing over the dishes. Her hands hold the plate under the stream, food remnants washing away. Through the window above the sink, the backyard is visible — a clothesline with laundry, potted plants, neighboring houses with terracotta roofs, and the green hills of Bogota in the distance. The colorful tile backsplash (blue, yellow, red pattern) frames the window.

### Scene 083: Kissing Mother Goodbye
**Time:** 7:43 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, near doorway

Her mother's face shows the tender expression of a parent sending a child off. The kitchen is warm and golden behind them. Papa waves from the table with his coffee cup raised, and Daniel is already heading toward the front door for school.

The backpack has university pins and a small Colombian flag keychain attached to the main zipper pull. She stands near the front door of the house. A small wooden table by the door holds a ceramic bowl for keys, a decorative plant, and family photos.

**Setting:** Near front door, close-up on backpack

She zips it back up, satisfied everything is there. Her phone is in her hand. A light rain jacket hangs on a hook nearby (in case of rain — Bogota weather is unpredictable).

### Scene 086: Opening Front Door
**Time:** 7:47 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Front door, interior view
**Description:** Catalina turns the deadbolt lock and opens the heavy wooden front door of the house, morning sunlight streaming in brightly. The door has decorative metalwork (reja) for security, typical of Colombian homes — black iron bars in a geometric pattern. The street beyond is visible — a typical Bogota residential neighborhood with houses, small gardens, parked cars, and paved sidewalks. She steps through the doorway, her mochila on her back, phone in her hand. The interior hallway with its cream walls and family photos is behind her.

### Scene 087: Stepping Outside
**Time:** 7:47 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Front of house, exterior
**Description:** Catalina steps out onto the front stoop of her family's house, pulling the door closed behind her. The house facade is painted a warm yellow with white trim, a small front garden with tropical plants (bird of paradise, ferns) flanking the entrance. A wrought-iron gate leads to the sidewalk. She pauses on the stoop, inhaling the cool Bogota morning air. The neighborhood is waking — a neighbor sweeps her sidewalk, a car starts down the street, birds chirp in the trees.

### Scene 088: Walking Through Front Gate
**Time:** 7:48 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Front gate, exterior
**Description:** Catalina pushes open the wrought-iron front gate, which creaks slightly on its hinges. The gate has a simple latch that she closes behind her.

### Scene 089: Walking Down Residential Street
**Time:** 7:49 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Residential street, Bogota
**Description:** Catalina walks down a typical Bogota residential street. The street is lined with multi-story houses with terracotta roofs, security bars on windows (rejas), and small front gardens with tropical plants. Some houses are painted in bright colors — yellow, orange, light blue, salmon pink. The Andes mountains are visible in the distance, green slopes partially wreathed in morning clouds. Other people walk by — a woman carrying a shopping bag, a man in work clothes hurrying, children in school uniforms with their parents. Morning sun casts long shadows across the sidewalk. A street dog trots along the gutter.

### Scene 090: Passing Street Vendor
**Time:** 7:52 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Street corner
**Description:** Catalina passes a small street vendor's cart at the corner. The vendor (an older man in an apron) sells tinto (small cups of black coffee) and empanadas from a glass-fronted warming case. A handwritten sign reads "Tinto $1,500 — Empanadas $2,000" in Colombian pesos. The smell of fried dough and coffee fills the air. Other pedestrians stop to buy.

### Scene 091: Approaching TransMilenio Station
**Time:** 7:55 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Street approaching station
**Description:** Catalina approaches a TransMilenio station (Bogota's rapid transit system). The distinctive red enclosed station structure sits in the center median of a wide avenue, elevated on a platform. Signs in Spanish read "TransMilenio" with the system logo and the station name. Other commuters walk toward the pedestrian bridge entrance — university students with backpacks, office workers in business clothes, people carrying bags. The sidewalk is busy with morning rush hour foot traffic. Cars and taxis fill the lanes on either side of the station.

### Scene 092: Climbing Pedestrian Bridge
**Time:** 7:56 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Pedestrian bridge stairs
**Description:** Catalina climbs the concrete stairs of the pedestrian bridge that leads over the road to the TransMilenio station entrance. Her hand rests on the metal railing. Other commuters climb alongside her, some faster, some slower. Her mochila bounces slightly on her back with each step. The bridge spans the wide avenue below, where cars and buses stream past. Advertisements in Spanish line the bridge walls — billboards for Colombian phone carriers, universities, and consumer products.

### Scene 093: Entering Station — Scanning Transit Card
**Time:** 7:58 AM — bright station light
**Setting:** TransMilenio station entrance
**Description:** Catalina holds her transit card (tarjeta TuLlave — a red and white plastic card) against the electronic reader at the turnstile. The reader beeps and the small screen flashes green, displaying "Buen Viaje" (good trip) and her remaining balance in pesos. She pushes through the chrome turnstile arm. The station entrance is crowded with morning commuters funneling through multiple turnstiles. Red and yellow TransMilenio branding covers the walls. Signs in Spanish indicate platforms and routes ("Rutas," "Salidas," "Informacion").

### Scene 094: Walking Along Platform
**Time:** 7:59 AM — bright platform light
**Setting:** TransMilenio platform, interior
**Description:** Catalina walks along the enclosed platform toward her bus stop position. The platform is a long, covered corridor with glass walls on both sides, allowing views of the avenue. Yellow safety lines mark the floor near the platform edges. Digital screens mounted overhead display route information in Spanish ("Proxima llegada: B13 — 2 min"). Dozens of commuters stand waiting — students with backpacks, professionals with briefcases, mothers with children. The platform hums with conversation and the distant rumble of approaching buses.

### Scene 095: Waiting on Platform
**Time:** 8:00 AM — bright platform light
**Setting:** TransMilenio platform
**Description:** Catalina stands on the platform, waiting for her bus, earbuds now in her ears. She scrolls through her phone — Spotify is open, playing a reggaeton playlist. The platform is crowded with commuters pressed together during rush hour. The yellow safety lines are barely visible beneath people's feet. Through the glass walls, the city of Bogota spreads out — high-rise buildings downtown, the mountains beyond, heavy traffic on the avenue. Red articulated buses arrive and depart at neighboring platforms with pneumatic hisses.

### Scene 096: Bus Arriving
**Time:** 8:04 AM — bright platform light
**Setting:** Platform, bus approaching
**Description:** A large red articulated TransMilenio bus pulls up to the platform, its automatic doors aligning with the platform openings. The bus displays the route number "B13" and "Portal Norte" on the front digital sign in orange LED letters. Air brakes hiss as it stops. Commuters surge forward, gathering near the doors.

### Scene 097: Boarding Bus
**Time:** 8:05 AM — crowded bus entrance
**Setting:** Boarding TransMilenio bus
**Description:** Catalina steps onto the crowded TransMilenio bus, following the stream of passengers. The interior shows red and yellow molded plastic seats (almost all occupied), metal grab poles running floor to ceiling, and hanging straps for standing passengers. The bus is packed — rush hour means bodies pressed close together. Digital route maps above the doors display the stops in Spanish. Catalina squeezes toward the middle of the bus, her mochila pressed against her chest (held in front to save space, common practice). The doors close behind her with a hiss.

### Scene 098: Standing in Crowded Bus — Gripping Pole
**Time:** 8:07 AM — moving bus, bright windows
**Setting:** Inside TransMilenio bus
**Description:** Catalina stands in the crowded bus, one hand gripping a vertical metal pole for balance, the other holding her mochila against her chest. The bus lurches forward, causing passengers to sway. She wears her earbuds, music providing a private soundtrack. Around her, other commuters stand packed together — a man in a suit reads something on his phone, a student holds a textbook, an elderly woman sits in a priority seat. Through the large windows, Bogota streets pass by — buildings, shops with Spanish signs ("Farmacia," "Panaderia"), street vendors, heavy traffic.

### Scene 099: Checking Phone on Bus
**Time:** 8:15 AM — moving bus
**Setting:** Inside bus, close-up
**Description:** Catalina manages to check her phone one-handed while standing on the moving bus, the other hand still on the pole. The screen shows a WhatsApp group chat called "Almuerzo hoy?" with friends discussing where to eat lunch. Her thumb types a quick reply: "En la cafeteria?" Morning light from the windows illuminates her face as the bus moves through the city. Other passengers around her also stare at their phones, the blue glow of screens dotting the crowded interior.

**Setting:** Inside bus, view of display
**Description:** The digital screen inside the bus displays "Proxima Parada: Universidad Nacional" (Next Stop: National University). The bus begins to slow. Catalina and several other students prepare to exit, shifting toward the doors. She puts her phone in her hoodie pocket, removes her earbuds, and swings her mochila onto one shoulder. Through the windows, the university campus is visible — green spaces, modern buildings, students walking along paths. The bus decelerates with a gentle brake whine.

### Scene 101: Exiting Bus
**Time:** 8:25 AM — bright platform light
**Setting:** Bus exit to platform
**Description:** Catalina steps off the TransMilenio bus onto the platform, joining a stream of other university students. The bus doors are wide open, students flowing out in a steady line. The platform is busy with students all heading toward the exit. She adjusts her mochila onto both shoulders and takes a deep breath of the fresh(er) platform air after the crowded bus. The red bus pulls away behind her, doors closing. Digital screens show the next arrival times.

### Scene 102: Descending Station Stairs
**Time:** 8:27 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Station exit stairs
**Description:** Catalina descends the concrete stairs from the TransMilenio station platform down toward street level. Her hand trails along the metal railing. Other students surround her, all heading in the same direction. Her mochila bounces on her back with each step.

The morning sun is bright and warm now, the earlier coolness of dawn gone.

### Scene 103: Walking to Campus Entrance
**Time:** 8:30 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Street near university
**Description:** Catalina walks from the TransMilenio station toward the Universidad Nacional de Colombia campus entrance.

Street vendors line the sidewalk selling coffee, empanadas, arepas, fruit cups, and photocopied study materials. A man sells minutes for cell phones from a small table. The university gate is visible ahead — a large arched entrance with the UNAL crest and "Universidad Nacional de Colombia" spelled out in metal letters. Large trees provide shade over the wide sidewalk. Catalina checks the time on her phone — 8:30, right on schedule.

**Description:** Catalina listens intently to the professor's response, nodding slowly. Her pen hovers over her notebook, ready to jot down the answer. The professor stands at the front, one hand gesturing toward the projected diagram, the other holding a laser pointer that creates a small red dot on the screen. Other students also listen, some taking notes. Catalina's expression is one of focused comprehension — slightly furrowed brow, eyes tracking the professor's gestures.

### Scene 119: Writing Down Answer
**Time:** 9:22 AM — bright classroom
**Setting:** At desk, close-up
**Description:** Catalina writes quickly in her notebook, capturing the professor's explanation. She writes a small star in the margin to mark this as important. Her handwriting is slightly faster and less neat than before, trying to keep pace with the spoken explanation. The pen moves rapidly. A small arrow connects this note to her earlier question. The page is filling up with detailed notes, highlighted sections, and marginal annotations.

### Scene 120: Small Group Discussion
**Time:** 9:45 AM — bright classroom
**Setting:** In classroom, desks rearranged
**Description:** The class has broken into small discussion groups of four. Catalina sits facing Laura and two other students (one male student with glasses and a flannel shirt, one female student with curly hair and a yellow sweater), all leaning toward each other over their desks. They discuss a concept animatedly in Spanish, gesturing and pointing to their notes. Notebooks are open between them, one student taps something in the textbook. Other groups around the classroom engage in similar animated discussions. The professor circulates, leaning in to listen to various groups and offering guidance.

### Scene 121: Taking Notes During Discussion
**Time:** 9:50 AM — bright classroom
**Setting:** At desk, during group work
**Description:** Catalina jots quick notes from the group discussion in her notebook, capturing ideas her classmates have shared.

**Time:** 10:00 AM — bright classroom
**Setting:** Front of classroom
**Description:** The professor calls the class back to attention, standing at the front beside a new slide titled "Estrategias de Aprendizaje Efectivas." Students swivel back to face forward, discussion groups dissolving. Catalina turns in her chair, pen ready, fresh page open. The room settles into lecture mode again — the hum of discussion replaced by the professor's clear voice and the scratch of pens on paper. Sunlight from the windows has shifted, now casting longer rectangles across the far wall.

### Scene 123: Checking Time — Class Ending
**Time:** 10:15 AM — bright classroom
**Setting:** At desk
**Description:** Catalina glances at her phone to check the time — "10:15 AM" displays on the screen. The professor is wrapping up the lecture, summarizing key points on a final slide. Students begin the subtle movements of preparing to leave — shifting in seats, capping pens, reaching for backpacks. Catalina starts closing her notebook, pressing the pages flat. Around her, the quiet rustling of materials being packed signals the end of the first class of the day.

### Scene 124: Packing Up After Class
**Time:** 10:17 AM — bright classroom

**Time:** 10:22 AM — sunny mid-morning
**Setting:** Campus walkway
**Description:** Catalina walks across the campus with Laura and another friend (a male classmate, Carlos, tall with short curly hair, wearing a graphic t-shirt and cargo pants). The sun is higher now, the morning coolness replaced by pleasant warmth. Students fill the walkways — some lounging on grass under trees, others hurrying between buildings. A food cart sells tinto and empanadas, a small line forming. Catalina's group walks toward the library building, discussing an assignment due next week. Her mochila bounces on her back.

### Scene 127: Buying Coffee from Campus Vendor
**Time:** 10:25 AM — sunny campus
**Setting:** Campus food cart
**Description:** Catalina approaches a small food cart (carrito) parked under a tree. The vendor (an older woman with a warm smile) operates a large thermos of coffee and has a glass case displaying empanadas, buñuelos (fried cheese balls), and pandebono (cheese bread). A hand-written cardboard sign lists prices in Spanish: "Tinto - $2,000 COP," "Empanada - $3,000 COP," "Buñuelo - $2,500 COP." Catalina hands over a wrinkled 2,000-peso bill and receives a small cup of hot black coffee (tinto). Steam rises from the small white styrofoam cup.

### Scene 128: Sipping Coffee While Walking
**Time:** 10:27 AM — sunny campus
**Setting:** Walking on campus path
**Description:** Catalina walks with Laura, sipping the hot tinto from the small styrofoam cup. The bitter, strong Colombian coffee warms her throat. She carries her mochila on one shoulder, the coffee in her other hand. Laura holds a buñuelo, tearing off golden-brown pieces and eating them. They walk toward the library building visible ahead — a modern multi-story structure with large glass windows reflecting the trees. Campus life buzzes around them — a student plays guitar under a tree, groups study on blankets on the grass, a political flyer is being distributed.

### Scene 129: Entering Library
**Time:** 10:32 AM — building interior
**Setting:** Library entrance
**Description:** Catalina enters the university library (Biblioteca Central). The entrance has a security checkpoint where a guard checks student IDs. She holds up her student ID card (carnet estudiantil) — a laminated card with her photo, name "Catalina Ramirez," student number, and UNAL logo. The guard nods her through. Inside, the library is modern and spacious with multiple visible floors connected by stairs and an elevator. Signs in Spanish direct to different sections: "Libros," "Computadores," "Zona de Estudio Silenciosa," "Hemeroteca." Students work at tables, browse tall bookshelves, and use desktop computers.

### Scene 130: Disposing of Coffee Cup
**Time:** 10:33 AM — library entrance area
**Setting:** Library lobby
**Description:** Catalina drops her empty styrofoam coffee cup into a recycling bin near the library entrance (marked "Reciclable" with a green arrow symbol).

She has a yellow highlighter in her other hand, occasionally marking important passages. Her expression is concentrated, brow slightly furrowed. The library's quiet atmosphere supports deep focus.

### Scene 135: Taking Notes on Laptop
**Time:** 11:00 AM — library
**Setting:** At study table
**Description:** Catalina types notes on her laptop, her fingers moving quickly across the keyboard. The screen shows a Word document with her notes in Spanish, formatted with bold headers, bullet points, and indented sub-points. The document title reads "Resumen — Capitulo 8: Teorias del Aprendizaje." Her textbook is propped open beside the laptop, a pen serving as a bookmark between pages. Natural light from the window illuminates the workspace, the campus visible through the glass — students walking, trees swaying in a light breeze.

### Scene 136: Stretching at Desk
**Time:** 11:15 AM — library
**Setting:** At study table
**Description:** Catalina leans back in her chair, arms raised above her head in a seated stretch, eyes closed briefly. Her back arches slightly, fingers interlaced. She has been studying for nearly an hour straight. Laura glances over and smiles. The laptop screen shows the Word document, cursor blinking at the bottom of a long page of notes. The textbook lies flat, pages spread open. She exhales, rolls her neck, then leans forward again to continue working.

### Scene 137: Group Study Discussion
**Time:** 11:30 AM — library
**Setting:** Study table, wider view
**Description:** Catalina, Laura, and two additional classmates (Carlos from earlier, and Sofia, a petite woman with glasses and her hair in two braids) lean together over their notebooks and laptops, discussing in hushed whispers (library etiquette). Carlos points to a graph in his textbook, Sofia shows a diagram on her laptop screen. They whisper and gesture, working through a complex concept about learning theories. Notebooks with Spanish notes are spread across the table. The collaborative session shows engaged academic teamwork — heads close together, fingers pointing at text.

### Scene 138: Checking Phone — Lunch Message
**Time:** 11:55 AM — library
**Setting:** At study table
**Description:** Catalina picks up her phone from the desk. The screen shows "11:55 AM" and several WhatsApp notifications. A group chat called "Almuerzo hoy" shows messages from friends about meeting at the cafeteria at noon. She types a quick reply: "Ya vamos!" (We're coming!). She looks up at Laura and the study group, raising her eyebrows — the universal signal for "should we go?" Laura nods, already starting to close her laptop. The study session has reached its natural break point.

### Scene 139: Packing Up in Library
**Time:** 11:58 AM — library
**Setting:** At study table
**Description:** Catalina closes her laptop and slides it into the padded sleeve, then into her mochila. She stacks the textbook on the notebook, tucks the pencil case on top, and fits everything into the backpack compartments. She unplugs the charger, winds the cord, and stuffs it in a side pocket. Laura and the others do the same. The empty table shows the outlines of where materials sat — slightly cleaner rectangles on the dusty wood. She zips the mochila, swings it onto her shoulders, and pushes her chair in quietly.

### Scene 141: Walking to Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:03 PM — sunny campus
**Setting:** Campus walkway toward cafeteria
**Description:** Catalina, Laura, Carlos, and Sofia walk in a group toward the main university cafeteria building. The path is crowded with lunch-hour traffic — a slow-moving river of students. Food vendors line the walkway in a row of carts selling empanadas, arepas with cheese, fresh fruit cups (mango, papaya, pineapple), and aguapanela (sugarcane water). Some students eat while walking. The cafeteria building ahead is a large concrete structure with glass doors and a sign reading "Cafeteria Central — UNAL."

### Scene 142: Entering Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:06 PM — bright interior
**Setting:** Cafeteria entrance
**Description:** Catalina and her friends push through the glass doors into the busy university cafeteria. The space is large, high-ceilinged, and noisy, filled with dozens of tables of eating students. Multiple food service stations line the walls — one serving almuerzos corrientes (set lunches), another with a la carte options (sandwiches, salads), a third with beverages and desserts. Long communal tables with attached bench seats fill the center of the room. Overhead fluorescent lights supplement the natural light from high windows. The din of conversation in Spanish fills the air, mixed with the clatter of trays and utensils.

### Scene 143: Joining Food Line
**Time:** 12:08 PM — bright cafeteria
**Setting:** Food service line
**Description:** Catalina picks up a plastic tray from a stack at the end of the service line and joins the queue at the almuerzo corriente station. The line moves slowly, about a dozen students ahead of her. Laura stands right behind her. Ahead, cafeteria workers in white hairnets and blue aprons serve food from large metal trays behind a glass sneeze guard. A whiteboard menu displays today's options in blue marker: "Almuerzo del dia: Arroz con pollo, ensalada, sopa de lentejas, jugo de mora — $8,000 COP."

### Scene 144: Moving Through Line
**Time:** 12:10 PM — bright cafeteria
**Setting:** Food service line, closer to front
**Description:** Catalina inches forward in line, tray in hand. She can now see the food options clearly behind the glass — large metal hotel pans of white rice, shredded chicken in a tomato-based sauce, lentil soup in a deep pot, a mixed green salad with tomato and shredded carrot, and fried plantain slices (patacones) stacked golden-brown. A separate station has drinks — large jugs of fruit juice in deep purple (mora/blackberry), bright orange (mango), and pale green (lulo). The smells of cooked food intensify.

### Scene 145: Receiving Lunch
**Time:** 12:12 PM — bright cafeteria
**Setting:** Food service counter
**Description:** A cafeteria worker (a heavyset woman with a warm smile under her hairnet) serves Catalina's lunch onto sectioned trays. She ladles lentil soup into a small bowl, spoons a mound of white rice into one section, adds shredded chicken with sauce in another, places a serving of salad alongside, and sets two golden patacones on the side. Another worker fills a plastic cup with dark purple mora juice from a large jug. Catalina says "Gracias, senora" and moves her loaded tray forward toward the cashier.

### Scene 146: Paying for Lunch
**Time:** 12:14 PM — cafeteria cashier
**Setting:** Cashier station
**Description:** Catalina stands at the cashier, her full tray on the counter. She pulls her small brown leather wallet from her hoodie pocket and hands over a 10,000-peso bill to the cashier (an older woman with reading glasses). The register displays "$8,000" in green LED numbers. The cashier makes change — a 2,000-peso bill. Catalina tucks the change and receipt into her wallet. Laura pays behind her. The cashier line moves efficiently, students filing through.

### Scene 147: Searching for Table
**Time:** 12:16 PM — busy cafeteria
**Setting:** Dining area
**Description:** Catalina and her friends navigate through the crowded cafeteria, carrying their loaded trays carefully above the seated students. Most tables are full — groups of students eat, talk, laugh. They spot a partially empty table near a window and head toward it, weaving between chairs and backpacks on the floor. The noise level is high — Spanish conversations layered over each other, trays clattering, chairs scraping on tile. Catalina's tray is balanced expertly as she maneuvers.

### Scene 148: Sitting Down at Table
**Time:** 12:17 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At dining table
**Description:** The four friends settle at the communal table with attached bench seats. They set their trays down in a row — all have similar almuerzos corrientes with slight variations. Catalina sits next to Laura, across from Carlos and Sofia. Mochilas go on the floor under the table. Napkins are unfolded from the tray, utensils unwrapped from their paper bundle. The window beside them shows the campus outside — students walking, trees, sunshine. The table surface is clean melamine, slightly sticky from the last wipe-down.

### Scene 149: Eating Soup First
**Time:** 12:18 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina lifts a spoonful of lentil soup (sopa de lentejas) to her lips, blowing gently to cool it. The soup is thick and brown with visible lentils, diced carrot, and potato pieces. Steam rises from the small bowl. She sips carefully — the warm, savory broth is comforting. Her tray shows the untouched main course waiting beside the soup bowl. The plastic cup of mora juice stands at the corner of the tray, its deep purple color vivid.

### Scene 150: Eating Main Course — Rice and Chicken
**Time:** 12:22 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina scoops a forkful of white rice and shredded chicken together, the tomato sauce coating the rice grains orange. She brings it to her mouth. The chicken is tender, the sauce slightly spicy. Her plate shows the organized sections — rice mound diminishing, chicken pile smaller, salad still mostly untouched, the two golden patacones waiting. She chews, enjoying the familiar cafeteria food. The empty soup bowl sits pushed aside.

### Scene 151: Friends Talking and Laughing
**Time:** 12:28 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At table, group view
**Description:** The four friends eat and talk animatedly in Spanish. Carlos tells a story, gesturing dramatically with his fork, making everyone laugh. Catalina covers her mouth mid-chew, eyes crinkling with amusement. Laura nearly chokes on her juice from laughing. Sofia shakes her head, grinning. Trays are half-eaten. This is the social heart of the university day — friends connecting, decompressing, and sharing stories over lunch. The bustling cafeteria provides a lively backdrop.

### Scene 152: Eating Patacon
**Time:** 12:32 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina picks up a golden patacon (fried green plantain, flattened and re-fried until crispy) with her fingers and bites into it. The exterior crunches, the interior is soft and starchy. A few crumbs fall to the tray. She dips the remaining piece into a small cup of pink salsa rosada (mayo-ketchup mix) that she got from a condiment station. The crispy plantain is a favorite part of the almuerzo. Her mora juice is half-finished beside her plate.

### Scene 153: Drinking Mora Juice
**Time:** 12:35 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At table
**Description:** Catalina lifts the plastic cup of mora juice to her lips and drinks. The cold, sweet-tart blackberry juice refreshes her. The juice is thick and deep purple, almost opaque, natural fruit pulp visible. She sets the cup down, a faint purple ring on her upper lip that she wipes with her napkin. Her tray is mostly empty now — just a few grains of rice, a lettuce leaf, and crumbs from the patacones.

### Scene 154: Finishing Meal
**Time:** 12:40 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** At table
**Description:** Catalina scrapes the last bits of rice from her tray with her fork, chasing a few grains. Her tray is essentially clean — soup bowl empty, main sections scraped, patacones gone, salad eaten, juice cup drained. She sets her fork down on the tray with a satisfied expression. Used napkins are crumpled beside the tray. Her friends are at similar stages of finishing, the conversation winding down naturally.

### Scene 155: Clearing Tray
**Time:** 12:45 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Tray return area
**Description:** Catalina carries her tray to the designated return area near the cafeteria exit. She scrapes leftover scraps into a large compost bin, then separates the plastic cup and utensils into a recycling bin. The empty tray goes onto a tall stack. A laminated sign in Spanish reads "Deposite su bandeja aqui — Gracias" (Deposit your tray here — Thank you) with arrows pointing to each bin. Other students cycle through the same routine beside her. Cafeteria workers begin collecting the stacked trays.

### Scene 156: Exiting Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:48 PM — bright midday sun
**Setting:** Cafeteria exit to campus
**Description:** Catalina and her three friends exit the cafeteria through the glass doors into the bright afternoon sun. The campus is still bustling with post-lunch activity. They walk together, lighter now without the urgency of hunger. Laura suggests buying coffee before afternoon class. Catalina agrees. The group turns toward a small campus cafe visible across a tree-lined courtyard. Their mochilas bounce on their backs as they walk, the midday sun casting short shadows at their feet.

### Scene 157: Buying Afternoon Coffee
**Time:** 12:52 PM — sunny campus
**Setting:** Small campus cafe kiosk
**Description:** Catalina stands at a small campus cafe kiosk — a simple structure with a counter, an espresso machine, and a display of pastries and snacks. The barista (a young man, fellow student working part-time) takes her order. A chalkboard menu lists prices: "Cafe con leche $3,500 — Tinto $2,000 — Capuccino $4,000." She orders a cafe con leche. The barista steams milk with a loud hiss, pours espresso, and hands her a paper cup. She pays with coins from her wallet — several hundred-peso coins clinking on the counter.

### Scene 158: Walking with Coffee Before Afternoon Class
**Time:** 12:55 PM — sunny campus
**Setting:** Campus walkway
**Description:** Catalina walks with Laura across the campus, sipping her cafe con leche from the paper cup. The warm, sweet coffee is a mid-day boost. They walk slowly, no rush — the afternoon class starts at 1:00 PM and the building is close. The campus is beautiful in the midday light — every leaf on every tree sharply defined, long shadows gone, the sky intensely blue above the Andes peaks in the distance. Other students move in all directions, some resting on grass, others heading to class.

Catalina stretches her arms overhead, stiff from sitting at the computer. She suggests they go to the campus cafe to study and relax before heading home.

### Scene 186: Walking to Campus Cafe
**Time:** 3:35 PM — warm golden afternoon
**Setting:** Campus walkway
**Description:** Catalina and Laura walk along a tree-lined path toward a small campus cafe called "Cafe de Letras" — a popular student hangout near the Humanities building. The path is dappled with afternoon sun filtering through eucalyptus branches. Fallen leaves crunch underfoot. A squirrel runs across the path ahead of them. Students sit on benches, some reading, others talking in pairs. The mountains in the background are lit golden by the afternoon sun, the morning mist long gone.

### Scene 187: Entering Campus Cafe
**Time:** 3:38 PM — warm interior
**Setting:** Campus cafe interior
**Description:** Catalina and Laura push through the glass door of Cafe de Letras, a cozy space with exposed brick walls, mismatched wooden tables and chairs, string lights, and bookshelves lining the walls (filled with donated novels and textbooks). The cafe is half-full — students sit with laptops, books, and coffee cups. Soft acoustic music plays from a small speaker. A chalkboard menu behind the counter lists Colombian coffee drinks and snacks: "Capuccino $4,500 — Chocolate caliente $4,000 — Pan de bono $2,500 — Empanada $3,000." The barista (a young woman with an apron over a band t-shirt) looks up as they enter.

### Scene 188: Ordering at Counter
**Time:** 3:40 PM — cafe interior
**Setting:** Cafe counter
**Description:** Catalina stands at the wooden counter, scanning the chalkboard menu. She orders a chocolate caliente (hot chocolate — a classic Colombian afternoon drink) and a pan de bono (cheese bread, a small golden ball of warm, chewy bread made with yuca flour and queso). The barista writes the order on a slip. Catalina pulls pesos from her wallet — a 5,000-peso bill. Laura orders a capuccino behind her. The glass pastry case shows rows of pan de bono, buñuelos, almojabanas, and empanadas.

### Scene 189: Receiving Chocolate Caliente
**Time:** 3:43 PM — cafe interior
**Setting:** Cafe counter
**Description:** The barista slides a large ceramic mug of chocolate caliente across the counter to Catalina. The hot chocolate is thick and dark, Colombian style — made with real chocolate tablets (chocolate Luker brand), milk, and a hint of cinnamon. Steam rises in fragrant curls. A small plate with a golden pan de bono sits beside it. Catalina wraps her hands around the warm mug, feeling the heat through the ceramic. She inhales the rich chocolate aroma. Laura receives her capuccino in a similar mug.

### Scene 190: Finding Table in Cafe
**Time:** 3:44 PM — cafe interior, warm lighting
**Setting:** Cafe seating area
**Description:** Catalina carries her mug and plate to a small wooden table by the window. The table has a small succulent plant in a ceramic pot and a folded cafe menu. She sets down her mug carefully, the chocolate caliente sloshing slightly. Laura sits across from her. Through the window, the campus is bathed in late afternoon light — students walking, trees swaying, the mountains golden in the distance. Catalina pulls her chair closer and sets her mochila on an empty chair beside her.

### Scene 191: Sipping Chocolate Caliente
**Time:** 3:45 PM — cafe, warm lighting
**Setting:** At cafe table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina raises the ceramic mug to her lips and sips the hot chocolate. The thick, creamy liquid is sweet and warm, with a faint cinnamon note. She closes her eyes briefly in satisfaction — chocolate caliente is a comforting Colombian afternoon tradition. A thin chocolate mustache forms on her upper lip, which she licks away. The steam from the mug catches the golden afternoon light from the window. The pan de bono sits untouched on the plate, golden and round.

### Scene 192: Eating Pan de Bono
**Time:** 3:47 PM — cafe
**Setting:** At cafe table
**Description:** Catalina tears into the pan de bono, pulling the warm cheese bread apart. The interior is soft, stretchy, and slightly cheesy — yuca flour and queso create a unique texture. She pops a piece into her mouth. The exterior is lightly crispy, the inside warm and doughy. Crumbs fall onto the small plate. Laura dunks a piece of her own pan de bono into her capuccino. They talk between bites about the research project and their plans for the evening.

### Scene 193: Opening Laptop at Cafe
**Time:** 3:50 PM — cafe, warm lighting
**Setting:** At cafe table
**Description:** Catalina opens her laptop on the small cafe table, the sticker-covered lid folding back. The screen wakes to her desktop. She plugs in her USB drive and opens one of the research papers she downloaded earlier — a PDF displayed in the browser, dense academic text in Spanish about stress and sleep patterns. The chocolate caliente mug sits beside the laptop, steam still rising. The cafe's warm ambient light combines with the laptop's screen glow. She settles in for some light study before heading home.

### Scene 194: Reading Research Paper
**Time:** 3:55 PM — cafe
**Setting:** At cafe table, close-up on screen
**Description:** Catalina reads the research paper on her laptop screen, her eyes moving across lines of academic Spanish. She uses the laptop trackpad to scroll slowly. A key section is visible: "Resultados: Los estudiantes con niveles altos de estres reportaron menor calidad de sueno (p < 0.05)." She reaches for her notebook and jots a quick summary note. The chocolate caliente mug is half-empty beside her. Laura reads on her own laptop across the table, occasionally sharing an interesting finding.

### Scene 195: Taking Notes on Paper
**Time:** 4:05 PM — cafe, golden afternoon light
**Setting:** At cafe table
**Description:** Catalina writes notes in her notebook from the research paper, creating a structured summary: "Articulo: Rodriguez et al., 2024," "Muestra: 350 estudiantes," "Instrumento: Escala de Estres Percibido," "Hallazgo principal: correlacion negativa entre estres y calidad de sueno." Her handwriting is neat and organized. The laptop displays the PDF beside her. Afternoon sun pours through the window, creating a warm golden glow on the notebook page. The chocolate caliente mug is nearly empty, a ring of dried chocolate inside.

### Scene 196: WhatsApp Call with Friend
**Time:** 4:15 PM — cafe
**Setting:** At cafe table, phone in hand
**Description:** Catalina's phone vibrates on the table — an incoming WhatsApp voice call from her friend Mariana (whose contact photo shows a girl with red-streaked hair). Catalina picks up, holding the phone to her ear. She speaks softly (cafe etiquette) in rapid Spanish, laughing. Mariana is inviting her to a movie this weekend. Catalina glances at Laura, mouths "Mariana" with an eye-roll and a grin. The conversation is brief — she agrees to the movie and hangs up, setting the phone back down.

### Scene 197: Checking Time — Deciding to Leave
**Time:** 4:35 PM — cafe, late afternoon light
**Setting:** At cafe table
**Description:** Catalina checks her phone — "4:35 PM." The afternoon has flown by. She mentions to Laura that she should start heading to the TransMilenio station to avoid the worst of rush hour. Laura agrees — she also needs to get home. Catalina saves her work, closes the research paper PDF, and ejects her USB drive. She begins closing her laptop and packing her materials back into the mochila. The cafe has filled with more students in the late afternoon, the atmosphere warm and social.

### Scene 198: Paying at Cafe Counter
**Time:** 4:38 PM — cafe interior
**Setting:** Cafe counter
**Description:** Catalina brings her empty mug and plate to the counter, thanking the barista. She realizes she already paid when ordering. She returns to the table, double-checks she has everything — notebook, laptop, pencil case, USB drive, phone, wallet — and zips the mochila closed. Laura finishes her capuccino in a final gulp and stands. They push in their chairs and wave goodbye to the barista.

### Scene 199: Leaving Campus
**Time:** 4:42 PM — golden late afternoon
**Setting:** Campus exit path
**Description:** Catalina and Laura walk toward the university campus exit. The late afternoon sun bathes everything in warm golden light. Long shadows stretch across the green lawns. The campus is quieter now — most afternoon classes are over, students heading home. A few joggers run along the perimeter path. The Andes mountains glow orange-pink in the distance as the sun descends. Catalina and Laura say goodbye near the gate — Laura lives in a different direction and takes a different bus. They hug, promise to text later, and part ways.

### Scene 200: Walking to TransMilenio Station
**Time:** 4:48 PM — golden late afternoon
**Setting:** Street outside university
**Description:** Catalina walks alone toward the TransMilenio station, retracing her morning path. The street is busier now — end-of-day traffic builds, cars honking, motorcycles weaving. Street vendors have shifted their offerings to afternoon items — arepas rellenas (stuffed corn cakes), fruit juices in plastic bags, chicharron (fried pork rinds). The smell of fried food fills the air. Catalina walks briskly, earbuds in, music playing, mochila bouncing. The pedestrian bridge to the station is visible ahead, silhouetted against the golden sky.

---

## PART 10: COMMUTE HOME (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

### Scene 201: Climbing Pedestrian Bridge to Station
**Time:** 5:00 PM — golden late afternoon
**Setting:** Pedestrian bridge stairs
**Description:** Catalina climbs the concrete stairs of the pedestrian bridge leading to the TransMilenio station. The stairs are more crowded than morning — rush hour in reverse, with office workers and students all heading home simultaneously. Her hand grips the metal railing as she ascends. Other commuters press close on the narrow stairway. The bridge offers a view of the busy avenue below — six lanes of cars, buses, and motorcycles in slow-moving traffic. The golden afternoon light bathes everything in warm tones.

### Scene 202: Scanning Transit Card at Turnstile
**Time:** 5:03 PM — bright station interior
**Setting:** TransMilenio station entrance
**Description:** Catalina holds her TuLlave transit card against the electronic reader. The small screen flashes green: "Buen Viaje" and displays her remaining balance — "Saldo: $15,400 COP." She pushes through the chrome turnstile. The station entrance is packed — a thick crowd of commuters funneling through the turnstile gates. The beeping of card readers creates a rapid rhythmic sound. Catalina joins the flow, moving toward the platform.

### Scene 203: Crowded Platform — Rush Hour
**Time:** 5:05 PM — bright platform
**Setting:** TransMilenio platform
**Description:** The platform is significantly more crowded than morning — rush hour means bodies packed nearly shoulder to shoulder. Catalina stands in the mass of commuters, her mochila held against her chest (protective posture in crowds). The yellow safety lines on the floor are invisible under the sea of feet. Digital screens show wait times — "B13: 6 min" — and the crowd groans collectively. Everyone is tired, staring at phones, looking impatient. The air is warm and stuffy inside the enclosed platform. Catalina exhales, settling in to wait.

### Scene 204: Bus Arriving — Doors Opening
**Time:** 5:12 PM — bright platform
**Setting:** Platform edge
**Description:** The red articulated TransMilenio bus marked "B13 — Portal Norte" pulls up to the platform with a squeal of brakes and a hiss of air doors. The doors slide open and a wave of exiting passengers pushes out while the waiting crowd surges forward. Catalina is swept along in the crush, mochila clutched to her chest, one hand reaching for something to hold. The boarding process is chaotic — bodies press in all directions. She manages to squeeze through the doors just before they begin their warning beeps.

### Scene 205: Packed Bus — Standing Room Only
**Time:** 5:14 PM — crowded bus interior
**Setting:** Inside TransMilenio bus
**Description:** Catalina stands pressed between other commuters in the extremely crowded bus. Every seat is taken, every standing space filled. She holds a ceiling strap with one hand, her mochila crushed against her chest with the other. The bus lurches forward, and all standing passengers sway in unison. The air is warm and close, the smell of sweat and perfume mixed. Through the foggy windows, Bogota's rush-hour traffic crawls in the lanes beside the dedicated bus lane. Catalina stares out the window, earbuds in, music creating a private island of calm.

### Scene 206: Bus Stopping — Passengers Shuffling
**Time:** 5:20 PM — bus interior
**Setting:** Inside bus at a stop
**Description:** The bus stops at an intermediate station and the doors open. A few passengers exit, but more board, somehow compressing the crowd further. Catalina shuffles to one side to let people pass, her sneakers stepping on someone else's foot — she mouths "Perdon." A pregnant woman boards and a young man near Catalina stands to give her his seat. The pregnant woman smiles and sits, touching her belly. The doors close and the bus lurches forward again.

### Scene 207: Checking Phone — Message from Mama
**Time:** 5:28 PM — bus interior
**Setting:** Inside bus, close-up on phone
**Description:** Catalina manages to pull her phone from her hoodie pocket one-handed while gripping the strap. The screen shows a WhatsApp message from "Mama" with a heart emoji: "Mija, a que hora llegas? Estoy haciendo arroz con pollo" (Sweetie, what time do you arrive? I'm making arroz con pollo). Catalina types awkwardly with one thumb: "Como en 20 min" (About 20 min). She adds a heart emoji back. The phone screen is slightly cracked in one corner — student budget. The bus window behind her shows buildings passing.

### Scene 208: Bus Nearing Home Stop
**Time:** 5:40 PM — bus interior, dimming light
**Setting:** Inside bus, view of display
**Description:** The digital display shows the station name approaching Catalina's home stop. The crowd has thinned somewhat as passengers have exited at various stops. Catalina can see a seat now but does not take it — her stop is next. She pulls her earbuds out and winds them loosely, tucking them in her pocket. She swings her mochila onto one shoulder, preparing to exit. Through the window, her residential neighborhood is recognizable — the colorful houses, the corner tienda (small shop), the mountains glowing pink in the sunset.

### Scene 209: Exiting Bus
**Time:** 5:43 PM — platform, sunset light
**Setting:** Platform at home station
**Description:** Catalina steps off the bus onto the platform at her local station. The air is cooler than inside the bus — a relief. The late afternoon sun is low, casting long orange shadows. Fewer people exit here compared to the major stations. She takes a deep breath, rolling her shoulders to release the tension from standing for 40 minutes. The platform has a few advertisements in Spanish — a cell phone plan, a supermarket sale. She walks toward the exit stairs.

### Scene 210: Descending Station Stairs
**Time:** 5:45 PM — sunset light
**Setting:** Station exit stairs
**Description:** Catalina descends the concrete stairs from the platform to the pedestrian bridge, then down to street level. Her sneakers tap on each step. The metal railing is warm from the day's sun. At the bottom, the residential street stretches out — familiar houses, a corner bakery (panaderia) with its yellow awning, a tienda with Coca-Cola signage, and trees casting long evening shadows. A couple of other passengers descend behind her. The sunset paints the sky orange and pink above the mountains.

### Scene 211: Walking Through Neighborhood
**Time:** 5:48 PM — warm sunset light
**Setting:** Residential street
**Description:** Catalina walks through her neighborhood toward home. The residential street is quieter than the morning — some children play in a small park, a man walks a dog, a woman sweeps her front stoop. The houses are warm colors — yellow, peach, white — with security bars on windows catching the orange sunset light. Cooking smells drift from open windows — garlic, onion, frying plantains. A neighbor waves from a doorway — "Buenas tardes, Catalina!" She waves back, "Buenas tardes, Dona Carmen!"

### Scene 212: Passing Corner Tienda
**Time:** 5:52 PM — sunset light
**Setting:** Street corner
**Description:** Catalina passes the neighborhood tienda (corner shop) — a small storefront with metal grate doors, shelves visible inside stacked with Colombian products: bags of rice, cans of beans, Coca-Cola bottles, Colombiana soda, bags of Margarita potato chips, Noel cookies. An older man sits on a plastic chair outside, drinking a Pony Malta (Colombian malt beverage). A handwritten sign on cardboard announces "Aguacates frescos — $3,000." Catalina does not stop today but makes a mental note. The tienda's single fluorescent tube flickers to life as dusk approaches.

### Scene 213: Approaching Home
**Time:** 5:55 PM — fading sunset light
**Setting:** Residential street near home
**Description:** Catalina approaches her family's yellow house. The wrought-iron front gate is visible, the small garden with its tropical plants, the front stoop. A warm light glows from the kitchen window — mama is cooking. The clothesline in the side yard has been brought in for the evening. The front porch light (a simple bulb in a cage fixture) turns on as she approaches — papa or Daniel turned it on for her. She pulls out her house key from a small pocket in her mochila.

### Scene 214: Opening Front Gate
**Time:** 5:57 PM — dusk
**Setting:** Front of house
**Description:** Catalina pushes open the wrought-iron front gate, its familiar creak announcing her arrival. She walks up the short stone path through the front garden. A potted orchid on the stoop catches the last golden light. She reaches the heavy wooden front door with its decorative metalwork (reja) and inserts her key into the lock. The door opens to warmth, light, and the delicious smell of mama's cooking flooding outward. She steps inside, calling "Ya llegue!" (I'm home!).

### Scene 215: Entering House — Greeting Family
**Time:** 5:58 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Front entrance/hallway
**Description:** Catalina steps into the warm hallway, closing the front door behind her. She drops her mochila onto the small table by the door with a thud. Her mother's voice calls from the kitchen: "Hola mija, como te fue?" (Hi sweetie, how was your day?). Catalina kicks off her sneakers by the door — a row of family shoes lines the wall (papa's dress shoes, Daniel's school shoes, mama's house slippers). She walks toward the kitchen in her socked feet, the tile floor cool after a day in sneakers. Family photos on the walls catch the warm lamplight.

## PART 11: FAMILY DINNER (6:00 PM - 7:30 PM)

### Scene 216: Entering Kitchen — Greeting Mama
**Time:** 6:00 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, doorway
**Description:** Catalina walks into the kitchen and kisses her mother on the cheek. Mama stands at the gas stove, stirring a large aluminum pot with a wooden spoon. She wears her floral apron, hair loosely pulled back. The kitchen is warm and aromatic — garlic, onion, cilantro, and simmering chicken fill the air. On the counter, ingredients are spread: a bowl of washed rice, diced vegetables (carrots, peas, red bell pepper), and a bundle of fresh cilantro. A pot of white rice steams on a back burner. The gas flame flickers blue beneath the main pot. Mama smiles, "Lavate las manos y me ayudas" (Wash your hands and help me).

### Scene 217: Washing Hands at Kitchen Sink
**Time:** 6:01 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen sink
**Description:** Catalina stands at the kitchen sink, running water over her hands, lathering with dish soap. She scrubs between her fingers, washes her wrists. Through the window above the sink, the backyard is dim now — the clothesline barely visible, the last orange light of sunset on the mountains. She rinses, dries her hands on a kitchen towel hanging from a hook, and turns to her mother. "Que necesitas?" (What do you need?).

### Scene 218: Chopping Vegetables
**Time:** 6:03 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen counter
**Description:** Catalina stands at the wooden cutting board on the kitchen counter, chopping a ripe red tomato into small cubes with a large kitchen knife. The tomato splits open, revealing seeds and juice on the board. Beside her are already-chopped ingredients in small bowls: diced white onion, minced garlic, chopped green bell pepper. A bundle of fresh cilantro waits to be chopped. Her mother supervises from the stove, occasionally calling out instructions. The colorful backsplash tiles frame the scene. Catalina's gray hoodie sleeves are pushed up past her elbows.

### Scene 219: Chopping Cilantro
**Time:** 6:06 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen counter, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Catalina's hands chopping fresh cilantro on the wooden cutting board. The bright green herb releases its pungent aroma as the knife rocks through it rapidly. Small green flecks scatter. Her light pink nails contrast with the green leaves. A mound of finely chopped cilantro builds on the board. The knife is a large stainless-steel chef's knife with a black handle, well-used. Tomato juice stains the board from the previous chopping.

### Scene 220: Bringing Vegetables to Pot
**Time:** 6:08 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, stove area
**Description:** Catalina carries the cutting board loaded with chopped vegetables to the stove, carefully tipping the diced tomato and cilantro into the large pot her mother is tending. The vegetables slide off the board and splash into the simmering broth. Steam rises. Her mother stirs them in with the wooden spoon. The pot contains arroz con pollo in progress — chicken pieces visible in a golden broth with rice beginning to absorb the liquid. The gas flame is set to medium, flickering blue.

### Scene 221: Setting the Table
**Time:** 6:15 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Dining area
**Description:** Catalina sets the family dining table in the adjoining dining room (comedor). She places four colorful ceramic plates (each a slightly different hand-painted design — a Colombian artisan set) around the wooden table. Forks and knives go on folded paper napkins beside each plate. She sets out four glasses, a pitcher of fresh-made lemonade (limonada) with visible lemon slices and ice, and a basket for bread. A simple woven placemat sits under each setting. The overhead light casts warm illumination. Through the archway, the kitchen is visible with mama still cooking.

### Scene 222: Placing Glasses and Pitcher
**Time:** 6:17 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Dining table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina fills the four glasses with limonada from the glass pitcher, tilting it carefully so the pale yellow liquid pours without splashing. Ice cubes clink against the glass. A slice of lemon catches at the pitcher's lip. Each glass receives an equal portion. Condensation immediately forms on the outside of the glasses in the warm room. She places a glass beside each plate, then sets the pitcher in the center of the table on a cork coaster.

### Scene 223: Papa Arriving Home
**Time:** 6:20 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Front door/hallway
**Description:** The front door opens and Catalina's father enters, wearing his work clothes (button-down shirt slightly loosened at the collar, slacks, carrying a briefcase). He calls "Buenas noches, familia!" (Good evening, family!). Catalina comes from the dining room to greet him with a cheek kiss. He sets his briefcase down by the door, removes his dress shoes, and puts on house slippers. His tie is already removed, stuffed in his jacket pocket. He asks "Que huele tan rico?" (What smells so good?). From the kitchen, mama responds "Arroz con pollo!"

### Scene 224: Daniel at Table with Homework
**Time:** 6:22 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Dining table
**Description:** Daniel sits at one end of the dining table, school notebooks spread in front of him, working on homework. He wears a casual t-shirt now — having changed from his school uniform. His math textbook is open, and he scribbles calculations in a notebook. His phone sits face-down beside him (mama's rule — no phones during homework). Catalina walks past, glancing at his work. "Eso esta mal," (That's wrong) she teases, pointing at an equation. Daniel swats her hand away, "Metiche!" (Nosy!). Sibling banter.

### Scene 225: Mama Announcing Dinner
**Time:** 6:30 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen to dining room
**Description:** Mama comes to the kitchen doorway, untying her apron, and announces "Ya esta lista la comida!" (Dinner is ready!). She carries the large pot of arroz con pollo using oven mitts (bright red, well-worn) and sets it on a woven trivet in the center of the dining table. Steam billows from the pot as she lifts the lid — golden rice studded with chicken pieces, peas, carrots, red pepper, and cilantro. The aroma floods the room. Daniel quickly stacks his homework to one side. Papa emerges from the hallway, having changed into comfortable home clothes.

### Scene 226: Family Sitting Down to Dinner
**Time:** 6:32 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, full family
**Description:** The family of four takes their seats around the table. Papa sits at the head, mama opposite near the kitchen, Catalina and Daniel on the sides facing each other. The table is set with the colorful plates, glasses of limonada, napkins, and the steaming pot of arroz con pollo in the center. A small bowl of sliced avocado and a plate of warm arepas have been added. Papa bows his head briefly — a quick grace before eating, a family tradition. Everyone follows, a moment of stillness before the meal begins.

### Scene 227: Mama Serving Arroz con Pollo
**Time:** 6:33 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table
**Description:** Mama uses a large serving spoon to scoop arroz con pollo from the pot onto each family member's plate. The golden rice mound steams on the colorful ceramic plate, chicken pieces glistening. Peas and diced carrots are distributed throughout. She serves papa first, then Catalina, then Daniel, then herself — generous portions for everyone. Fresh cilantro garnishes the top. Catalina watches the food land on her plate with appreciation.

### Scene 228: Adding Avocado to Plate
**Time:** 6:35 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina reaches for the bowl of sliced avocado and places several creamy green slices alongside her arroz con pollo. The ripe avocado is soft, a rich green against the golden rice. She also takes a warm arepa from the bread plate and sets it on the edge of her plate. The arepa is simple — golden and round, no toppings yet. Her plate is now full and colorful: golden rice with chicken, green avocado, the golden arepa. She picks up her fork.

### Scene 229: First Bite of Dinner
**Time:** 6:36 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table
**Description:** Catalina takes her first forkful of arroz con pollo — rice, a piece of tender chicken, a few peas. She brings it to her mouth and chews. The flavors are familiar and comforting — mama's seasoning is always perfect, the chicken tender, the rice infused with chicken broth and spices. She closes her eyes briefly in appreciation. Her family is eating around her, the comfortable sounds of silverware on ceramic, glasses being lifted, quiet chewing.

### Scene 230: Family Dinner Conversation
**Time:** 6:40 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, full family view
**Description:** The family eats and talks together, sharing stories from their day. Papa describes a funny incident at his office, gesturing with his fork. Mama laughs, shaking her head. Catalina talks about her research project — "Estamos investigando el estres y el sueno" (We're researching stress and sleep). Daniel complains about a difficult math test. Everyone eats steadily — plates diminishing, limonada glasses being refilled from the pitcher. The conversation flows naturally in Spanish, overlapping, animated, affectionate. This is the heart of the Colombian family evening.

### Scene 231: Daniel Reaching for More Food
**Time:** 6:48 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table
**Description:** Daniel reaches across the table to serve himself a second helping from the pot, spooning more arroz con pollo onto his plate. Mama gently chides him: "Usa el cucharon, Daniel" (Use the serving spoon, Daniel). He grins and complies, using the proper serving spoon. Catalina shakes her head at her brother. Papa butters another arepa, spreading it thick. The pot is half-empty now, the family eating heartily. Glasses of limonada are refreshed from the pitcher.

### Scene 232: Catalina Eating Arepa with Avocado
**Time:** 6:52 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, close-up
**Description:** Catalina tears off a piece of arepa and tops it with a slice of avocado, creating a small open-faced bite. She brings the combination to her mouth — the warm, slightly crunchy corn bread with the cool, creamy avocado. Crumbs fall to her plate. The arepa's golden surface contrasts with the green avocado. She chews, eyes half-closed in enjoyment. This simple combination is a staple of Colombian meals — arepa and aguacate together.

### Scene 233: Mama Telling a Story
**Time:** 6:58 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, focus on mama
**Description:** Mama leans forward, telling an animated story about something that happened at the supermercado (supermarket) today. Her hands gesture expressively, her eyes wide with comedic timing. The whole family watches, fork-motion paused. Then the punchline — everyone laughs, Daniel nearly spitting his limonada. Catalina covers her mouth, shaking with laughter. Papa reaches over to pat mama's hand affectionately. The moment captures the warmth and humor of Colombian family dinners.

### Scene 234: Finishing Dinner
**Time:** 7:05 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table
**Description:** The family finishes eating. Plates are mostly clean — smears of rice and sauce remaining. The pot in the center is nearly empty, just a few spoonfuls left. Glasses of limonada are drained to ice cubes. Napkins are crumpled on the table. Everyone leans back slightly, satisfied. Papa loosens his belt a notch. Mama begins stacking plates. The conversation continues in a softer, post-meal tone — comfortable, unhurried, familial.

### Scene 235: Clearing the Table
**Time:** 7:08 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Dining table to kitchen
**Description:** Catalina stands and begins collecting empty plates, stacking them carefully. She picks up the glasses in the other hand, fingers hooked through two at a time. Daniel collects the napkins and leftover arepa plate. Mama carries the nearly empty pot back to the kitchen. Papa folds the newspaper he had retrieved and heads to the living room. The table is cleared quickly — a practiced family routine. Catalina carries the stack of dishes toward the kitchen sink.

### Scene 236: Washing Dishes
**Time:** 7:10 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen sink
**Description:** Catalina stands at the kitchen sink, washing dishes. She squeezes green dish soap from a bottle onto a yellow sponge, creating suds. Her hands scrub a ceramic plate under running water, food remnants dissolving into the stream. Clean dishes are stacked in the dish rack to the right — plates standing upright, glasses inverted. The kitchen window above the sink is dark now, reflecting her image back. Mama dries dishes beside her with a striped kitchen towel, and they chat quietly about Catalina's afternoon — a companionable mother-daughter moment.

### Scene 237: Drying Last Dish
**Time:** 7:18 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen sink area
**Description:** Catalina rinses the last glass under the faucet and places it in the dish rack. She turns off the water. The sink is empty and clean, suds draining down. She dries her hands on the striped kitchen towel and hangs it on the oven handle. The kitchen is tidy — counters wiped, stove clean, dishes in the rack. Mama has already left the kitchen. The overhead light buzzes softly. Catalina turns off the main kitchen light, leaving only a small nightlight above the stove.

### Scene 238: Moving to Living Room
**Time:** 7:20 PM — warm evening light
**Setting:** Hallway to living room
**Description:** Catalina walks from the kitchen through the hallway to the living room (sala). The hallway is dim, lit by the glow from the living room ahead. Family photos on the walls are shadowed. She can hear the television — a telenovela theme song playing. Papa's voice and Daniel's laughter come from the sala. She pushes through the archway into the warm, lamp-lit living room, ready to relax after a long day.

---

## PART 12: EVENING ROUTINE (7:30 PM - 9:30 PM)

### Scene 239: Sitting on Sofa — Watching TV
**Time:** 7:25 PM — warm lamp light and TV glow
**Setting:** Living room (sala)
**Description:** Catalina sinks into the family sofa — a large, well-worn brown leather couch with colorful throw pillows (traditional Colombian woven patterns in red, yellow, and green). Papa sits in an armchair beside the sofa, feet up on a small ottoman. Daniel sprawls on the other end of the couch. Mama joins, sitting beside Catalina. The television (a flat-screen on a wooden TV stand) plays a Colombian telenovela — dramatic faces, lush sets, Spanish dialogue. A floor lamp with a warm shade illuminates the room. The coffee table holds a remote control, a vase of fresh flowers, and a few magazines.

### Scene 240: Watching Telenovela Together
**Time:** 7:30 PM — TV glow and lamp light
**Setting:** Living room, family on sofa
**Description:** The family watches the telenovela together. The screen shows a dramatic scene — a woman confronting a man in an elegant living room, rapid-fire Spanish dialogue. Mama leans forward, invested in the plot. Papa watches with mild interest, occasionally making a sarcastic comment that makes everyone laugh. Daniel checks his phone but looks up at key moments. Catalina watches, legs tucked under her on the sofa, a throw pillow hugged to her chest. The blue-white TV light plays across their faces.

### Scene 241: Mama Making Hot Chocolate
**Time:** 7:40 PM — kitchen light spilling into living room
**Setting:** Kitchen, visible from living room
**Description:** Through the archway, mama is visible in the kitchen making evening chocolate caliente for the family. She stirs a pot on the stove, dropping in tablets of Colombian chocolate (Luker or Corona brand — dark, round tablets in a yellow wrapper) and adding milk. She uses a traditional wooden molinillo (whisk stick) to froth the chocolate, spinning it between her palms. The rich chocolate aroma drifts into the living room. The stove's blue flame flickers beneath the pot.

### Scene 242: Receiving Hot Chocolate
**Time:** 7:45 PM — warm living room
**Setting:** Living room, sofa
**Description:** Mama carries a small tray with four ceramic mugs of hot chocolate from the kitchen to the living room. Each mug steams fragrantly. A small plate of buñuelos (golden fried cheese balls) accompanies the drinks — a classic Colombian evening snack. Catalina takes a mug from the tray with both hands, wrapping her fingers around the warm ceramic. She blows across the surface, creating small ripples in the thick chocolate. The telenovela continues on the screen.

### Scene 243: Dunking Buñuelo in Chocolate
**Time:** 7:47 PM — warm living room
**Setting:** Sofa, close-up
**Description:** Catalina picks up a golden buñuelo from the plate on the coffee table and dunks it partially into her mug of hot chocolate. The crispy exterior absorbs the dark liquid, softening slightly. She takes a bite — the combination of crispy, cheesy fried dough with rich hot chocolate is quintessentially Colombian. Crumbs fall onto her hoodie. She brushes them away absently, eyes still on the telenovela. Daniel reaches for the last buñuelo — Catalina playfully slaps his hand. Sibling rivalry over snacks.

### Scene 244: Excusing Self — Going to Study
**Time:** 7:55 PM — warm living room
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** During a commercial break, Catalina sets her empty chocolate mug on the coffee table, stretches, and stands from the sofa. "Tengo que estudiar" (I have to study), she announces. Mama nods approvingly. Papa says "Buena niña" (Good girl). Daniel waves dismissively, already absorbed in his phone now that the telenovela is on break. Catalina picks up her empty mug and the buñuelo plate and carries them to the kitchen before heading to her room.

### Scene 245: Walking to Bedroom
**Time:** 7:58 PM — dim hallway
**Setting:** Hallway
**Description:** Catalina walks down the hallway toward her bedroom. The hallway is dim, lit by the glow spilling from the living room behind her and a small nightlight plugged into a wall outlet. She collects her mochila from the entry table where she dropped it earlier. The backpack is heavy with books and laptop. She pushes open her bedroom door with her hip, entering the room she left 12 hours ago.

### Scene 246: Entering Bedroom — Turning on Light
**Time:** 8:00 PM — bedroom light turning on
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Catalina flicks the light switch as she enters her bedroom. The overhead light illuminates the room — the bed with its floral comforter (still unmade from the morning), the dresser with its mirror and scattered hair products, the desk in the corner with textbooks and closed laptop, the armario, the poster on the wall. The light blue curtains are open, showing a dark sky with city lights through the window. She drops her mochila beside the desk chair and exhales — time for homework.

### Scene 247: Sitting at Desk
**Time:** 8:02 PM — bright desk lamp
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina sits at her small wooden desk, pulling the chair in. She turns on a desk lamp (adjustable silver arm with a bright white LED bulb), angling it over the workspace. The desk surface holds a few textbooks stacked, a jar of pens and pencils, a small cactus plant in a terracotta pot, and a framed photo of her and Laura making silly faces. She unzips her mochila on the floor beside her and begins pulling out her laptop, notebook, and the research project handout.

### Scene 248: Opening Laptop for Homework
**Time:** 8:03 PM — desk lamp and screen glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina opens her sticker-covered laptop on the desk. The screen illuminates her face with cool blue light, contrasting with the warm desk lamp. She opens a browser and navigates to the UNAL virtual campus portal — "Sistema de Informacion Academica" with the university logo. She checks upcoming assignment deadlines: a research paper abstract due next week, a reading response due in three days. She opens a Word document and starts working, the cursor blinking on a mostly empty page.

### Scene 249: Writing Research Abstract
**Time:** 8:10 PM — desk lamp and screen glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk, close-up on screen
**Description:** Catalina types her research project abstract in Spanish. The Word document shows: "Resumen: Este estudio busca examinar la relacion entre el estres academico y la calidad del sueno en estudiantes universitarios de pregrado de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia..." Her fingers move across the keyboard at a steady pace. The research papers she downloaded earlier are open in browser tabs for reference. Her notebook with afternoon notes sits propped open beside the laptop. The desk lamp casts a focused pool of light on the workspace.

### Scene 250: Referencing Textbook
**Time:** 8:25 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina flips through her Psychology textbook, searching for a specific passage. She finds it — a section on "Modelos de Estres Academico" — and reads, finger tracing the lines. She then turns to her laptop and types a citation in APA format, fingers moving between the book and keyboard. The textbook pages are dog-eared and highlighted from earlier study. Her brow furrows in concentration as she paraphrases a key finding into her own words.

### Scene 251: Phone Buzzing — WhatsApp Messages
**Time:** 8:35 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina's phone buzzes on the desk — multiple WhatsApp notifications. She picks it up. The screen shows messages in the "Proyecto Metodos" group: Valentina has shared her literature review outline, Carlos asks a question about the methodology section. Catalina types a quick response: "Se ve bien, Valen. Carlos, yo reviso eso manana." She also has a personal message from Mariana with a funny TikTok link. She smiles, saves it for later, and sets the phone face-down. Back to work.

### Scene 252: Stretching at Desk
**Time:** 8:50 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina leans back in her desk chair, arms above her head, fingers interlaced, stretching her back after nearly an hour of sitting. She rolls her neck left, then right, hearing small cracks. Her eyes are slightly tired from screen time. The laptop screen shows her Word document — now over two pages of her research abstract and introduction draft. She blinks a few times, rubs her eyes, and leans forward again. The rest of the house is quiet now — the telenovela has ended, the family settling into their own evening routines.

### Scene 253: Making Phone Call to Laura
**Time:** 8:55 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Bedroom, sitting on bed
**Description:** Catalina picks up her phone and makes a WhatsApp voice call to Laura. She moves from the desk to sit on her bed, legs crossed, leaning against the headboard. The phone is pressed to her ear. The call connects and she speaks in rapid, casual Spanish — talking about the research project, a funny thing that happened in class, weekend plans. She laughs at something Laura says, throwing her head back. Her face is relaxed, the social connection unwinding the day's academic tension. The bedroom is cozy — desk lamp on, overhead light off, a warm amber glow.

### Scene 254: Ending Phone Call
**Time:** 9:05 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, on bed
**Description:** Catalina says "Bueno, chao chao, hablamos manana" (OK, bye bye, we'll talk tomorrow) and taps the end-call button on her phone. The screen shows the call duration: 10 minutes. She smiles, feeling recharged from the conversation. She sits for a moment on the bed, checking Instagram briefly — scrolling through a few posts, liking a photo from a classmate, watching a short reel of a cat video. Then she locks the phone and sets it on the nightstand. Time to finish up.

### Scene 255: Returning to Desk — Final Study
**Time:** 9:08 PM — desk lamp light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina returns to her desk and reads through what she has written, making small edits — changing a word here, fixing a comma there. She highlights a sentence in yellow to remind herself to revise it tomorrow. The Word document is now three pages. She saves the file (Ctrl+G — guardar), the save icon briefly appearing. Satisfied with the progress, she begins closing browser tabs one by one. The research papers, the UNAL portal, the citation generator — all close until only the desktop wallpaper (Bogota sunset) remains.

### Scene 256: Closing Laptop
**Time:** 9:15 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina gently closes her laptop lid. The screen light disappears, leaving only the warm desk lamp illuminating the workspace. She stacks her notebook on top of the closed laptop, places the pencil case beside them. The USB drive goes into the mochila's small pocket. She pushes the chair back and stands, stretching one more time. Her textbook is bookmarked to the chapter she was referencing. The desk is organized for tomorrow — everything in its place.

### Scene 257: Preparing Mochila for Tomorrow
**Time:** 9:18 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, on floor near desk
**Description:** Catalina kneels on the floor beside her mochila, repacking it for tomorrow. She checks the contents: laptop in sleeve, two notebooks (one for each class), pencil case, water bottle (which she sets aside to refill in the morning), wallet, transit card (TuLlave), USB drive. She adds a clean notebook that she needs for a different class tomorrow. The backpack is zipped, ready to go, and leaned against the desk leg. She brushes a piece of lint off the Colombian flag keychain.

---

## PART 13: BEDTIME (9:30 PM - 11:00 PM)

### Scene 258: Gathering Pajamas
**Time:** 9:20 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at dresser
**Description:** Catalina opens her dresser drawer and pulls out her pajamas — the same pink cotton t-shirt and gray shorts she wore this morning, now washed and folded. She sets them on the bed. She also grabs a clean pair of underwear from the drawer. The dresser mirror reflects her tired face — eyes slightly droopy, the energy of the day catching up. The desk lamp is still on, casting a warm glow. The armario door is slightly ajar. Her day clothes feel comfortable but lived-in after many hours.

### Scene 259: Taking Toiletry Bag to Bathroom
**Time:** 9:22 PM — dim hallway
**Setting:** Hallway
**Description:** Catalina walks down the hallway toward the bathroom, carrying her pink toiletry bag and the folded pajamas. The hallway is dim — the overhead light is off, just the nightlight and the glow from under Daniel's bedroom door (he is still awake, studying or gaming). The bathroom door is open, the light off. She reaches inside and flicks the switch. The fluorescent light buzzes on, illuminating the small bathroom. The tiles gleam. The family toothbrushes wait in their holder.

### Scene 260: Entering Bathroom — Evening
**Time:** 9:23 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom
**Description:** Catalina enters the bathroom and sets her toiletry bag on the counter. The bathroom looks familiar from the morning but feels different at night — the frosted window is dark, the fluorescent light the only source. The tile floor is cool on her socked feet. She sets her pajamas on the closed toilet lid. The bathroom is dry and clean from the day — no steam, no wet towels. The family toothbrushes stand in the holder, the Colgate toothpaste tube in its place.

### Scene 261: Washing Face — Evening Routine
**Time:** 9:24 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Catalina turns on the faucet and cups warm water in her hands, splashing it onto her face. Her eyes close as the water runs over her skin. She reaches into her toiletry bag and pulls out a facial cleanser (a small tube with Spanish text — "Limpiador Facial"). She squeezes a small amount into her palm and works it into a gentle lather, massaging it across her face in circular motions — forehead, cheeks, nose, chin. The lather is white and creamy. She rinses with more warm water.

### Scene 262: Applying Toner
**Time:** 9:26 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Catalina pours a small amount of facial toner from a clear bottle onto a cotton pad (round, white). She dabs it across her face — forehead, cheeks, under her jaw. The toner is slightly cooling. She examines her reflection in the mirror — her skin is clean and slightly damp, medium brown and clear. The cotton pad shows a faint discoloration from the day's accumulated grime. She tosses it into a small wastebasket beside the sink.

### Scene 263: Applying Night Cream
**Time:** 9:27 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Catalina dips her fingers into a small jar of night cream (a white jar with a purple lid, Colombian brand) and dots the cream on her forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. She blends it in with gentle upward strokes, the thick cream absorbing into her skin. Her reflection shows the careful application — fingers moving across her face methodically. The cream leaves a slight dewy sheen on her skin. She screws the lid back on the jar and returns it to the toiletry bag.

### Scene 264: Brushing Teeth — Evening
**Time:** 9:29 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Catalina squeezes Colgate toothpaste onto her pink toothbrush and begins brushing, the same routine as morning but in reverse context — nighttime, winding down. Her reflection in the mirror shows the circular brushing motion. White foam builds. She brushes thoroughly — top, bottom, sides, tongue. The fluorescent light is harsh but familiar. Through the wall, she can faintly hear the television in the living room — papa watching the late news.

### Scene 265: Spitting and Rinsing — Evening
**Time:** 9:31 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Catalina spits toothpaste foam into the sink and rinses her mouth with cupped water. She rinses the toothbrush under the faucet, taps it against the sink edge twice, and replaces it in the ceramic holder. She cups more water and takes a final rinse, swishing and spitting. The sink is clean, the faucet turned off. She pats her mouth dry with a small hand towel. Her teeth are clean, her breath fresh with mint.

### Scene 266: Changing into Pajamas
**Time:** 9:33 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom
**Description:** Catalina changes into her pajamas in the bathroom — pulling off her gray hoodie, white t-shirt, and jeans, folding them loosely and stacking them. She pulls on the pink cotton t-shirt and gray pajama shorts. The familiar soft fabric feels comforting against her skin after a full day in jeans and hoodie. She bundles her day clothes under one arm. Her hair is still down, falling over the pink t-shirt. She looks at herself in the mirror — the same Catalina from 6:00 AM, now 15 hours later.

### Scene 267: Taking Down Hair
**Time:** 9:35 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Catalina runs her fingers through her long dark hair, which has been down all day. She detangles gently with her fingers, pulling out a few loose strands. She considers tying it up for sleep — grabbing a soft scrunchie from her toiletry bag, she gathers her hair into a loose, low bun at the nape of her neck. The bun is softer than the morning ponytail — a sleeping style that will not pull or tangle. A few strands frame her face.

### Scene 268: Returning to Bedroom in Pajamas
**Time:** 9:37 PM — dim hallway
**Setting:** Hallway to bedroom
**Description:** Catalina exits the bathroom, flicking off the light behind her. She walks down the dim hallway in her pink pajama t-shirt and gray shorts, carrying her folded day clothes and toiletry bag. Her white chanclas (slip-on sandals) are on her feet again. The house is quieter now — Daniel's light is off (he has gone to bed), the TV in the living room murmurs quietly. She enters her bedroom, the desk lamp still providing a warm glow.

### Scene 269: Putting Away Day Clothes
**Time:** 9:38 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Catalina places her folded day clothes on the dresser — the jeans she will wear again tomorrow, the hoodie folded on top. The white t-shirt goes into the laundry hamper in the corner. She hangs the hoodie on the back of her desk chair for easy access in the morning. The toiletry bag goes back onto the dresser beside her hair products. The room is settling into its nighttime configuration — desk tidy, mochila packed, clothes laid out.

### Scene 270: Plugging in Phone Charger
**Time:** 9:40 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Catalina picks up her phone from the nightstand and plugs it into the charger cable — a white USB cable that snakes to an adapter plugged into the wall outlet beside the bed. The phone screen lights up briefly showing the battery at 18% and a charging lightning bolt icon. She sets the phone face-down on the nightstand beside the lamp, the water glass (now empty from the morning), and the family photo. The charger cable coils across the nightstand surface.

### Scene 271: Refilling Water Glass
**Time:** 9:41 PM — soft light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Catalina picks up the empty water glass from the nightstand and walks to the bathroom sink to refill it. She returns with the glass full of cool water and sets it carefully on the nightstand. A few droplets run down the outside of the glass. The water catches the light from the desk lamp, creating a small bright spot. It will be there when she wakes — her first drink of the morning, completing the daily cycle.

### Scene 272: Setting Alarm for Morning
**Time:** 9:43 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, sitting on bed
**Description:** Catalina sits on the edge of the bed and picks up her phone. She opens the alarm app, confirming tomorrow's alarm is set for 6:00 AM. The screen shows "Alarma — 6:00 AM — Lunes a Viernes" with a toggle switch in the on position. She double-checks the time, nods, and locks the phone. The screen goes dark. She sets it back on the nightstand, face-down beside the water glass. Tomorrow will repeat much of today — another university weekday.

### Scene 273: Making Bed Slightly
**Time:** 9:45 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Catalina pulls back the floral comforter and straightens the white sheets beneath — not a full bed-making, just enough to create a clean surface to sleep on. The comforter folds back, revealing the white sheets and pillow. She fluffs the pillow — a single white pillow in a cotton pillowcase — and sets it against the headboard. The familiar colors of the floral comforter (yellows, pinks, blues) are warm in the desk lamp light.

### Scene 274: Sitting on Bed — Scrolling Phone
**Time:** 9:47 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, on bed
**Description:** Catalina sits propped against her pillow on the bed, legs under the sheet, scrolling through her phone one last time. Instagram stories from friends play — Laura at a restaurant, Mariana posing with her dog, Carlos sharing a meme. She double-taps to like a few posts. Then she opens TikTok briefly — a compilation of funny Colombian content, a cooking video for patacones, a university memes account. The blue phone light illuminates her face in the otherwise softly lit room. Her eyes are heavy but the content keeps pulling her in.

### Scene 275: Closing Social Media
**Time:** 9:55 PM — soft bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, on bed
**Description:** Catalina catches herself doom-scrolling and locks her phone with a deliberate press of the side button. The screen goes black. She sets it firmly on the nightstand, face-down. "Ya, a dormir" (OK, time to sleep), she murmurs to herself. The blue screen light disappears, and the room returns to the warm amber glow of the desk lamp. Her eyes adjust, blinking. The bedroom is peaceful — the night sounds of Bogota barely audible through the window, a dog barking distantly, the hum of the house settling.

### Scene 276: Turning Off Desk Lamp
**Time:** 9:57 PM — bedroom going dark
**Setting:** Bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Catalina reaches from the bed to the desk and clicks off the desk lamp. The bright white LED disappears, plunging the room into near-darkness. Only the faint glow from the nightlight in the hallway seeping under the door, and the distant city lights through the curtains, provide any illumination. Her eyes need a moment to adjust. The room takes on blue-gray shadows. The familiar shapes of furniture — dresser, desk, armario — become dark silhouettes.

### Scene 277: Closing Curtains
**Time:** 9:58 PM — dark bedroom
**Setting:** Bedroom, at window
**Description:** Catalina gets up briefly and pulls the light blue curtains fully closed, blocking the city lights that filter through. The room darkens further. Through a crack in the curtains, a sliver of orange streetlight is visible. She can see the faintest outline of the Andes mountains against the night sky. The window glass is cool to the touch. She pulls the curtains tighter and turns back toward the bed, navigating by memory in the darkness.

### Scene 278: Getting into Bed
**Time:** 10:00 PM — dark bedroom
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Catalina slides under the white sheet and pulls the floral comforter up over herself. The familiar weight of the blanket settles over her body. She adjusts her position — lying on her side, knees slightly bent, one arm under the pillow. The mattress gives comfortably beneath her. The pillow is cool against her cheek. She exhales a long, slow breath. The room is quiet and dark. The house is silent now — everyone asleep or nearly so.

### Scene 279: Lying in Bed — Thoughts Drifting
**Time:** 10:05 PM — dark bedroom
**Setting:** Bedroom, in bed, close-up on face
**Description:** Catalina lies in bed, eyes open in the darkness, staring at the ceiling. Her mind runs through the day — the morning rush, the classes, the research project, the group brainstorming, the crowded TransMilenio, mama's arroz con pollo, the telenovela, homework. Tomorrow she needs to finish the research abstract, meet with the group, and attend two more classes. Her breathing slows. The low bun presses against the pillow. The floral comforter rises and falls with her breaths. Gradually, her eyelids grow heavy.

### Scene 280: Adjusting Position
**Time:** 10:10 PM — dark bedroom
**Setting:** Bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Catalina shifts in bed, rolling from her side onto her back. The comforter rustles. She adjusts the pillow, folding it slightly to raise her head. One arm rests on her stomach over the comforter, the other beside her. The ceiling is invisible in the darkness. The faint sound of a car passing on the street outside, its headlights sweeping a brief stripe of light across the curtains and ceiling, then gone. Silence returns.

### Scene 281: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 10:15 PM — dark bedroom
**Setting:** Bedroom, wide view
**Description:** Catalina lies still under the floral comforter, eyes closed, breathing slow and even. Her face is peaceful, the tension of the day fully released. One hand curls beside her face on the pillow. Her long dark hair, still in the loose low bun, rests against the white pillowcase. The room is perfectly quiet and dark. The nightstand holds the silent phone (charging, screen dark), the full water glass, the family photo, and the small white lamp — all still and waiting. The alarm is set. Another day in the life of Catalina is complete. In eight hours, the phone will glow again at 6:00 AM, and the cycle will begin anew.
