Queen bed with a Navajo-pattern wool blanket/throw draped across the foot, white sheets, two pillows. Wooden nightstands on each side — David's has an early-set alarm clock (4:55 AM), a phone charger, and a small ceramic tray holding his turquoise pendant necklace. Sarah's nightstand has a reading lamp and a book. A wooden dresser against one wall with a framed family photo (David, Sarah, Nathan, Emma) and a small potted succulent. A pair of brown leather work boots sits by the closet door. A small Navajo rug (red, black, gray geometric pattern) lies on the hardwood floor beside the bed. A desert landscape painting hangs on the wall — red mesas under a vast sky. The window faces east, showing Albuquerque sky and the Sandia Mountains in the distance. A ceiling fan turns slowly overhead. The room is warm-toned, simple, and uncluttered — a working man's room.",

Power tools are staged on sawhorses: a circular saw, a nail gun, a power drill. A stack of blueprints/plans is spread on a sheet of plywood supported by two sawhorses, serving as a makeshift table. Orange safety cones mark the perimeter. A yellow hard hat hangs on a nail driven into a stud. Orange safety fencing lines one edge of the site. A large blue dumpster sits at the far corner. Several crew trucks (pickups) are parked in a row, including David's dark blue Ford F-150 with the toolbox in the bed. A portable toilet (port-a-potty) stands off to the side. A large orange water cooler sits on a folding table near the trucks. The New Mexico desert landscape surrounds the site — dry sandy ground, scrub brush, clear blue sky, and the Sandia Mountains rising in the background. Bright, harsh sunlight with sharp shadows.",
