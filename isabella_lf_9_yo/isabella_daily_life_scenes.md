## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — BEDROOM (6:00 AM - 6:20 AM)

### Scene 001: Pre-Dawn Bedroom
**Time:** 6:00 AM — pale gray-blue pre-dawn light through window
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, wide view from doorway
**Description:** A small child's bedroom in a Cartagena house, quiet and still in the early morning. A 9-year-old Colombian girl with brown skin and long dark curly hair sleeps in a small wooden bed with a light cotton sheet printed with butterflies in pastel colors. The room has pale pink walls with a few cartoon character posters and a hand-drawn picture of a parrot taped beside the window. A small wooden desk sits against one wall, cluttered with colored pencils in a tin cup, a sketchbook, and a few school notebooks. A wooden chair is tucked under the desk. A small bookshelf holds children's books, a plastic container of hair ribbons, and two stuffed animals — a worn teddy bear and a plush dolphin. The window is open with thin cotton curtains that shift slightly in the warm Caribbean air. A ceiling fan turns slowly overhead. The tile floor is cool and bare except for a small woven rug beside the bed. Pale gray-blue pre-dawn light seeps through the curtains.

### Scene 002: Abuela at the Doorway
**Time:** 6:02 AM — soft gray morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom doorway, view into room
**Description:** Abuela Dona Mercedes, a 62-year-old Colombian woman with silver-streaked dark hair pulled back in a loose bun, stands in the bedroom doorway. She wears a light cotton house dress with a blue floral print and simple house slippers. Her hand rests on the wooden door frame. She leans slightly into the room, mouth open as if calling softly — "Isabella, mi amor, arriba." The hallway behind her is lit by a single overhead light. Inside the bedroom, Isabella is still curled under the butterfly sheet, only the top of her dark curly hair visible against the pillow. The ceiling fan spins lazily. Morning light is barely beginning to warm the thin curtains.

### Scene 003: Stirring Awake
**Time:** 6:04 AM — growing gray-blue light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Isabella stirs under the butterfly sheet, rolling onto her back. Her dark curly hair is spread messily across the white pillow. She wears a light cotton nightgown with small pink flowers printed on it, the fabric thin and airy for the Caribbean heat. One small brown hand rubs her eye. Her face is scrunched in that half-awake expression of a child resisting morning. The worn teddy bear lies beside her on the pillow. The plush dolphin has fallen to the floor during the night. The sheet is tangled around her legs.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 6:06 AM — soft warm morning light beginning
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, side view of bed
**Description:** Isabella sits up slowly in bed, legs still under the butterfly sheet. Her dark curly hair is a wild tangle around her face and shoulders, pressed flat on one side from sleep. She yawns widely, both small hands stretching above her head, fingers spread. Her light cotton nightgown with pink flowers hangs loosely on her small frame. The teddy bear sits propped against the pillow beside where her head was. On the small wooden nightstand next to the bed, a pink plastic alarm clock shows 6:06, and a half-empty glass of water catches the first hint of golden light coming through the curtains. The ceiling fan hums quietly above.

### Scene 005: Feet on the Tile Floor
**Time:** 6:07 AM — warm early morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, low angle close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's small bare feet swinging over the edge of the wooden bed and touching the cool tile floor. The tiles are cream-colored ceramic, typical of Cartagena houses. A small woven rug in bright colors — red, yellow, green — sits just beside the bed, but her feet have landed on the bare tile instead. The bottom hem of her pink-flowered nightgown is visible above her ankles. Her toes curl slightly at the coolness of the tile. Under the bed, a pair of pink rubber flip-flops and a stray colored pencil are visible in the shadow.

### Scene 006: Picking Up the Dolphin
**Time:** 6:08 AM — warm golden light growing
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, view from bed level
**Description:** Isabella bends down from the edge of the bed, reaching for the plush dolphin that fell on the floor during the night. Her dark curly hair cascades forward, obscuring part of her face. Her small hand grabs the light blue plush dolphin by its tail. The woven rug is beneath her feet now. The wooden nightstand with the pink alarm clock and water glass is visible beside her. She places the dolphin back on the pillow next to the teddy bear, patting it gently as if apologizing for letting it fall.

### Scene 007: Walking to the Window
**Time:** 6:09 AM — golden Caribbean morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, view toward window
**Description:** Isabella walks across the tile floor toward the bedroom window, still in her nightgown, bare feet padding softly. She pushes aside the thin cotton curtain with one hand and looks outside. Through the window, the view shows a Cartagena neighborhood waking up: colorful houses in yellows, blues, and oranges with balconies draped in bougainvillea, a narrow street below, the first hints of tropical morning sun turning the sky pink and gold. A palm tree sways gently nearby. The warm Caribbean air comes through the open window, ruffling the curtain and Isabella's messy curls. Her face is lit golden by the sunrise, eyes wide and alert now.

### Scene 008: Making the Bed
**Time:** 6:11 AM — bright warm morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, view of bed
**Description:** Isabella stands beside her bed, pulling the butterfly-print cotton sheet up toward the pillow with both hands. The sheet bunches unevenly — a child's effort at bed-making, earnest but imperfect. She smooths it with her palms, pressing out wrinkles. The teddy bear and plush dolphin sit on the pillow, watching. The wooden headboard is simple, painted white with a few sticker decorations — a star, a heart, a cartoon cat. Morning sunlight now streams fully through the window, casting warm rectangles of light across the bed and tile floor. The ceiling fan shadow rotates slowly across the sheet.

### Scene 009: Placing Stuffed Animals on Pillow
**Time:** 6:13 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Isabella arranges her stuffed animals on the now-made bed with careful attention. She props the worn teddy bear against the pillow on the left side and the plush dolphin on the right, then adjusts them so they face forward. Her small hands position them just so. A smaller stuffed cat — orange with white stripes — gets tucked between the two larger animals. The butterfly sheet is pulled up neatly beneath the pillow. The white-painted headboard with its sticker decorations frames the arrangement. Isabella steps back, hands on her hips, surveying her work with satisfaction.

### Scene 010: Choosing Ribbons for the Day
**Time:** 6:15 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at the bookshelf
**Description:** Isabella stands at the small bookshelf beside her desk, reaching for the plastic container of hair ribbons on the second shelf. The container is transparent, filled with ribbons in every color — red, pink, yellow, green, blue, white, purple — along with hair ties, small butterfly clips, and a few plastic barrettes. She pulls out the container and sets it on the desk, rummaging through the tangle of ribbons. Her fingers select two bright red ribbons, holding them up to the light from the window, then nodding to herself. The desk surface behind the container shows her sketchbook with a half-finished drawing of a parrot, the tin cup of colored pencils, and a couple of school notebooks with curled edges.

### Scene 011: Gathering Uniform from Chair
**Time:** 6:17 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, near desk chair
**Description:** Isabella picks up her school uniform from where it hangs neatly on the back of the wooden desk chair — mama prepared it the night before. She drapes the white short-sleeved uniform shirt over her arm, then picks up the navy blue pleated skirt from the chair seat. White knee-high socks are folded together on the desk corner. Her black school shoes sit on the floor beneath the chair, polished and ready. The two red ribbons she selected lie on the desk next to the ribbon container. She holds the uniform pieces carefully, trying not to wrinkle them, and turns toward the bedroom door to head to the bathroom.

---

## PART 2: BATHROOM & GETTING READY (6:20 AM - 6:50 AM)

### Scene 012: Walking Down the Hallway
**Time:** 6:20 AM — hallway light mixed with morning sun
**Setting:** Upstairs hallway, viewed from behind Isabella
**Description:** Isabella walks down the narrow upstairs hallway toward the bathroom, her school uniform draped over one arm, the two red ribbons clutched in her other hand. She still wears her pink-flowered nightgown, bare feet on the tile hallway floor. The hallway walls are painted a warm cream color. Family photographs in simple frames line the wall — a baby photo of Isabella, Sebastian's school portrait, mama and papa's wedding photo, a faded photograph of abuela as a young woman. A carved wooden crucifix hangs near the bathroom door. The bathroom door ahead is open, light already on inside. From somewhere downstairs, the faint clatter of pots indicates abuela has started preparing breakfast.

### Scene 013: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:21 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom doorway
**Description:** Isabella steps into the family bathroom, setting her folded uniform and ribbons on a small wooden stool just inside the door. The bathroom is modest but clean: white ceramic tile walls and floor, a single pedestal sink with a chrome faucet, a round mirror mounted above it, a toilet with a plastic seat, and a shower area in the corner with a plastic curtain printed with tropical fish. A blue plastic step stool sits in front of the sink — Isabella's, so she can reach the faucet comfortably. Colorful towels hang on hooks on the wall: a large blue one (Sebastian's), a large green one (mama's), and a smaller pink one with a cartoon mermaid (Isabella's). A fluorescent tube light on the ceiling casts bright, even light across the small space.

### Scene 014: Stepping onto the Step Stool
**Time:** 6:22 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at the sink
**Description:** Isabella steps up onto the blue plastic step stool in front of the pedestal sink, rising to a comfortable height to see herself in the round mirror. Her reflection shows a sleepy-faced 9-year-old with wild dark curls, still in her nightgown. The mirror also reflects the tropical fish shower curtain behind her. On the narrow shelf below the mirror, a plastic cup holds three toothbrushes — a pink child's toothbrush (Isabella's), a green one (Sebastian's), and a white adult one (mama's). A tube of children's strawberry-flavored toothpaste with a cartoon character on it stands beside the cup. A bar of soap sits in a small ceramic dish next to the faucet. Isabella grips the edge of the sink, steadying herself on the stool.

### Scene 015: Turning on the Faucet
**Time:** 6:22 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on sink
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's small brown hands turning the chrome faucet handle on the pedestal sink. Water begins to flow from the faucet, splashing into the white ceramic basin. Her fingers grip the handle and twist. The water runs cool — refreshing in the Cartagena heat even at this early hour. The soap dish with its bar of white soap is visible beside the faucet. The edge of the plastic cup with toothbrushes appears at the corner of the frame. A few water droplets land on the narrow shelf.

### Scene 016: Splashing Water on Face
**Time:** 6:23 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, side view at sink
**Description:** Isabella leans over the sink, standing on the blue step stool, cupping water in both small hands and splashing it onto her face. Water runs down her brown cheeks and drips from her chin into the basin. Her eyes are squeezed shut against the water. Her dark curly hair falls forward around her face. The nightgown sleeves are pushed up to her elbows to keep them dry. The faucet runs steadily. Droplets of water spatter the mirror slightly. The cool water wakes her up fully — her expression shifts from sleepy to alert.

### Scene 017: Drying Face with Towel
**Time:** 6:24 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Isabella reaches for her pink mermaid towel hanging on its hook and presses it against her wet face. The small towel covers most of her face as she pats dry. Her dark curls are slightly damp at the edges near her forehead. Water spots remain on the sink edge and mirror. She lowers the towel, face now fresh and awake, and hangs it back on the hook carefully, making sure the mermaid design faces outward. The step stool creaks slightly under her shifting weight.

### Scene 018: Picking Up Toothbrush
**Time:** 6:25 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on shelf
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's hand reaching into the plastic cup on the shelf and pulling out her pink children's toothbrush. The bristles are slightly worn — she has had this toothbrush for a while. The green and white toothbrushes remain in the cup. She picks up the tube of strawberry children's toothpaste with her other hand. The tube has a cartoon strawberry character on the label and is squeezed in the middle — the mark of regular use. The cap is a flip-top that she pops open with her thumb.

### Scene 019: Squeezing Toothpaste
**Time:** 6:25 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on hands
**Description:** Extreme close-up of Isabella's hands holding the pink toothbrush in one hand and squeezing the strawberry toothpaste tube with the other. A blob of pink-tinted toothpaste curls onto the bristles — she squeezes a bit too much, and it bulges over the side of the brush. She tilts the brush to keep the toothpaste from falling off. The bathroom sink and faucet are blurred in the background. Her small fingers grip the tube firmly near the middle.

### Scene 020: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 6:26 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Isabella brushes her teeth with the pink toothbrush, moving it back and forth across her front teeth. Pink-white foam forms around her mouth. She watches herself in the round mirror, concentrating on getting the brushing right the way mama taught her. Her reflection shows a small brown-skinned girl with wild dark curls, nightgown, standing on the blue step stool, brushing vigorously. The strawberry toothpaste tube lies on its side on the shelf. She tilts her head to reach the back teeth, mouth open wide.

### Scene 021: Spitting Toothpaste Foam
**Time:** 6:28 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, side angle at sink
**Description:** Isabella leans over the sink and spits toothpaste foam into the basin. Pink-white foam swirls with the running water and slides toward the drain. She cups water in her hand, rinses her mouth, swishes, and spits again. She repeats once more, then wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. A few foam spots remain on the basin edge. She rinses those away with a splash of water before turning off the faucet.

### Scene 022: Putting Away Toothbrush and Toothpaste
**Time:** 6:29 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on shelf
**Description:** Isabella places her pink toothbrush back into the plastic cup on the shelf, bristles up, beside the green and white toothbrushes. She picks up the strawberry toothpaste tube, caps the flip-top with a press of her thumb, and stands it upright on the shelf next to the cup. She wipes a small smear of toothpaste from the shelf edge with her finger and rinses it under the faucet. The shelf is tidy again — three toothbrushes in the cup, the toothpaste tube standing beside it, the soap dish undisturbed. She steps back on the stool and checks her teeth in the mirror, pulling her lips back in an exaggerated grin to inspect.

### Scene 023: Removing Nightgown
**Time:** 6:30 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, near the stool with clothes
**Description:** Isabella pulls her pink-flowered nightgown up over her head, arms raised, the fabric bunching as it clears her dark curls. She folds it loosely and places it on the wooden stool. She stands in her underwear, small and thin-framed, brown skin smooth. The school uniform — white shirt and navy skirt — waits neatly folded on the stool beside the nightgown. The bathroom is warm, the Cartagena heat already building even at this hour. The tropical fish shower curtain and the row of colored towels fill the background.

### Scene 024: Putting on Uniform Shirt
**Time:** 6:31 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, mid-shot
**Description:** Isabella picks up the white short-sleeved uniform shirt from the stool and slips her arms through the sleeves. The shirt is crisp white cotton with a small school crest embroidered in blue thread on the left breast pocket — a shield with a book and a star. She buttons it from the bottom up with careful fingers, the small white buttons tricky for her hands. She tucks the front into the waistband of her underwear temporarily, concentrating on getting each button through its hole. The shirt is slightly too big — she'll grow into it, mama said.

### Scene 025: Stepping into the Skirt
**Time:** 6:33 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, full-length view
**Description:** Isabella steps into her navy blue pleated school skirt, pulling it up over her hips. The skirt has a small zipper on the side and a clasp at the waist. She zips it up with both hands, then fastens the clasp. The skirt falls to just above her knees, the pleats hanging neatly. She tucks the white shirt into the waistband, smoothing the fabric with her palms. She stands in front of the mirror to check — the white shirt is tucked in, the navy skirt sits properly. She adjusts the shirt collar, pulling it to lie flat over the neckline of the skirt.

### Scene 026: Returning to Bedroom for Socks and Shoes
**Time:** 6:35 AM — bright hallway light
**Setting:** Upstairs hallway, walking back toward bedroom
**Description:** Isabella walks back down the hallway from the bathroom to her bedroom, now wearing her white uniform shirt and navy skirt, bare feet on the tile floor. She carries the two red ribbons in one hand and her folded nightgown in the other. The family photos on the wall are lit by the morning sun coming through a hallway window. She passes Sebastian's closed bedroom door — a small sign reading "NO ENTRAR" (Do Not Enter) in his teenage handwriting is taped to it. She pushes open her own bedroom door with her elbow, entering the sunlit room.

### Scene 027: Sitting on Bed to Put on Socks
**Time:** 6:36 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, sitting on edge of bed
**Description:** Isabella sits on the edge of her made bed, the butterfly sheet smooth beneath her. She picks up the folded white knee-high socks from the desk corner and unfolds them. She stretches one sock open with both hands and pulls it onto her right foot, tugging it up past her calf to just below her knee. The sock is bright white, ribbed cotton, snug against her brown skin. She repeats with the left foot, pulling the second sock up evenly. She wiggles her toes inside the socks, checking the fit. The morning sunlight falls across the bed, warming her legs. The stuffed animals on the pillow watch the routine.

### Scene 028: Buckling School Shoes
**Time:** 6:38 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on feet
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's feet as she slides them into her black school shoes — simple black Mary Jane style with a single strap and silver buckle. She fastens the buckle on the right shoe, her small fingers working the metal prong through the leather hole. Then the left shoe. The black patent leather catches the morning light, polished the night before by mama. The shoes sit on the tile floor, white socks visible above them. The woven rug in red, yellow, and green is partially visible beside her feet.

### Scene 029: Sitting at Vanity for Hair
**Time:** 6:39 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at the desk used as vanity
**Description:** Isabella sits in the wooden desk chair, which has been turned to face the small mirror propped on the desk. The desk doubles as her getting-ready spot — the mirror is a small rectangular one with a pink plastic frame, leaned against the wall. The container of ribbons sits open on the desk. The two red ribbons she selected earlier lie beside a hairbrush with a pink handle and a spray bottle of detangler. Isabella waits, hands in her lap, looking toward the bedroom door expectantly. Her dark curly hair is still a wild tangle from sleep, poofing out in all directions.

### Scene 030: Abuela Arriving with Brush
**Time:** 6:40 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom doorway and desk area
**Description:** Abuela enters Isabella's bedroom carrying a wide-tooth comb and a small jar of coconut oil — her tools for taming Caribbean curls. She wears the same blue floral house dress and slippers. She sets the coconut oil jar on the desk beside the spray bottle and comb, then stands behind Isabella's chair. "A ver, mi princesa, vamos a peinarte," she says, picking up the spray bottle of detangler. Isabella sits up straight in the chair, bracing slightly — she knows the tangles will pull. The morning light illuminates both their faces in the mirror reflection.

### Scene 031: Spraying Detangler
**Time:** 6:41 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up from mirror's perspective
**Description:** Abuela holds sections of Isabella's dark curly hair up with one hand while spraying detangler with the other. The mist catches the morning light, creating tiny sparkles. Isabella's hair is thick, dark, and voluminous — typical of Caribbean Colombian curls. The spray bottle makes a soft pumping sound. Abuela works section by section, lifting hair from the nape of Isabella's neck upward. The desk mirror reflects Isabella's face — eyes slightly closed, tolerating the process. The coconut oil jar, wide-tooth comb, and ribbon container crowd the desk surface.

### Scene 032: Combing Out Tangles
**Time:** 6:42 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, side view
**Description:** Abuela draws the wide-tooth comb through Isabella's damp, detangled hair, starting from the ends and working upward — the proper technique for curly hair. Isabella winces as the comb catches a stubborn tangle near her left ear. Abuela murmurs "tranquila, tranquila" (easy, easy), holding the hair above the tangle to reduce pulling. Dark curls separate and lengthen as the comb passes through. Loose strands of hair cling to the comb. Isabella grips the edge of the desk chair seat with both hands, enduring patiently. The open window lets warm air circulate around them.

### Scene 033: Parting Hair Down the Middle
**Time:** 6:44 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on top of head
**Description:** Close-up of Abuela's weathered brown hands parting Isabella's now-combed dark hair straight down the middle with the tail end of the comb. A clean white line appears on Isabella's scalp, dividing the thick dark hair into two equal sections. Abuela's fingers are deft, practiced from decades of braiding hair — she braided mama's hair the same way. She clips one section to the side with a plastic butterfly clip from the container, keeping it out of the way while she works on the other side. The coconut oil jar is open now, a faint tropical scent in the air.

### Scene 034: Braiding the Right Side
**Time:** 6:45 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, three-quarter view
**Description:** Abuela stands behind the chair, fingers weaving Isabella's dark curls into a tight, neat braid on the right side of her head. Her hands move with practiced speed — over, under, pull, over, under, pull — gathering more hair as she works down from the scalp. Isabella sits still, eyes watching in the mirror as the braid takes shape. The left section of hair is still clipped up, waiting. Abuela's face shows concentration, lips slightly pursed. The braid extends past Isabella's shoulder, thick and dark against the white uniform shirt. Small curls escape at the temple, too short to be caught in the braid.

### Scene 035: Tying the First Red Ribbon
**Time:** 6:47 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on braid end
**Description:** Close-up of Abuela's hands securing the end of the right braid with a hair tie, then wrapping a bright red satin ribbon around the base and tying it into a neat bow. The red ribbon is vivid against Isabella's dark hair and brown skin. The bow has two perky loops and two trailing ends that hang a few inches. The braid is tight and smooth, ending in a small curl where the natural texture reasserts itself below the ribbon. Isabella's white-shirted shoulder is visible in the frame. The hair tie is a small black elastic, hidden beneath the ribbon.

### Scene 036: Braiding the Left Side
**Time:** 6:48 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, mirror reflection view
**Description:** Viewed through the desk mirror's reflection, Abuela now works on the left braid, removing the butterfly clip and beginning the weaving pattern. The completed right braid with its red ribbon bow hangs neatly over Isabella's right shoulder. Abuela's fingers move through the left section with the same expert rhythm. Isabella tilts her head slightly to give abuela better access. In the mirror, Isabella's face is relaxed now — the hard part of detangling is over, and braiding feels soothing. The bedroom behind them is bright with morning sun, the made bed with its stuffed animal lineup visible over Isabella's shoulder in the reflection.

### Scene 037: Tying the Second Red Ribbon
**Time:** 6:49 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on left braid
**Description:** Abuela ties the second red ribbon at the end of the left braid, matching the right side perfectly. Two bright red bows, same size, same shape, one on each braid. She adjusts the second bow, pulling one loop slightly to even it out. Isabella's two braids now hang symmetrically, dark and neat against the white uniform shirt, each ending in a cheerful red satin bow. Abuela steps back, hands on hips, admiring her work. A few small curls frame Isabella's forehead and temples where they were too short to braid.

### Scene 038: Checking Complete Look in Mirror
**Time:** 6:50 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at desk mirror
**Description:** Isabella stands from the chair and leans toward the desk mirror, turning her head left and right to inspect abuela's work. Her reflection shows the complete school look: white uniform shirt tucked into navy blue pleated skirt, white knee-high socks, black Mary Jane shoes, and two neat dark braids with red ribbon bows. She grins widely at herself, pleased. Her big brown eyes sparkle with energy. Abuela stands behind her, visible in the mirror, smiling with pride. The ribbon container, comb, spray bottle, and coconut oil jar are scattered across the desk — the evidence of the morning hair ritual.

### Scene 039: Abuela's Kiss on the Forehead
**Time:** 6:50 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on both faces
**Description:** Abuela cups Isabella's face gently in both weathered hands and plants a kiss on her forehead. Isabella's eyes close, a soft smile on her lips. Abuela's face is close, wrinkled at the corners of her eyes, her silver-streaked hair slightly loosened from the bun by the morning's work. "Lista, mi princesa," she says — ready, my princess. The moment is tender, a daily ritual between grandmother and granddaughter. The morning light catches them both in a warm glow. Isabella opens her eyes and takes abuela's hand, ready to go downstairs for breakfast.

## PART 3: BREAKFAST WITH FAMILY (6:50 AM - 7:20 AM)

### Scene 040: Coming Downstairs
**Time:** 6:50 AM — bright morning light on stairway
**Setting:** Staircase, viewed from below
**Description:** Isabella descends the wooden staircase, one small hand on the worn wooden railing, the other holding abuela's hand. She is fully dressed for school — white shirt, navy skirt, white socks, black shoes, braids with red ribbons. The stairway walls are painted warm yellow, typical of Cartagena interiors. Family photos in simple wooden frames line the wall — a posed family portrait, Isabella's first-day-of-school photo, Sebastian as a baby, abuela and abuelo's wedding photo (black and white, decades old). A small ceramic Virgin Mary figurine sits in a niche in the wall at the stairway landing. Morning light streams up from the downstairs windows. The smell of frying eggs and fresh coffee wafts up from the kitchen below.

### Scene 041: Kitchen Overview — Abuela Cooking
**Time:** 6:52 AM — bright kitchen light and morning sun
**Setting:** Kitchen, wide view from doorway
**Description:** The family kitchen is alive with breakfast preparation. It is a modest but cheerful space: yellow walls, white tile countertops, dark wooden cabinets, a gas stove with four burners, a small white refrigerator with magnets and Isabella's drawings held by clips. Abuela stands at the stove, spatula in hand, tending a pan of scrambled eggs. A comal (flat griddle) on the adjacent burner has two round arepas browning on it, their corn surfaces turning golden. On the counter beside the stove: a cutting board with sliced papaya showing its orange flesh and black seeds, a bunch of small sweet bananas, and a pitcher of fresh lulo juice (green-yellow, tropical). A wooden kitchen table with four chairs sits in the center, partially set with plates and cups. A potted aloe vera plant sits on the windowsill. The window above the sink is open, letting in warm Caribbean air and the sound of birds.

### Scene 042: Sebastian at the Table
**Time:** 6:53 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, mid-shot
**Description:** Sebastian, Isabella's 13-year-old brother, already sits at the kitchen table. He is a lanky teenage boy with short dark hair, brown skin, wearing his own school uniform — a white polo shirt and dark blue pants. His larger backpack — navy blue, no decorations, more teenager-appropriate — leans against the table leg beside his chair. He slouches slightly, still looking sleepy, scrolling through something on an old smartphone. His plate is empty, waiting for food. A glass of lulo juice sits in front of him, already poured. He barely looks up as Isabella enters, typical teenage indifference to a younger sibling.

### Scene 043: Isabella Greeting Sebastian
**Time:** 6:54 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, two-shot
**Description:** Isabella slides into her chair at the kitchen table beside Sebastian, bumping his elbow playfully. "Buenos dias, Sebas!" she chirps brightly. He grunts a response without looking up from his phone, then finally glances at her and gives a small half-smile. The dynamic between them is clear — she is the energetic little sister, he is the too-cool-for-this older brother. Isabella's chair has a cushion on it to boost her height at the table. Her place setting has a colorful plastic plate with cartoon animals and a matching cup. Sebastian's has a regular white ceramic plate and glass.

### Scene 044: Abuela Serving Scrambled Eggs
**Time:** 6:56 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, between stove and table
**Description:** Abuela carries the pan from the stove to the table, spooning fluffy scrambled eggs onto each plate with the spatula. She serves Isabella first — a generous mound of yellow eggs with small bits of diced tomato and green onion mixed in, Colombian-style scrambled eggs (huevos pericos). Then Sebastian gets a larger portion. Steam rises from the eggs. "Coman, coman, que se enfria," abuela urges — eat, eat, before it gets cold. She sets the pan back on the stove and turns to the comal on the adjacent burner.

### Scene 045: Abuela Serving Arepas
**Time:** 6:57 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, between stove and table
**Description:** Abuela returns from the stove carrying the comal with a folded cloth protecting her hand from the heat. She slides a golden arepa onto Isabella's plate beside the eggs — round, flat, made of ground corn, its surface slightly crispy with darker spots from the griddle. Then one onto Sebastian's plate. The arepas are warm and fragrant, their corn aroma mixing with the egg steam. Isabella watches eagerly as abuela places a small pat of butter on top of her hot arepa, where it begins to melt immediately, glistening. Abuela sets the comal back on the stove and settles into her own chair with her plate.

### Scene 046: Arepa on the Plate
**Time:** 6:58 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up on Isabella's plate
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's colorful plate with the breakfast now served: a golden-brown arepa — round, flat, made of ground corn, its surface slightly crispy with darker spots from the comal — sits beside the mound of scrambled eggs with tomato and onion. The butter on top of the hot arepa has melted, glistening across the surface. Next to the plate, slices of bright orange papaya are arranged on a small side dish, their black seeds removed. Isabella's cup is filled with lulo juice — a cloudy green-yellow tropical juice. A fork and napkin complete the place setting. The plate's cartoon animal border — parrots, toucans, monkeys — frames the Colombian breakfast.

### Scene 047: Saying Grace
**Time:** 6:59 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, wide view
**Description:** The family bows their heads briefly at the table. Abuela leads a short prayer of thanks: "Bendice Senor estos alimentos..." Isabella's hands are folded in front of her, eyes closed, braids with red ribbons hanging forward over her shoulders. Sebastian's head is bowed but his eyes might be slightly open — a teenager's reluctant participation. Abuela's eyes are closed, hands clasped, lips moving in the familiar words. The breakfast steams on the table between them — eggs, arepas, fruit, juice. The small ceramic crucifix on the kitchen wall is visible behind abuela's head. A brief moment of stillness before the morning energy resumes.

### Scene 048: Taking a Bite of Arepa
**Time:** 7:00 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up on Isabella
**Description:** Isabella picks up her arepa with both hands — it is warm and slightly greasy from the melted butter — and takes a big bite. Her small teeth leave a crescent-shaped mark in the golden corn cake. A few crumbs fall onto her plate. The butter glistens on her lips. She chews with obvious enjoyment, cheeks puffed slightly. The arepa's interior is soft and white, the exterior crispy and golden. Her red ribbon-tipped braids sway as she chews. The scrambled eggs and papaya wait on the plate for their turn.

### Scene 049: Eating Scrambled Eggs
**Time:** 7:03 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, mid-shot
**Description:** Isabella uses her fork to scoop scrambled eggs, lifting them to her mouth. The eggs are fluffy, with visible bits of red tomato and green onion — huevos pericos, a Colombian breakfast staple. She eats with good appetite, alternating between bites of egg and bites of arepa. Some egg falls off the fork back onto the plate. A few crumbs dot the table around her plate. Sebastian across from her eats more quickly, shoveling larger forkfuls. Abuela sips coffee from a small ceramic cup, watching them eat with satisfaction, her own plate of eggs and arepa half-finished.

### Scene 050: Drinking Lulo Juice
**Time:** 7:06 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up on Isabella
**Description:** Isabella lifts her plastic cup of lulo juice with both hands and takes a long drink. The juice is cloudy green-yellow, made from fresh lulo fruit blended with water and a touch of sugar — a quintessential Colombian beverage. She tilts the cup, and the juice level drops visibly. When she sets it down, a faint green-yellow mustache appears on her upper lip. She licks it off with her tongue, then wipes with her napkin the way abuela taught her. The cup is now half-empty. Condensation beads on the outside of the cup in the warm kitchen air.

### Scene 051: Eating Papaya Slices
**Time:** 7:08 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up on side dish
**Description:** Isabella picks up a slice of ripe papaya from the small side dish with her fingers. The fruit is bright orange, soft, and glistening with its own juice. She bites into it, the sweet tropical flesh giving way easily. Juice runs down her chin — papaya is messy. She giggles and catches the drip with her napkin. The papaya's flavor is intensely sweet and fragrant, a Caribbean morning staple. The remaining slices on the dish show the fruit's characteristic orange color. A small black papaya seed clings to one slice, missed in preparation. Isabella picks it off and places it on the edge of her plate.

### Scene 052: Mama Rushing Through Kitchen
**Time:** 7:10 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, wide shot including doorway
**Description:** Mama Patricia sweeps through the kitchen, already dressed for work at the hotel — a neat navy blue skirt, white blouse, low heels, hair pulled back in a professional bun. She is 35, slender, with the same brown skin and dark hair as Isabella. She carries a small purse and a folder of papers. She pauses to kiss Isabella on the top of the head between the braids — "Portate bien, mi amor" (behave yourself, my love) — then kisses Sebastian's head despite his embarrassed dodge. She grabs a small arepa from the counter, wrapping it in a napkin for the road. "Mama, I'm late!" she calls to abuela. A quick kiss on abuela's cheek, and she heads for the front door, heels clicking on the tile. The family watches her whirlwind exit.

### Scene 053: Clearing Isabella's Plate
**Time:** 7:12 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, near sink
**Description:** Isabella carries her plate to the kitchen sink, standing on tiptoe to reach the counter. The plate is mostly clean — she ate well, just a few smears of egg and crumbs remaining. Her plastic cup still has a sip of lulo juice left, which she drains before placing the cup in the sink too. Abuela takes the plate from her, nodding approvingly. "Buena nina," she says — good girl. The kitchen sink is white ceramic, and the window above it frames a view of the small backyard with a clothesline, a potted plant of basil, and a papaya tree with green fruit hanging from its trunk.

### Scene 054: Packing School Bag
**Time:** 7:14 AM — living room morning light
**Setting:** Living room, near front door
**Description:** Isabella kneels on the living room tile floor beside her red backpack, which is covered in cartoon patches — a smiling cat, a rainbow, a star. She opens the main compartment and checks the contents: her math notebook with a blue cover, her Spanish reading notebook with a green cover, her science notebook with a yellow cover, a pencil case decorated with flowers, and a small plastic folder for homework papers. She pulls out the homework she completed yesterday — a sheet of math problems — and checks that it is in the folder. Abuela hands her a small plastic container of sliced watermelon for a school snack, wrapped in a cloth napkin. Isabella tucks it into the front pocket of the backpack. The living room behind her has a worn but comfortable sofa, a small TV on a wooden stand, and more family photos on the wall.

### Scene 055: Zipping Up Backpack
**Time:** 7:17 AM — living room morning light
**Setting:** Living room, close-up on backpack
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's hands zipping the red backpack closed. The zipper pull has a small keychain charm attached — a tiny plastic dolphin, matching her stuffed one upstairs. The cartoon patches on the backpack are visible in detail: the smiling cat has one eye winking, the rainbow arches over a cloud, the star has a face. The backpack is stuffed full, the fabric straining slightly. She lifts it with both hands and swings it onto her back, adjusting the straps over her white uniform shirt. The weight settles onto her small shoulders. She is ready for school.

## PART 4: WALKING TO SCHOOL (7:20 AM - 7:45 AM)

### Scene 056: Saying Goodbye to Abuela at the Door
**Time:** 7:20 AM — bright morning sun, exterior
**Setting:** Front doorway of the house, interior looking out
**Description:** Isabella stands at the front door with her red backpack on, looking up at abuela who stands in the doorway. Abuela bends down and cups Isabella's chin, planting a kiss on her cheek. "Que Dios te bendiga, mi nina," she says — may God bless you, my girl. She makes a small sign of the cross on Isabella's forehead with her thumb. Isabella hugs abuela around the waist tightly. Sebastian is already outside on the front porch, backpack slung over one shoulder, waiting impatiently. The front door is wooden, painted blue, with a small window of frosted glass. The morning sun blazes through the open doorway, silhouetting Isabella's small figure against the bright Cartagena street outside.

### Scene 057: Stepping Out onto the Porch
**Time:** 7:21 AM — bright Caribbean morning sun
**Setting:** Front porch of the house, exterior
**Description:** Isabella steps out onto the small front porch of their house. The house is a two-story structure painted bright yellow with blue trim around the windows and door — classic Cartagena Caribbean style. The porch has a tiled floor, a wrought-iron railing, and two potted plants — a red bougainvillea and a small palm in a clay pot. Sebastian leans against the railing, arms crossed, his navy backpack hanging from one shoulder. The street beyond is narrow, lined with similar colorful houses — pink, orange, green, blue — each with balconies and potted plants. The morning sun is already strong, casting sharp shadows. A neighbor across the street sweeps her front step. The sky is bright blue with a few white tropical clouds.

### Scene 058: Walking Down the Street Together
**Time:** 7:23 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Residential street, viewed from behind the siblings
**Description:** Isabella and Sebastian walk side by side down the narrow residential street. Isabella is small beside her teenage brother — her head barely reaches his shoulder. She wears her complete school uniform: white shirt, navy skirt, white socks, black shoes, braids with red ribbons bouncing as she walks, and the red backpack with cartoon patches. Sebastian walks with the loose, slightly slouched stride of a teenager, his navy backpack on one shoulder. The street is paved with old stone, slightly uneven. Colorful houses line both sides — a turquoise house with a wooden balcony, a coral-pink one with shuttered windows, an orange one with laundry hanging from the second floor. Tropical plants grow in pots and window boxes. A stray cat sits on a doorstep, watching them pass.

### Scene 059: Passing the Corner Tienda
**Time:** 7:26 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Street corner with small shop
**Description:** The siblings pass a corner tienda — a small neighborhood shop with its metal roll-up door raised, shelves visible inside stacked with snacks, drinks, and household goods. A hand-painted sign reads "Tienda Don Jose" in red and blue letters. A cooler full of bottled drinks sits outside the entrance. The shop owner, an older man in a white guayabera shirt, stands in the doorway. He waves at the children — "Buenos dias, ninos!" Isabella waves back cheerfully, braids swinging. Sebastian nods politely. Other children in school uniforms are visible ahead on the street, also walking to school. The sun casts warm light on the colorful storefronts. A mango tree at the corner provides a patch of shade, its branches heavy with green fruit not yet ripe.

### Scene 060: Greeting a Neighbor
**Time:** 7:28 AM — bright morning sun with tree shade patches
**Setting:** Sidewalk, mid-street
**Description:** An elderly woman in a cotton dress sits in a plastic chair on her porch, fanning herself with a folded newspaper even at this early hour. She calls out to Isabella — "Ay, que linda! Esas trenzas quedaron hermosas!" (How pretty! Those braids turned out beautiful!). Isabella stops, smiles widely, and does a little twirl to show off her braids and red ribbons. Sebastian rolls his eyes but waits patiently. The neighbor's house is painted a faded mint green with a wrought-iron balcony above. A small dog — a brown mixed-breed — peers through the porch railing beside the woman's chair. The street is filling with morning activity: a man on a bicycle rides past, a fruit vendor pushes a cart in the distance.

### Scene 061: Crossing a Busier Street
**Time:** 7:30 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Intersection of residential street and main road
**Description:** Isabella and Sebastian reach a busier cross-street. Sebastian extends his arm in front of Isabella protectively, his older-brother instinct kicking in. They wait at the corner as a bus passes — a colorful Cartagena city bus, blue and yellow, packed with passengers. A motorcycle weaves around it. Isabella holds the strap of her backpack tightly, watching the traffic. Sebastian checks both ways, then takes Isabella's hand to cross. She holds on tight, her small hand in his larger one. They cross quickly, shoes hitting the asphalt. On the other side, the school is becoming visible down the block — a two-story white building with a blue gate.

### Scene 062: Other Children Walking to School
**Time:** 7:32 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Street near school, wider view
**Description:** The street near the school is now full of children walking in the same direction, all wearing school uniforms — white shirts and navy bottoms, the girls in skirts, the boys in pants. Small groups of children walk together, chatting and laughing. Some are accompanied by parents or grandparents. Isabella spots her friend Valentina ahead — a girl her age with her hair in a high ponytail with a yellow ribbon — and calls out, "Valen! Esperame!" (Wait for me!). She tugs Sebastian's hand forward, wanting to catch up. The school building grows larger ahead, its blue gate open, a teacher visible at the entrance checking students in.

### Scene 063: Meeting Valentina
**Time:** 7:34 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Sidewalk near school gate
**Description:** Isabella catches up to Valentina and they grab each other's hands, bouncing with excitement as if they haven't seen each other in weeks rather than since yesterday. Valentina is the same height as Isabella, with lighter brown skin, straight dark hair in a high ponytail secured with a yellow ribbon, wearing the same school uniform. They immediately begin chattering — about homework, about what happened on their favorite TV show, about whose ribbons are prettier today. Sebastian has already drifted ahead toward the school gate, joining a group of older boys. Isabella's red backpack bumps against Valentina's purple one as they walk side by side through the stream of arriving students.

### Scene 064: Arriving at the School Gate
**Time:** 7:37 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** School entrance gate, exterior
**Description:** Isabella and Valentina reach the school gate — a tall blue-painted metal gate set in a white concrete wall. A hand-painted sign above reads "Escuela Primaria Republica de Colombia" with the school crest — a shield featuring a book, a sun, and the Colombian flag colors. A female teacher stands at the gate in a light blue blouse and dark skirt, clipboard in hand, greeting students as they enter. "Buenos dias, ninas," she says, checking them off. Students in uniform stream through the gate. Isabella looks up at the school building: two stories, white-washed walls, blue-framed windows, a Colombian flag hanging limply in the still morning air from a pole on the roof. The courtyard inside is visible through the gate — concrete with painted lines, a few trees providing shade.

### Scene 065: Waving Goodbye to Sebastian
**Time:** 7:38 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** Inside school gate, courtyard view
**Description:** Just inside the gate, Isabella turns and waves at Sebastian, who is heading toward the secondary school section on the other side of the building. "Chao, Sebas!" she calls. He raises one hand without turning around — a cool teenager's goodbye. Isabella watches him for a moment, then turns back to Valentina. The school courtyard spreads before them: a large concrete space with painted hopscotch squares on the ground, a covered walkway running along the building, and a few shade trees — a large ceiba tree in one corner with spreading branches. Other children move across the courtyard in groups, uniforms creating a sea of white and navy blue.

### Scene 066: Walking Across the Courtyard
**Time:** 7:40 AM — bright sun with patches of shade from trees
**Setting:** School courtyard, wide view
**Description:** Isabella and Valentina walk across the school courtyard toward their classroom building, weaving between groups of arriving students. Isabella's braids bounce with each step, the red ribbons flashing in the sun. Her red backpack sits squarely on her shoulders. The courtyard is alive with the pre-class buzz: children running, calling to friends, a teacher clapping hands to direct traffic. The flagpole stands in the center of the courtyard, the Colombian flag — yellow, blue, and red stripes — hanging at the top. Painted murals decorate one wall: colorful depictions of Colombian wildlife — a toucan, a jaguar, tropical flowers. A water fountain protrudes from the walkway wall, a line of children already forming at it.

## PART 5: MORNING AT SCHOOL (7:45 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Scene 067: Morning Assembly — Lining Up
**Time:** 7:45 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, flagpole area
**Description:** Students line up in the courtyard by grade for morning assembly. Isabella stands in the fourth-grade line, between Valentina and another classmate, a boy named Diego who is shorter than Isabella with closely cropped hair. Each grade forms a neat row facing the flagpole. Teachers stand at the front of their respective lines. The school principal — a middle-aged woman in a formal dark dress — stands beside the flagpole with a megaphone. Students stand at attention, arms at their sides. Isabella straightens her posture, chin up, the way maestra taught them. The sun beats down on the concrete courtyard. The Colombian flag flutters in a faint breeze.

### Scene 068: Flag Ceremony and National Anthem
**Time:** 7:48 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, focused on flagpole
**Description:** The principal leads the flag ceremony. Two older students — a boy and a girl from the highest grade — stand at the flagpole, one holding the rope. The Colombian flag is raised (or already raised and saluted). All students face the flag, right hands over their hearts. The principal begins the national anthem through the megaphone, and the students join in singing. Isabella mouths the words she knows, her voice mixing with the chorus of hundreds of children. "Oh gloria inmarcesible..." Her hand is flat against her chest, over the school crest on her white shirt. The sun catches the flag's yellow, blue, and red stripes. A flock of Caribbean birds wheels overhead in the bright blue sky.

### Scene 069: Morning Prayer
**Time:** 7:52 AM — bright morning sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, assembly lines
**Description:** After the anthem, the principal leads a brief morning prayer. Students bow their heads, hands clasped in front. Isabella closes her eyes, her dark braids with red ribbons hanging forward. The courtyard is silent except for the principal's voice through the megaphone: "Senor, bendice este dia de aprendizaje..." (Lord, bless this day of learning). A few students fidget — shuffling feet, a whispered word — but most stand still. The ceiba tree's branches provide shade over part of the assembly. A teacher at the end of the fourth-grade line gives a quiet "shh" to a restless student.

### Scene 070: Walking to Classroom
**Time:** 7:55 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Covered walkway along school building
**Description:** Assembly is over, and students disperse to their classrooms. Isabella walks with Valentina along the covered walkway — a concrete path with a corrugated metal roof supported by blue-painted columns. The walkway provides shade from the Caribbean sun. Classroom doors line one side, each numbered with a painted plaque: "4-A," "4-B," "4-C." Student artwork is displayed on the walkway walls between doors — watercolor paintings of flowers, collages about the environment, drawings of Colombian landmarks. Isabella's class is 4-B. The sound of children's shoes — hundreds of them — on the concrete walkway creates a rhythmic shuffle. Isabella's black Mary Janes click softly.

### Scene 071: Entering the Classroom
**Time:** 7:58 AM — bright classroom light through windows
**Setting:** Classroom 4-B doorway, looking in
**Description:** Isabella steps through the doorway into Classroom 4-B. The classroom is a rectangular room with white-washed walls, a tile floor, and large windows along one wall that let in Caribbean sunlight and warm air — no air conditioning, but a ceiling fan turns overhead. About 30 small wooden desks with attached chairs are arranged in five rows of six. A teacher's desk sits at the front, cluttered with papers, a grade book, and a small vase of plastic flowers. Behind the teacher's desk, a green chalkboard spans the wall, with the date written in chalk: the day's date. Above the chalkboard, a crucifix hangs on the wall, and beside it, a framed picture of Simon Bolivar. Educational posters line the walls: the alphabet in bright colors, a multiplication table, a map of Colombia, a diagram of the solar system. Isabella heads toward her desk in the third row.

### Scene 072: Sitting Down at Her Desk
**Time:** 8:00 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, Isabella's desk in third row
**Description:** Isabella arrives at her desk and swings her red backpack off her shoulders, hooking it on the back of the wooden chair. She slides into the seat — the desk is a simple wooden surface with an open shelf underneath for storage. The chair is attached to the desk frame. She scoots forward, her navy skirt smoothing beneath her. The desk surface has faint pencil marks and scratches from years of student use. She opens the desk's storage shelf and pulls out her pencil case — a rectangular fabric case with a flower pattern and a zipper. She places it on the desk beside her closed notebooks. Valentina sits to her left, Diego to her right. The classroom buzzes with the settling noise of 30 fourth-graders finding their seats.

### Scene 073: The Maestra Arrives
**Time:** 8:02 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, front of room
**Description:** The maestra, Senorita Rodriguez, enters the classroom. She is a young woman in her late twenties with dark hair pulled back in a neat bun, wearing a light green blouse, dark skirt, and simple flats. She carries a notebook and a textbook under one arm. She sets them on her desk, turns to the class, and claps her hands twice — the signal for attention. "Buenos dias, ninos y ninas!" The class responds in chorus: "Buenos dias, Senorita Rodriguez!" The chatter dies down. Isabella sits up straight, hands folded on her desk, braids resting on her shoulders. The maestra picks up a piece of white chalk and turns to the chalkboard, writing the day's schedule in neat cursive: "8:00 Matematicas, 9:30 Lectura, 10:15 Recreo, 10:45 Ciencias, 11:30 Ingles."

### Scene 074: Opening the Math Notebook
**Time:** 8:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, close-up on Isabella's desk
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's hands opening her math notebook — the one with the blue cover. The pages are lined, her handwriting filling previous pages: neat rows of numbers, multiplication tables, division problems. She flips to a fresh page and writes today's date at the top in pencil, underlining it with a ruler she pulls from the pencil case. The ruler is clear plastic, 30 centimeters, with a faded cartoon character printed along one edge. The pencil is a standard yellow No. 2 with teeth marks near the eraser — a nervous habit. Her pencil case lies open on the desk, revealing more pencils, an eraser shaped like a strawberry, a small pencil sharpener, and a few colored pencils.

### Scene 075: Math Lesson — Multiplication on the Board
**Time:** 8:10 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, front view toward chalkboard
**Description:** Senorita Rodriguez stands at the chalkboard, chalk in hand, writing multiplication problems in a column: "24 x 3 = ___" and "15 x 6 = ___" and "32 x 4 = ___". She turns to face the class, tapping the chalk on the board. "Remember, we multiply the ones first, then the tens. Who wants to try the first one?" Hands shoot up across the room. Isabella's hand rises eagerly, stretching high, her body lifting slightly from the chair in her enthusiasm. The other students are a mix of eagerness and reluctance — some hands raised, some eyes averted. The ceiling fan casts moving shadows across the chalkboard. The multiplication table poster on the wall serves as a reference for students who need it.

### Scene 076: Isabella Writing Math Problems
**Time:** 8:20 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, close-up on notebook
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's notebook as she works through multiplication problems. Her pencil moves carefully across the lined page, writing numbers in columns. She works on "24 x 3": she writes 24, draws a line beneath, writes x3, then works the problem step by step — "4 times 3 is 12, carry the 1, 2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7" — writing 72 as the answer. She pauses, counts on her fingers briefly to double-check, then nods and moves to the next problem. Her eraser — the strawberry-shaped one — sits ready beside the notebook. A few eraser crumbs litter the page from a previous correction. Her tongue pokes out slightly from the corner of her mouth in concentration.

### Scene 077: Maestra Checking Isabella's Work
**Time:** 8:35 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, at Isabella's desk
**Description:** Senorita Rodriguez walks between the rows of desks, pausing at Isabella's desk. She leans over, looking at Isabella's math notebook. Isabella looks up hopefully. The maestra nods, points to one problem with a smile, and says "Muy bien, Isabella." She makes a small check mark in green pen beside the correct answers. Isabella beams, her brown eyes wide with pride. The maestra moves on to Diego's desk beside her. Isabella glances at her checked work, the green marks a reward. The classroom hum of pencils on paper and quiet murmuring continues around her. Her red backpack hangs from the chair behind her, the cartoon cat patch visible.

### Scene 078: Switching to Reading Class
**Time:** 9:30 AM — bright mid-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, Isabella's desk
**Description:** Isabella closes her math notebook and slides it into the desk storage shelf, pulling out her reading notebook — the one with the green cover — and a thin paperback book. The book is a Colombian children's story, its cover showing a colorful illustration of a girl and a magical heron by a river. The title is in Spanish, the pages slightly dog-eared from reading. She places the book open on her desk and the notebook beside it, ready for the next lesson. Around her, other students make the same transition — the rustle of notebooks and books being exchanged fills the room. Valentina shows Isabella a bookmark she made — a strip of paper with a drawn flower — and Isabella whispers admiringly before the maestra calls for attention.

### Scene 079: Reading Aloud from the Book
**Time:** 9:40 AM — bright mid-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, Isabella standing at her desk
**Description:** Isabella stands beside her desk, holding the open book at chest height, reading a passage aloud. Her voice is clear but slightly nervous — reading aloud in front of the class is both exciting and scary. She follows the text with one finger, sounding out a difficult word: "es-plen-di-do... esplendido!" She smiles when she gets it right. The class listens, most following along in their own copies. Senorita Rodriguez stands near the front, nodding encouragingly. Isabella's braids hang forward as she looks down at the book, the red ribbons bright against the white pages. Her black Mary Jane shoes are planted firmly on the tile floor, a nervous stance.

### Scene 080: Writing in Reading Notebook
**Time:** 9:50 AM — bright mid-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, close-up on desk
**Description:** Isabella writes in her green-covered reading notebook, answering comprehension questions about the story. She writes in careful cursive — still developing, the letters round and sometimes uneven: "La nina fue al rio porque queria encontrar el garzon..." (The girl went to the river because she wanted to find the heron...). She pauses, tapping the pencil eraser against her chin, thinking about the next part of the answer. She glances at the book beside the notebook for reference, flipping back a page. Her pencil lead is getting dull; she reaches for the small sharpener in her pencil case, twists the pencil in it, and a small curl of wood shaving falls on the desk.

### Scene 081: Recess Bell — Excitement
**Time:** 10:15 AM — bright mid-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, wide view
**Description:** A loud electric bell rings through the school. The classroom erupts with energy — children push back from desks, chairs scrape across tile, voices rise. "Recreo!" someone shouts. Senorita Rodriguez calls out over the noise: "Leave your notebooks on the desks!" Isabella springs up from her chair, face lit with excitement. She grabs Valentina's hand. They join the rush of children flowing toward the classroom door. Notebooks and pencils lie abandoned on desks. Backpacks hang from chairs. The ceiling fan spins over the temporarily empty room. Through the windows, the courtyard beckons — bright sun, shade trees, freedom.

### Scene 082: Running into the Courtyard
**Time:** 10:17 AM — bright Caribbean sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, wide view
**Description:** Isabella and Valentina burst through the walkway into the sunlit courtyard, running at full speed. Isabella's braids fly behind her, red ribbons streaming. Her navy skirt flounces with each stride. Other children pour from classrooms all along the walkway, filling the courtyard with movement and noise. The concrete courtyard is large — painted lines mark the hopscotch grid, a faded basketball court outline, and boundaries for various games. The ceiba tree provides a large circle of shade. A group of boys has already claimed a corner for a soccer game with a worn ball. Girls gather in clusters. The sun beats down hot, but no one cares — it is recess, the best part of the school day.

### Scene 083: Jump Rope — Turning the Rope
**Time:** 10:20 AM — bright sun with courtyard shade
**Setting:** School courtyard, near the ceiba tree
**Description:** Isabella and Valentina join three other girls for jump rope near the ceiba tree's shade. Two girls — twins named Lucia and Laura, both with short bobs — hold the ends of a long rope, turning it in a steady arc. Isabella is first to jump in. She times her entry, watching the rope hit the concrete with a rhythmic slap, then leaps in, feet together. She jumps in place, her black shoes leaving the ground and returning, braids bouncing with each hop. The other girls count: "Una, dos, tres, cuatro..." The rope whips around, creating a blur. Isabella's face is pure joy — open-mouthed smile, eyes bright. Sweat already beads on her forehead in the Caribbean heat.

### Scene 084: Jump Rope — Isabella Jumping
**Time:** 10:23 AM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, close-up on jump rope group
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella mid-jump, both feet off the ground, knees slightly bent, braids suspended in air. The rope passes beneath her black shoes. She has been jumping for a while — her cheeks are flushed, breathing quickened, a thin sheen of sweat on her forehead. Her white uniform shirt has come slightly untucked on one side. Valentina stands waiting for her turn, clapping the rhythm. The rope turners maintain their steady pace. Isabella's red ribbon bows bounce with each jump. She tries a trick — crossing her arms while jumping — and nearly trips, but catches herself with a giggle. "Casi!" (Almost!) she laughs. The concrete beneath her shows the scuff marks of hundreds of shoes.

### Scene 085: Playing Tag — Chasing
**Time:** 10:30 AM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, open area
**Description:** Jump rope gives way to tag — "la lleva" in Colombian Spanish. Isabella is "it," chasing Valentina and Diego across the open courtyard. She runs with arms pumping, braids streaming behind her, navy skirt swishing. Her face is fierce with playful determination. She gains on Valentina, who shrieks and dodges left. Other children scatter. The sun pounds the concrete courtyard. Isabella's white socks have slipped down to her ankles from running. Her black shoes slap the ground. She lunges and tags Diego on the shoulder — "Te la llevo!" (You're it!) — and immediately sprints away, laughing. Diego spins and gives chase. The courtyard is a chaos of running, shrieking, laughing children.

### Scene 086: Drinking Water at the Fountain
**Time:** 10:35 AM — bright sun, shade of walkway
**Setting:** School courtyard, water fountain
**Description:** Isabella stands at the water fountain built into the covered walkway wall, leaning down to drink. The fountain is a simple metal fixture with a push button that releases a small arc of cool water. She pushes the button and leans her mouth to the stream, drinking deeply. Water splashes her chin and the front of her white shirt — a small wet spot appears. Her face is flushed from running, sweat glistening on her forehead and temples. Her braids, slightly messier now from play, hang down as she bends. Behind her, Valentina and another girl wait their turn, fanning themselves in the heat. The covered walkway provides welcome shade from the intense Caribbean sun. Isabella straightens, wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, feeling refreshed.

### Scene 087: Snack Time on a Bench
**Time:** 10:38 AM — bright sun with bench in shade
**Setting:** School courtyard, concrete bench under ceiba tree
**Description:** Isabella sits on a concrete bench in the shade of the ceiba tree, opening the front pocket of her red backpack. She pulls out the small plastic container of watermelon that abuela packed. She pries open the lid — inside, bright red watermelon cubes glisten with juice, a few black seeds still embedded. She picks up a cube with her fingers and pops it into her mouth. The fruit is cool and sweet, juice running down her chin. Valentina sits beside her, eating a small bag of plantain chips — a typical Colombian snack. They share bites, Isabella offering a watermelon cube, Valentina extending the chip bag. Their feet swing from the bench, not quite reaching the ground. The ceiba tree's broad leaves filter the sunlight into dappled patterns on the concrete.

### Scene 088: Hopscotch on the Painted Grid
**Time:** 10:42 AM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, hopscotch area
**Description:** Isabella plays hopscotch (rayuela) on the painted grid on the courtyard concrete. The grid is painted in faded but still visible white lines, numbered 1 through 10. She stands at the start, one foot raised, a small flat stone in her hand — the marker. She tosses the stone, and it lands on square 4 with a click. She hops: one foot on 1, one foot on 2, one foot on 3, skips 4, two feet on 5 and 6, one foot on 7, two feet on 8 and 9, one foot on 10. She turns and hops back, bending to pick up the stone on square 4 without putting her other foot down, wobbling slightly. Valentina and two other girls watch, waiting their turns. Isabella's navy skirt sways with each hop.

### Scene 089: End of Recess Bell
**Time:** 10:45 AM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, wide view
**Description:** The electric bell rings again, signaling the end of recess. A collective groan rises from the courtyard. Isabella freezes mid-hop on the hopscotch grid, then jumps to the ground with both feet. "Nooo, ya?" (Already?) she protests, though she knows the routine. Children begin moving back toward the covered walkway and their classrooms, reluctantly, dragging feet. Teachers clap and call: "A clase, ninos! Rapido!" Isabella picks up her red backpack from the bench, Valentina grabs hers, and they walk together toward the walkway, still chattering, not quite ready to give up recess mode. Isabella tucks her slightly untucked shirt back into her skirt as she walks, trying to look presentable for the classroom.

### Scene 090: Science Class — Plants on the Window
**Time:** 10:50 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom 4-B, window area
**Description:** Back in the classroom, Senorita Rodriguez has set up for science class. On the wide windowsill, she has placed three small pots of plants at different growth stages — a sprout just emerging from soil, a small seedling with two leaves, and a taller plant with several leaves. A printed poster on the board shows the parts of a plant: raiz (root), tallo (stem), hojas (leaves), flor (flower). Isabella is at her desk, science notebook open — the one with the yellow cover. She draws the three plants in her notebook, using her colored pencils: brown for the pot and soil, green for the stems and leaves, and a tiny yellow dot for the emerging bud on the tallest plant. She labels each part with arrows and Spanish words, her handwriting careful and rounded.

### Scene 091: Science Class — Writing Observations
**Time:** 11:00 AM — bright late-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, Isabella's desk close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's science notebook as she writes observations about the plants. Her pencil moves across the lined page: "La planta 3 es la mas grande. Tiene 5 hojas verdes y un tallo fuerte..." (Plant 3 is the biggest. It has 5 green leaves and a strong stem...). Beside the writing, her drawing of the plant is detailed and colorful — she has drawn the pot in terracotta brown, the soil dark, the stem bright green with carefully drawn leaf shapes. Colored pencils are scattered on the desk: green, brown, yellow, and light blue (for water drops she added to the drawing). The strawberry eraser has small green smudges on it. Through the window behind her notebook, the bright Caribbean sky and the tops of palm trees are visible.

### Scene 092: English Class — Vocabulary Flashcards
**Time:** 11:30 AM — bright late-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, front of room
**Description:** A different teacher enters for English class — Profesor Martinez, a young man with glasses and a friendly smile, wearing a short-sleeved button-down shirt. He carries a stack of large flashcards. He holds one up: a picture of a house with the word "HOUSE" written in large letters below it. "Repeat after me: HOUSE," he says, pronouncing it carefully. The class choruses: "HOUSE." Some pronunciations are rough — the H is silent in Spanish, so some students say "OUSE." He corrects gently. Isabella mouths the word, trying to get the H sound right, puffing a breath of air before the vowel. The next card shows a dog: "DOG." Isabella's eyes light up — she knows this one. She says it clearly and confidently. The colorful flashcards stack up on the teacher's desk as the lesson progresses: CAT, SCHOOL, BOOK, PENCIL, WATER, FAMILY.

### Scene 093: English Class — Writing English Words
**Time:** 11:45 AM — bright late-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, Isabella's desk
**Description:** Isabella writes English vocabulary words in a dedicated section of her reading notebook. She copies from the chalkboard, where Profesor Martinez has written a list: "house, dog, cat, school, book, pencil, water, family." Beside each word, she writes the Spanish translation: "casa, perro, gato, escuela, libro, lapiz, agua, familia." Her English spelling is careful — she writes slowly, checking each letter against the board. For "pencil," she initially writes "pencl," then erases and corrects it with the strawberry eraser. She draws a tiny picture next to each word as a memory aid — a small house, a tiny dog, a stick-figure cat. Her colored pencils help make the drawings recognizable. Valentina leans over to peek at Isabella's drawings and whispers "Que bonitos" (How pretty).

### Scene 094: Pre-Lunch Packing Up
**Time:** 11:55 AM — bright late-morning light
**Setting:** Classroom, Isabella's desk
**Description:** The class period is ending. Profesor Martinez says "Goodbye, students! Practice your words at home." The class responds in unison: "Goodbye, Profesor Martinez!" Isabella places her pencils back in the flower-patterned pencil case, zipping it closed. She stacks her notebooks neatly — blue math, green reading, yellow science — and slides them into the desk storage shelf. The classroom is getting restless with hunger as lunchtime approaches. Isabella's stomach growls audibly, and Valentina giggles. Isabella pats her stomach and grins. She pulls her chair in neatly and waits for the maestra's signal to line up for the cafeteria.

## PART 6: LUNCH AT SCHOOL (12:00 PM - 12:30 PM)

### Scene 095: Lining Up for the Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:00 PM — bright midday sun on walkway
**Setting:** Covered walkway outside classroom
**Description:** Senorita Rodriguez has the students line up in two rows outside the classroom door before walking to the cafeteria. Isabella stands in line with Valentina directly behind her. The covered walkway provides shade from the midday Caribbean sun, which blazes on the courtyard beyond. The line of 30 fourth-graders in white shirts and navy bottoms stretches down the walkway. Some children hold their stomachs dramatically, performing hunger. The maestra leads them forward in an orderly shuffle, though the line wobbles as children chat and bump into each other. The hot midday air carries the smell of cooked rice from the cafeteria at the end of the walkway.

### Scene 096: Entering the Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:03 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** School cafeteria entrance
**Description:** Isabella enters the school cafeteria — a large, open-sided room with a corrugated metal roof, concrete floor, and long metal tables with attached benches. The space is partially open to the outdoors on two sides, letting in air to combat the midday heat. Ceiling fans turn overhead. A serving counter runs along one wall, where cafeteria workers — women in white aprons and hairnets — stand behind large metal pots. A hand-painted sign on the wall reads "Almuerzo" (Lunch) with a painted plate of food. The room is already filling with students from other grades, the noise level rising with chatter and the clatter of trays. Isabella picks up a plastic tray from a stack at the entrance — the trays are faded orange, well-used but clean.

### Scene 097: Moving Through the Serving Line
**Time:** 12:05 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Cafeteria serving counter
**Description:** Isabella slides her orange tray along the metal counter as cafeteria workers serve each item. A woman with a kind face and a large serving spoon ladles white rice onto the tray — a generous mound. The next worker adds a piece of grilled chicken (pollo asado), golden-brown and fragrant. Then a spoonful of cooked red beans (frijoles). Then a small portion of sliced cucumber and tomato salad with a sprinkle of lime juice. Finally, a small carton of boxed fruit juice — mango flavor — is placed on the tray's corner. Isabella says "Gracias, senora" to each worker as she receives food. The tray grows heavier as she moves along, her small hands gripping both sides carefully. Steam rises from the rice and chicken.

### Scene 098: Finding a Seat
**Time:** 12:08 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Cafeteria, long metal table
**Description:** Isabella carries her loaded tray carefully to a long metal table, navigating between other students. She slides onto the metal bench seat, placing her tray in front of her. Valentina sits down beside her, tray clinking against the metal table. Other classmates fill in — Diego across from them, a girl named Camila beside Diego. The bench is hard metal, the table surface scratched and dented from years of use. Isabella's tray holds the mound of white rice, the piece of golden chicken, red beans, the small salad, and the mango juice box. The cafeteria noise is a roar of children talking, trays clattering, benches scraping concrete.

### Scene 099: Eating Rice and Chicken
**Time:** 12:12 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Cafeteria table, close-up on Isabella
**Description:** Isabella uses her fork to combine rice and beans in a bite — the Colombian way, mixing them together. She lifts the fork to her mouth and chews. The rice is warm and slightly sticky, the beans soft and seasoned. She then cuts a piece of the grilled chicken with her fork — the meat is tender, pulling apart easily. She dips the chicken piece in the bean sauce before eating it. Her braids hang forward as she looks down at her tray, the red ribbons resting on the metal table surface. She eats steadily, hungry from the morning of classes and recess. Valentina beside her picks at the salad first, a different eating strategy. The mango juice box sits untouched, saved for the end.

### Scene 100: Chatting with Friends at Lunch
**Time:** 12:18 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Cafeteria table, group shot
**Description:** The lunch table is alive with conversation. Isabella talks with her mouth half-full — abuela would scold her — telling Valentina about a drawing she wants to make after school. Diego across the table makes a funny face with cucumber slices over his eyes, and the girls laugh. Camila shares a piece of gossip about a fifth-grader. The food on Isabella's tray is half-eaten now: the chicken is gone, rice and beans remain, the salad is mostly untouched (vegetables are not her favorite). Trays clatter, juice boxes are punctured with straws. The cafeteria is at full volume — hundreds of children eating and talking at once. A teacher patrol walks between tables, maintaining order.

### Scene 101: Drinking Juice Box
**Time:** 12:22 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Cafeteria table, close-up
**Description:** Isabella peels the plastic straw from the side of her mango juice box and unwraps it. She pokes the sharp end through the foil hole on top of the box — it takes two tries, the foil resisting the first attempt. She lifts the small box to her mouth and sips. The mango juice is sweet and thick, room temperature from sitting on the tray. She squeezes the box slightly to get more flow. The juice box is small — designed for children — with a colorful label showing a cartoon mango character. She drinks it steadily, the box collapsing inward as she empties it. Valentina is already finished with hers, the flat box discarded on her tray.

### Scene 102: Returning Tray
**Time:** 12:27 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Cafeteria, return area
**Description:** Isabella stands and carries her tray to the return area — a window in the wall where used trays are stacked on a metal shelf. She scrapes the remaining rice and untouched salad into a large plastic waste bin with a rubber spatula provided for the purpose. The empty tray goes onto the stack with a clatter. She wipes her hands on a paper napkin from a dispenser on the wall, crumples it, and tosses it in the trash can. Her uniform shirt has a tiny spot of bean sauce near the second button — a lunch casualty. She brushes at it with a wet napkin but it doesn't come out entirely. She shrugs and rejoins Valentina, who is already heading back toward the walkway.

---

## PART 5: LUNCH RECESS (12:30 PM - 1:00 PM)

### Scene 103: Running to the Courtyard After Lunch
**Time:** 12:30 PM — bright midday sun, partial shade from trees
**Setting:** School courtyard, wide shot from building edge
**Description:** Isabella and Valentina burst through the cafeteria doors into the bright courtyard, the midday Cartagena sun hitting them immediately. The courtyard is alive with children — running, shouting, playing. Isabella squints in the glare, her braids bouncing as she jogs across the concrete toward the shaded area under the large mango tree. Her white uniform shirt has come slightly untucked on one side. Valentina follows, her own braids swinging. Other fourth-graders are already claiming spots — the swings, the concrete benches, the open area for ball games. The sun is directly overhead, casting almost no shadows except under the trees.

### Scene 104: Playing on the Swings
**Time:** 12:33 PM — bright overhead sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, swing set area
**Description:** Isabella sits on a metal swing, gripping the warm chains with both small hands. She pumps her legs — forward, back, forward, back — gaining height. Her navy blue skirt flutters. Her braids stream behind her at the peak of each forward swing. Valentina swings beside her, and they try to synchronize, laughing when they get it right. The swing chains creak rhythmically. Other children wait their turn, calling "¡Apúrense!" — hurry up. The metal swing frame is painted blue but chipped, showing rust beneath. The ground below is packed dirt, worn smooth by hundreds of dragging feet.

### Scene 105: Jumping Off the Swing
**Time:** 12:38 PM — bright midday sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, swing area
**Description:** At the peak of a forward swing, Isabella lets go of the chains and launches herself into the air — a moment of flight, braids suspended, arms spread wide. She lands on both feet in the packed dirt, stumbling forward a step but staying upright. She throws her arms up in triumph. Valentina claps. A small cloud of dust rises from the landing spot. Isabella's black shoes are now coated in light brown dust. A teacher on courtyard duty glances over but doesn't intervene — this is normal recess daring. Isabella brushes off her skirt, grinning.

### Scene 106: Jump Rope with Friends
**Time:** 12:42 PM — bright sun, dappled shade
**Setting:** School courtyard, under tree canopy
**Description:** A group of girls has organized a jump rope game under the mango tree's shade. Two girls turn a long rope — it whips against the concrete in a steady rhythm. Isabella waits for the right beat, then dashes in, her feet hopping over the rope as it passes under. The girls chant a rhyme in Spanish — "Soy la reina de los mares..." — the words keeping time with the rope. Isabella's braids bounce with each jump, the red ribbons flashing. She manages twelve jumps before the rope catches her ankle and she stumbles out, laughing. The next girl dashes in. Dappled sunlight through the mango leaves creates shifting patterns on the concrete.

### Scene 107: Drinking from the Water Fountain
**Time:** 12:48 PM — bright sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, near building wall
**Description:** Isabella leans over the metal water fountain mounted on the school building's exterior wall. She presses the chrome button and a thin arc of water rises. She slurps at it, water splashing her chin. The water is lukewarm from the sun-heated pipes — not refreshing but necessary. Her face is flushed and damp with sweat from the jump rope. Other children queue behind her, jostling impatiently. She takes a few more gulps, wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, and steps aside. Her white uniform shirt clings slightly to her back with perspiration. The Cartagena midday heat is relentless.

### Scene 108: Sitting in the Shade Chatting
**Time:** 12:52 PM — dappled shade under tree
**Setting:** School courtyard, under mango tree on concrete bench
**Description:** Isabella and Valentina sit on a concrete bench in the shade of the mango tree, catching their breath. Their legs dangle, not quite reaching the ground. They talk about after-school plans — Isabella wants to draw a parrot she saw on the way to school. Valentina is going to her cousin's house. A green and yellow mango hangs from a branch above them, not yet ripe. Isabella points at it and they speculate about when it will fall. A breeze stirs the leaves, providing a moment of relief from the heat. Their faces are shiny with sweat, braids slightly loosened from play.

### Scene 109: Bell Ringing — End of Recess
**Time:** 1:00 PM — bright midday sun
**Setting:** School courtyard, wide shot
**Description:** A loud electric bell sounds from the building, cutting through the courtyard noise. Children groan collectively — recess is over. Isabella and Valentina stand from the bench and join the stream of students flowing back toward the building entrance. Teachers stand at doorways directing traffic. Isabella tugs at her uniform, trying to tuck the shirt back in as she walks. Her shoes are dusty, her braids slightly disheveled, her cheeks flushed. The bright courtyard empties rapidly, the sounds shifting from shouts and laughter to shuffling feet and murmured conversations as students re-enter the building.

---

## PART 6: AFTERNOON CLASSES (1:00 PM - 1:15 PM)

### Scene 110: Returning to the Classroom
**Time:** 1:03 PM — indoor fluorescent light
**Setting:** Classroom, from rear entrance
**Description:** Isabella walks back into the classroom, sliding into her wooden desk-chair. The room feels warm after being closed during lunch — the overhead fans are on but the air is still heavy. She pulls her pencil case and notebook from inside the desk compartment. Other students file in, some still chewing gum they'll have to spit out when the teacher notices. The chalkboard has been erased, a fresh green surface. Señora García enters behind the last students, carrying a stack of papers and a geography textbook. "Buenas tardes, niños." "¡Buenas tardes, Señora García!" the class responds.

### Scene 111: Geography Lesson — Map of Colombia
**Time:** 1:06 PM — fluorescent light with afternoon sun through windows
**Setting:** Classroom, facing chalkboard
**Description:** Señora García has pulled down a large laminated wall map of Colombia over the chalkboard. She points to different regions with a wooden pointer. "¿Quién me dice dónde queda Cartagena?" Isabella's hand shoots up — she knows this one. Señora García nods, and Isabella stands to point at the Caribbean coast. "¡Muy bien!" The map shows Colombia in greens and browns — the Andes mountain ranges, the Amazon region, the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Red dots mark major cities. Isabella traces the coastline with her eyes, finding Cartagena's dot. The pointer casts a thin shadow across the map.

### Scene 112: Coloring the Map Worksheet
**Time:** 1:10 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at Isabella's desk, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's desk where she works on a worksheet — a blank outline map of Colombia that she must color by region. She holds a blue colored pencil, carefully filling in the Caribbean coast region. Her tongue peeks out from the corner of her mouth in concentration — a habit when she focuses. The pencil case is open beside the worksheet, colored pencils fanned out. She's already colored the Pacific coast green and the Andes region brown. Her small hand moves in careful strokes, trying to stay within the lines. A few pencil shavings litter the desk surface.

### Scene 113: Writing in Notebook
**Time:** 1:15 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at desk
**Description:** Isabella copies notes from the chalkboard into her notebook. Señora García has written the names of Colombia's major rivers and their regions. Isabella writes in careful cursive — they're learning cursive this year and her letters are round and slightly wobbly. "Río Magdalena — región Andina." She pauses to check the spelling on the board, squinting slightly. Her pencil is getting short — she'll need to sharpen it soon. Valentina beside her is further behind, still coloring the map. The classroom has settled into the quiet hum of students working.

### Scene 114: Pencil Sharpening
**Time:** 1:20 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at pencil sharpener by window
**Description:** Isabella walks to the small wall-mounted pencil sharpener near the window, holding her short pencil. She inserts it and turns the crank, the sharpener grinding with a satisfying crunching sound. Wood shavings curl and fall into the small transparent collection box below. She tests the point against her fingertip — sharp enough — and walks back to her desk. Through the window beside the sharpener, she can see the empty courtyard baking in the afternoon sun, heat shimmering off the concrete. She's glad to be inside now.

---

## PART 7: END OF SCHOOL DAY (1:25 PM - 1:50 PM)

### Scene 115: Final Bell Ringing
**Time:** 1:25 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, wide shot
**Description:** The final bell of the school day rings — a long sustained buzz from the speaker mounted above the chalkboard. The class erupts in noise. Students slam notebooks closed, shove pencil cases into backpacks, chair legs scrape against the tile floor. Señora García raises her hand for quiet. "¡Un momento! Tarea para mañana — página cuarenta y tres, ejercicios uno al cinco." Isabella scribbles the homework assignment on the back of her hand with a pen — a habit abuela disapproves of. She zips her red backpack, slings it over both shoulders, and stands. The classroom buzzes with freedom energy.

### Scene 116: Lining Up at the Door
**Time:** 1:27 PM — indoor light
**Setting:** Classroom doorway, from inside
**Description:** Señora García insists the class line up at the door before dismissal — an orderly exit, not a stampede. Isabella stands in line behind Valentina, backpack heavy on her shoulders. The children fidget, whisper, poke each other. Señora García gives them a final look, nods, and waves them out. "Hasta mañana, niños. ¡Que Dios los bendiga!" The line dissolves the moment it crosses the threshold, children scattering in every direction down the hallway. Isabella grabs Valentina's hand and they walk together toward the school gate.

### Scene 117: Meeting Sebastian at the School Gate
**Time:** 1:30 PM — bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** School front gate, from outside looking in
**Description:** Isabella exits through the tall metal school gate and finds her older brother Sebastian, 13, waiting under the shade of a tree just outside. He's in his own school uniform — white shirt, dark pants (the secondary school wing gets out at the same time). He's tall and lanky, dark curly hair cut shorter than Isabella's, earbuds around his neck. "¡Vámonos!" — Let's go! — he says, barely looking up from his phone. Isabella waves goodbye to Valentina, who is heading the opposite direction with her mother. The street in front of the school is chaotic — parents on motorcycles, school vans, walking families, ice cream vendors taking advantage of the crowd.

### Scene 118: Walking Home — Cartagena Street
**Time:** 1:33 PM — bright harsh afternoon sun
**Setting:** Cartagena neighborhood street, viewed from ahead
**Description:** Isabella and Sebastian walk along a narrow Cartagena street, the afternoon sun beating down. The buildings are two and three stories, painted in the faded pastels typical of Cartagena — yellow, turquoise, pink, orange — with wooden balconies and heavy wooden doors. Laundry hangs from upper windows. Isabella walks slightly behind Sebastian, her backpack bouncing. She hops over cracks in the uneven sidewalk, making a game of it. Sebastian walks with teenage nonchalance, earbuds in now, head bobbing to music. A motorcycle buzzes past. A woman sells fruit from a cart — sliced mango with lime and salt in plastic bags. The air is hot and heavy.

### Scene 119: Passing the Fruit Vendor
**Time:** 1:36 PM — bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Cartagena street, at vendor cart
**Description:** Isabella tugs Sebastian's arm and points at the fruit vendor's cart — a wooden cart with a colorful umbrella, displaying cut mangoes, pineapple, watermelon, and papaya in plastic bags. "¡Mango, Sebas, por favor!" Sebastian shakes his head — "No tengo plata" — no money. Isabella pouts briefly but keeps walking. She looks back at the cart longingly. The vendor, a dark-skinned woman in a wide straw hat, waves at the children with a friendly smile. The bags of mango are golden-orange, dusted with salt and a squeeze of lime. The smell is sweet and tangy.

### Scene 120: Arriving at Their Street
**Time:** 1:40 PM — bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Residential street, approaching house
**Description:** Isabella and Sebastian turn onto their residential street — a quieter road with two-story houses painted in cheerful colors, small front gardens or patios behind wrought-iron fences, potted plants on windowsills. Their house is mid-block — a two-story structure painted a warm coral color with white trim around the windows and a turquoise front door. A wrought-iron gate leads to a small tiled patio with potted bougainvillea in hot pink. Isabella breaks into a run as they approach, backpack thumping. Sebastian calls after her, "¡No corras con la maleta!" — Don't run with the backpack!

---

## PART 8: AFTERNOON AT HOME (1:40 PM - 5:15 PM)

### Scene 121: Abuela on the Porch
**Time:** 1:42 PM — bright afternoon sun, porch shade
**Setting:** House front porch, viewed from street
**Description:** Abuela Doña Mercedes sits in a wooden rocking chair on the small front porch, fanning herself with a folded newspaper. She wears a light cotton house dress in yellow with white flowers and simple house slippers. A glass of lemonade sweats on the small table beside her. She spots Isabella running toward the gate and her weathered face breaks into a wide smile, crow's feet deepening around her dark eyes. Her silver-streaked hair is pulled back in its usual loose bun. "¡Mi niña hermosa!" she calls, standing to receive the incoming hug. The bougainvillea frames the porch in vivid pink.

### Scene 122: Hugging Abuela
**Time:** 1:43 PM — porch shade
**Setting:** House front porch, close-up
**Description:** Isabella crashes into Abuela's embrace, arms wrapping around her grandmother's waist. Abuela bends to kiss the top of Isabella's head, smoothing a loose curl. "¿Cómo te fue en el colegio, mi amor?" — How was school? Isabella launches into a rapid-fire summary — Señora García was nice, she learned about rivers, the lunch was good, she scored in jump rope. Abuela listens, nodding, asking follow-up questions with genuine interest. Sebastian passes behind them with a muttered "Hola, Abue" and disappears inside. The afternoon heat presses in, but the porch shade and the overhead fan create a pocket of bearable air.

### Scene 123: Dropping Backpack Inside
**Time:** 1:45 PM — cool interior light
**Setting:** House entryway/living room, from doorway
**Description:** Isabella enters the house through the turquoise front door, the interior immediately cooler — thick walls and tile floors keep the heat at bay. She drops her red backpack on the tile floor near the entrance with a thud, the cartoon patches facing up. Abuela follows, tutting — "¡Eso no se deja ahí!" — Don't leave that there! Isabella picks it up sheepishly and moves it to a hook on the wall near the door, beside Sebastian's darker backpack. The living room is visible beyond: a tiled floor, a worn but comfortable couch with bright cushion covers, a wooden coffee table, a TV on a stand, family photos on the walls, and a ceiling fan turning overhead.

### Scene 124: Changing Out of School Uniform
**Time:** 1:48 PM — bedroom light, afternoon sun through curtains
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, medium shot
**Description:** Isabella pulls her white uniform shirt over her head and drops it on the bed. She steps out of the navy skirt and drapes it over the wooden chair — mama's rule: hang the uniform, don't ball it up. She opens the small wooden wardrobe and selects her home clothes: a bright pink t-shirt with a sequined heart design on the front and a pair of cotton shorts, light blue with small white flowers. She pulls them on quickly, the freedom of casual clothes visible in her relaxed posture. Her black school shoes come off and she kicks them under the bed, sliding her feet into the pink rubber flip-flops. She's a different person now — school Isabella has become home Isabella.

### Scene 125: Untying Braids
**Time:** 1:51 PM — bedroom light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at small mirror
**Description:** Isabella stands before the small mirror on her desk, pulling the red ribbons from her braids. She undoes the braids carefully, wincing at a few tangles. Her long dark curly hair springs free, expanding into a wild cloud around her face and shoulders. She runs her fingers through it, shaking her head to let it settle. The red ribbons sit coiled on the desk beside her pencil tin. She looks at her reflection — flushed cheeks, bean sauce stain still visible on the discarded uniform shirt, free hair. After-school Isabella stares back at her, ready for the afternoon.

### Scene 126: Walking to the Kitchen for Snack
**Time:** 1:55 PM — cool interior, kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, viewed from hallway
**Description:** Isabella walks barefoot into the kitchen — her flip-flops abandoned in the bedroom. The kitchen is the heart of the house: colorful hand-painted tiles on the backsplash (blue, orange, yellow patterns), a gas stove with two burners, a compact refrigerator humming in the corner, open shelves with plates and glasses, and a small wooden table with four chairs. Abuela is already there, setting out Isabella's afternoon snack (onces) on the table. The kitchen smells of something warm — Abuela has been cooking while Isabella was at school. A pot simmers on the back burner, covered with a lid.

### Scene 127: Eating Afternoon Snack — Empanada
**Time:** 2:00 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Isabella sits at the kitchen table, bare feet swinging above the tile floor. Before her: a small plate with a golden-fried empanada — crescent-shaped, the corn dough shell crispy, filled with seasoned potato and meat (ají sauce on the side in a tiny dish). Beside it, a tall glass of cold lulo juice — pale green, slightly frothy. Isabella picks up the empanada with both hands and takes a big bite. The crust shatters, flakes falling on the plate. The filling is warm and savory. She chews with obvious pleasure, eyes half-closed. Abuela sits across from her with a cup of dark coffee (tinto), watching her granddaughter eat with that particular satisfaction grandmothers have.

### Scene 128: Telling Abuela About School
**Time:** 2:05 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, two shot
**Description:** Between bites of empanada and sips of lulo juice, Isabella tells Abuela about the geography lesson. She describes the map of Colombia, counting the regions on her fingers. Abuela nods, adding her own knowledge — "Your grandfather was from the Andes, near Boyacá." Isabella's eyes widen; she didn't know this. Abuela tells a brief story about grandfather's village. The empanada is half-eaten now, the juice leaving a pale green ring on the glass. The kitchen fan turns overhead. Sebastian passes through, grabbing a banana from the counter, and disappears again. The grandmother and granddaughter exist in their own warm bubble of story and food.

### Scene 129: Finishing Snack and Washing Hands
**Time:** 2:15 PM — kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Isabella carries her empty plate and glass to the kitchen sink, standing on tiptoes to reach. She washes her hands under the faucet, the water splashing. Abuela takes the plate and washes it. Isabella dries her hands on the kitchen towel — a colorful cloth with a rooster design hanging from a hook near the stove. Her face has a sheen of empanada oil near her mouth; Abuela reaches over and wipes it with her thumb. "Ahora las tareas," Abuela says — now homework. Isabella's shoulders sag dramatically. Homework is the price of the afternoon snack.

### Scene 130: Setting Up Homework at the Coffee Table
**Time:** 2:25 PM — warm living room light, afternoon sun through curtains
**Setting:** Living room, at coffee table
**Description:** Isabella sits on the tile floor at the wooden coffee table, legs crossed underneath her. She unzips her red backpack and pulls out her math notebook, her geography notebook, and her pencil case. The pencil case — pink with cartoon cats — spills colored pencils and erasers when she opens it. She arranges her workspace: math notebook open, pencil sharpened, eraser ready. Abuela settles into the couch behind her with a ball of yarn and knitting needles — she's making something in pale blue. The living room is quiet except for the ceiling fan's hum and the distant sound of a radio from a neighbor's house.

### Scene 131: Doing Math Homework
**Time:** 2:30 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, close-up on notebook
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's notebook and her small hand working a multiplication problem. The worksheet heading reads "Multiplicación — Tabla del 7." She writes "7 × 4 =" and pauses, counting on her fingers under the table where Abuela can't see. Her lips move silently: "siete, catorce, veintiuno, veintiocho." She writes "28" and moves to the next problem. Her handwriting is round and large, filling the grid squares. The eraser has already been used twice — gray smudges mark corrected answers. Her brow furrows with concentration, the curly hair falling forward. Math is not her favorite — she'd rather be drawing.

### Scene 132: Asking Abuela for Help
**Time:** 2:45 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, two shot
**Description:** Isabella turns to Abuela on the couch, holding up her notebook. "Abue, ¿siete por ocho?" Abuela sets down her knitting and leans forward, reading glasses perched on her nose. "A ver... piensa, mi amor. Siete por siete es cuarenta y nueve, ¿verdad? Entonces siete por ocho es siete más." Isabella counts from forty-nine, adding seven. "¡Cincuenta y seis!" Abuela smiles and nods. "¡Eso es!" Isabella writes the answer proudly. Abuela doesn't give answers directly — she guides. Her reading glasses catch the light from the window. The knitting needles rest in her lap, the pale blue yarn trailing.

### Scene 133: Geography Homework — Writing Rivers
**Time:** 3:00 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, at coffee table
**Description:** Isabella switches to her geography notebook, copying the list of Colombian rivers and their regions from the notes she took in class. She writes carefully: "Río Magdalena — Región Andina. Río Cauca — Región Andina. Río Amazonas — Región Amazónica." She checks the homework assignment written on the back of her hand (now slightly smudged) — page 43, exercises 1 through 5. Exercise 3 asks her to draw a river on a map. She perks up — drawing! She reaches for the colored pencils, selecting a blue one to trace the Magdalena River's path.

### Scene 134: Drawing the River on the Map
**Time:** 3:10 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, close-up on notebook
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's geography notebook where she draws the Magdalena River in blue pencil on a simplified outline map of Colombia. Her line is slightly wobbly but follows the river's general course from south to north. She adds a small label: "Río Magdalena" in her round cursive. She adds tiny blue lines for tributaries — probably more artistic than geographically accurate. She's enjoying this — the drawing part of homework is always better than the math part. The blue pencil tip is wearing down. Colored pencil shavings litter the coffee table surface.

### Scene 135: Closing the Notebooks — Homework Done
**Time:** 3:25 PM — warm golden afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, medium shot
**Description:** Isabella stacks her notebooks, tucks the pencils back in the cat pencil case, and zips everything into her backpack. She stretches her arms overhead with a satisfied sigh. "¡Listo, Abue! ¡Terminé!" — Done! Abuela looks up from her knitting and nods approvingly. "Muy bien, mi amor. Ahora puedes jugar." — Now you can play. Isabella springs to her feet, the transition from homework posture to play energy instantaneous. She's already heading for her bedroom. The coffee table is clear again, only faint pencil dust marking where she worked. The afternoon light through the curtains has shifted to a warmer gold.

### Scene 136: Playing with Dolls — Setting Up
**Time:** 3:30 PM — warm golden bedroom light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, floor level
**Description:** Isabella sits on the tile floor of her bedroom, surrounded by her doll collection. A small wooden dollhouse — painted pink with a green roof, open on one side to show two floors — sits against the wall. She arranges five dolls of various sizes near it: two are in dresses, one in overalls, one is a baby doll in a blanket. A small tea set — plastic, purple and pink, with tiny cups, a teapot, and saucers — is pulled from a box under the bed. She begins setting up a scene, talking in different voices for each doll. The stuffed teddy bear and plush dolphin watch from the bed. Afternoon light streams through the window, casting warm rectangles on the floor.

### Scene 137: Tea Party with Dolls
**Time:** 3:45 PM — golden afternoon light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, floor level close-up
**Description:** Close-up of the tea party arrangement. The dolls are seated around the small plastic tea set in a semicircle on the tile floor. Isabella "pours" tea from the plastic teapot into each tiny cup with exaggerated formality. "¿Azúcar, señora?" she asks one doll in a high-pitched voice, then answers in a deeper voice: "Sí, dos cucharadas, por favor." She pretends to add sugar, stirring with her pinky extended. The teddy bear has been dragged from the bed to join — he gets the largest cup. Isabella is fully immersed in her imagination, the real world forgotten. Her curly hair falls loose around her face as she bends over the tiny table.

### Scene 138: Drawing at Her Desk
**Time:** 4:00 PM — warm golden light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Isabella has moved to her small wooden desk, sketchbook open, colored pencils spread across the surface. She's drawing the parrot she saw this morning on the walk to school — a green body with red and blue wing feathers, a curved yellow beak. Her hand moves confidently with the pencils — drawing is her favorite thing. The parrot takes shape on the white page, slightly cartoonish but full of color and life. She adds a branch for it to sit on, then a few leaves. The tin cup on the desk holds the rest of her colored pencils, upright like a bouquet. The bedroom is quiet, the ceiling fan turning, the only sound the scratch of pencil on paper.

### Scene 139: Showing Abuela the Drawing
**Time:** 4:15 PM — warm golden light
**Setting:** Living room, at couch
**Description:** Isabella runs to the living room, sketchbook held up proudly. "¡Mira, Abue! ¡El loro que vi hoy!" — Look, the parrot I saw today! Abuela sets down her knitting and takes the sketchbook, holding it at arm's length — her reading glasses are on the coffee table. She studies the drawing, turning it slightly. "¡Qué lindo, mi amor! Tienes manos de artista." — How lovely, you have artist's hands. Isabella beams. Abuela points at the colors — "Just like the ones that come to the mango tree." They discuss parrots for a moment. Isabella takes the sketchbook back and heads to the desk to add more details, inspired by Abuela's praise.

### Scene 140: Watching Cartoons on TV
**Time:** 4:30 PM — dimmer living room, TV glow
**Setting:** Living room, on couch
**Description:** Isabella lies on the living room couch on her stomach, chin propped on a cushion, bare feet kicking lazily in the air. The TV shows a colorful animated series — bright characters in an adventure story. She watches with wide eyes, occasionally giggling. Her curly hair fans across the cushion. The remote control sits on the coffee table within reach. Abuela works in the kitchen now, the sounds of pots and a running faucet drifting through the house. Sebastian's bedroom door is closed — music faintly audible from behind it. The living room is cooler now as the afternoon begins its slow slide toward evening.

### Scene 141: Laughing at a Cartoon Scene
**Time:** 4:40 PM — TV glow and warm light
**Setting:** Living room, close-up on face
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's face illuminated by the TV screen. She laughs — a real, full laugh that scrunches her nose and shows her teeth (one front tooth is slightly bigger than the other). Her brown eyes reflect the cartoon's bright colors. She pulls the cushion tighter, still laughing. The animated character on screen has apparently done something very funny. She rolls onto her side, kicking her feet, the laugh dissolving into giggles. A simple, pure moment of childhood joy. The ceiling fan's shadow sweeps rhythmically across the ceiling above her.

### Scene 142: Hearing Mama Arrive
**Time:** 5:15 PM — warm late afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, at front door
**Description:** The sound of the front gate creaking open makes Isabella sit bolt upright on the couch. "¡Mami!" She leaps off the couch and runs to the turquoise front door, pulling it open. Mama Patricia stands in the patio, still in her hotel uniform — a dark skirt, cream blouse, name tag, low heels — looking tired but smiling. She's 35, with the same dark curly hair as Isabella, pulled back in a professional bun. She carries a purse and a plastic bag with something she picked up on the way home. Isabella crashes into her for a hug, arms around her waist. "¡Te extrañé, mami!" — I missed you!

### Scene 143: Mama Greeting Everyone
**Time:** 5:17 PM — warm late afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room/kitchen, medium shot
**Description:** Mama Patricia enters the house, Isabella still clinging to her hand. She kisses Abuela on the cheek — "Hola, Mamá, ¿cómo estuvo todo?" She pokes her head into Sebastian's room to say hello (he grunts from behind his phone). She sets the plastic bag on the kitchen counter — a loaf of bread from the bakery near her hotel. She kicks off her low heels with a sigh of relief, her stocking feet on the cool tile. "¿Ya hicieron las tareas?" — Did you all do your homework? Isabella nods enthusiastically. Abuela confirms. Mama changes the subject to dinner plans — Abuela has been cooking.

### Scene 144: Mama Changing Clothes
**Time:** 5:25 PM — bedroom light
**Setting:** Mama's bedroom (glimpsed from hallway)
**Description:** Through the partially open doorway, Isabella watches Mama change from her hotel uniform into comfortable home clothes — loose cotton pants and a tank top. Mama unclips her hair, letting the dark curls fall to her shoulders — she and Isabella have the same hair. Isabella sits on the hallway floor, chattering about her day — the geography map, the jump rope record, the bean stain on her uniform. Mama listens from inside the room, responding with "¿De verdad?" and "¡Qué bien!" Isabella talks and talks, the day's stories pouring out now that her primary audience has arrived home.

## PART 9: DINNER PREPARATION AND FAMILY DINNER (5:45 PM - 7:00 PM)

### Scene 145: Helping Abuela Set the Table
**Time:** 5:45 PM — warm evening light, kitchen light
**Setting:** Dining area adjacent to kitchen
**Description:** Isabella helps Abuela set the table for dinner — a square wooden table with four chairs (Sebastian sometimes eats in his room, but Mama insists on family dinner). Isabella carries plates one at a time from the kitchen shelf to the table, holding each with both hands, concentrating on not dropping them. The plates are ceramic, white with a blue border pattern. She places a fork and knife at each setting, then folds paper napkins — Abuela showed her a fancy fold once, but tonight simple triangles will do. She counts the settings: "Uno para Mami, dos para Abue, tres para Sebas, cuatro para mí." She adds a serving spoon for the center.

### Scene 146: Abuela Plating the Dinner
**Time:** 5:55 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Abuela lifts the lid from the large pot on the stove, releasing a fragrant cloud of steam. Tonight's dinner: arroz con pollo — chicken pieces simmered with yellow rice, vegetables, and seasoning. The rice is golden from sazón and achiote, studded with peas, carrot pieces, and red pepper strips. Abuela ladles portions onto plates. On a separate plate, she arranges patacones — twice-fried green plantain discs, flat and golden, crunchy on the outside. A small bowl of hogao (tomato and onion sauce) sits on the counter for topping. Isabella watches, standing on tiptoes to see into the pot. "¿Ya, Abue?" — Ready? "Ya casi, mi amor."

### Scene 147: Carrying the Serving Bowl to the Table
**Time:** 6:00 PM — warm kitchen and dining light
**Setting:** Kitchen to dining area, Isabella walking
**Description:** Isabella carefully carries a ceramic serving bowl filled with arroz con pollo from the kitchen to the dining table, the bowl warm against her palms. She walks slowly, watching the contents to make sure nothing sloshes over. Mama follows with the plate of patacones and the bowl of hogao. Abuela brings a pitcher of fresh lemonade. The table is set, the food arranged in the center. The house fills with the savory aroma of the chicken and rice. Sebastian appears from his room — the smell has drawn him. "¿Arroz con pollo?" His expression transforms from teenage indifference to genuine enthusiasm.

### Scene 148: Family Seated for Dinner
**Time:** 6:05 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, wide shot
**Description:** The family sits around the square table: Mama at the head, Abuela to her right, Isabella to her left, Sebastian across. Abuela leads a brief prayer — hands folded, heads bowed. "Señor, bendice estos alimentos..." Isabella sneaks a glance at the arroz con pollo during the prayer, stomach growling audibly, which makes Sebastian snicker. "Amén." "¡Buen provecho!" The serving begins. Mama spoons arroz con pollo onto Isabella's plate — a generous mound of golden rice with a chicken leg. Isabella reaches for a patacón before her plate is even fully served. The dining area is warm, the overhead light casting yellow warmth on the family.

### Scene 149: Isabella Eating Arroz con Pollo
**Time:** 6:15 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, close-up on Isabella
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella eating dinner. She uses her fork to mix the rice and chicken, then lifts a loaded bite to her mouth. A grain of yellow rice sticks to her cheek. She crunches a patacón — the crispy fried plantain breaking into pieces, salt crystals visible on the golden surface. She dips a piece into the hogao sauce, the tomato and onion mixture adding moisture and flavor. Her expression is pure satisfaction — this is her favorite dinner. She reaches for her glass of lemonade, the pale yellow liquid sloshing. Her bare feet under the table are crossed at the ankles, swinging.

### Scene 150: Family Conversation at Dinner
**Time:** 6:25 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, group shot
**Description:** The family talks around the table. Mama asks Sebastian about school — he shrugs, says it was fine, mentions a science project. Isabella interrupts to tell Mama about her parrot drawing. Abuela mentions that Doña Carmen next door has been unwell. The conversation flows naturally — overlapping voices, laughter, the clink of forks on plates. Mama reaches across to wipe Isabella's cheek (the rice grain). Sebastian steals a patacón from Isabella's plate; she protests loudly. Mama gives them both a look. The family dinner is loud, warm, imperfect, and deeply loving.

### Scene 151: Laughing Together
**Time:** 6:35 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table, medium shot
**Description:** Something has made the whole family laugh — Sebastian's impression of a teacher, perhaps. Isabella laughs so hard she nearly chokes on her lemonade, coughing and giggling simultaneously. Mama pats her back. Abuela shakes her head but can't stop smiling. Even Sebastian grins — a rare unguarded teenage moment. Isabella's eyes water from laughing. The table has the beautiful mess of a meal in progress: half-eaten plates, a lemonade ring on the wood, a stray patacón on the tablecloth. The overhead light catches the lemonade pitcher, casting a pale yellow reflection.

### Scene 152: Abuela Serving Natilla
**Time:** 6:45 PM — warm dining light
**Setting:** Dining table
**Description:** Abuela brings out dessert: small ceramic bowls of natilla — a traditional Colombian custard, creamy and golden-brown, sprinkled with cinnamon on top. Isabella's eyes widen. "¡Natilla!" She claps her small hands together. The custard is smooth and jiggles slightly when Abuela sets the bowl down. Isabella takes her spoon and scoops carefully, eating the natilla in small bites to make it last. The cinnamon dusts her upper lip. Sebastian finishes his in three large spoonfuls — Isabella scolds him for not savoring it. Mama and Abuela exchange a smile over their own bowls.

### Scene 153: Helping Clear the Table
**Time:** 7:00 PM — evening kitchen light
**Setting:** Dining area to kitchen
**Description:** Dinner is over. Isabella stacks plates carefully — she's been taught: scrape scraps into the bin first, then stack. She carries the stack to the kitchen sink, reaching up to place them on the counter. Mama washes; Abuela dries with a rooster-print towel. Isabella returns for the glasses, then the serving bowl (Mama helps with the heavy one). Sebastian has disappeared — his contribution to cleanup is mysteriously absent, as usual. Isabella wipes the table with a damp cloth, making wide circles. The dining area returns to neutral, the meal's evidence erased except for the lingering aroma.

---

## PART 10: EVENING AND BEDTIME (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)

### Scene 154: Playing a Board Game with Mama
**Time:** 7:10 PM — living room light
**Setting:** Living room, on floor
**Description:** Isabella and Mama sit on the living room floor at the coffee table, a colorful board game between them — Parqués, the Colombian version of Parcheesi, with a bright game board of red, blue, yellow, and green paths. They take turns rolling dice and moving colored tokens. Isabella rolls a six and cheers, moving her yellow token forward. Mama groans dramatically when Isabella's token sends hers back to start. They laugh. Abuela watches from the couch, offering unsolicited advice. Sebastian has retreated to his room. The TV is off — board game night wins. Isabella's competitive streak shows in her focused expression as she plots her next move.

### Scene 155: Winning the Game
**Time:** 7:25 PM — living room light
**Setting:** Living room, close-up on game board
**Description:** Isabella moves her final yellow token into the home space on the Parqués board. "¡Gané! ¡GANÉ!" She throws her arms up, bouncing on her knees. Mama claps, conceding defeat gracefully. Abuela nods from the couch — "¿Quién ganó?" — though she's been watching the whole time. Isabella does a little seated victory dance, shaking her shoulders, curly hair bouncing. She insists on playing again. Mama checks the time — "Uno más, pero rapidito." One more but quick. The dice clatter on the game board. The evening is warm and unhurried.

### Scene 156: Story Time with Abuela
**Time:** 7:40 PM — soft living room light
**Setting:** Living room couch, two shot
**Description:** Isabella cuddles against Abuela on the couch, legs tucked up, head resting against her grandmother's soft arm. Abuela holds a children's book — a colorful hardcover with a pirate ship on the cover, a story set in Cartagena's colonial era. She reads aloud in a gentle, rhythmic voice, changing pitch for different characters — gruff for the pirate, high for the princess, booming for the governor. Isabella follows the pictures on each page, pointing at details. "¡Mira, Abue, el loro!" — there's a parrot in the illustration, like the one she drew today. The reading lamp beside the couch casts a warm circle of light around them.

### Scene 157: Mama Calling for Bath Time
**Time:** 7:55 PM — hallway light
**Setting:** Living room/hallway
**Description:** Mama's voice comes from down the hallway: "¡Isabella, al baño!" — Bath time! Isabella groans, pulling Abuela's arm. "¡Otro capítulo!" — One more chapter! But Abuela closes the book, inserting a finger as a bookmark. "Mañana seguimos, mi amor." — We'll continue tomorrow. Isabella slides off the couch reluctantly, feet hitting the cool tile. She walks to the hallway, dragging her feet in exaggerated slowness. Mama waits at the bathroom door with a towel and clean pajamas draped over her arm. The sound of running water comes from inside.

### Scene 158: Bath Time — Getting In
**Time:** 8:00 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, medium shot
**Description:** The bathroom has white and pale blue tiles, a simple bathtub (no shower enclosure), a pedestal sink, and a toilet. The tub is half-filled with warm water, a few drops of bubble bath creating a thin layer of iridescent foam. Isabella steps in carefully, Mama holding her arm for balance. She sits down, the warm water rising to her chest. A few bath toys float — a yellow rubber duck, a small blue boat, a plastic starfish. Isabella immediately begins scooping foam and building a bubble beard on her chin, giggling. Mama kneels beside the tub on a small bath mat, sleeves rolled up, ready to wash Isabella's hair.

### Scene 159: Washing Hair
**Time:** 8:05 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at bathtub, close-up
**Description:** Mama pours water over Isabella's head from a plastic cup, wetting the thick dark curls. Isabella squeezes her eyes shut, face scrunched against the water. Mama applies children's shampoo — the bottle has a cartoon dolphin — and works it into the curly hair with her fingers, creating suds. She is gentle but thorough, working through tangles. Isabella holds the rubber duck and makes it "swim" through the foam while Mama washes. "No me eche agua en los ojos, Mami," Isabella pleads — don't get water in my eyes. Mama cups her hand across Isabella's forehead as she rinses, creating a dam.

### Scene 160: Playing with Bath Toys
**Time:** 8:10 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on bathtub water level
**Description:** Close-up at water level in the tub. Isabella pushes the small blue boat through the foam, making engine sounds. The yellow rubber duck bobs nearby. The plastic starfish lies on the side of the tub. Her small brown hands are pruney from the water. Soap suds cling to her arms. She creates a "wave" by pushing water toward the boat, which bobs and almost capsizes. She giggles. The water is starting to cool but she doesn't want to get out yet. Mama sits on the closed toilet lid, checking her phone briefly, letting Isabella have a few more minutes of water play.

### Scene 161: Getting Out of the Tub
**Time:** 8:15 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at tub
**Description:** Mama holds up a large towel — white with a rainbow border — and Isabella stands in the tub, dripping. She steps out carefully onto the bath mat, and Mama wraps the towel around her, rubbing vigorously. Isabella's curly hair drips water onto the towel. "¡Frío!" she says, shivering slightly even in the warm Cartagena air — the transition from warm water to air always feels cold. Mama towels her hair, scrunching the curls. The drain gurgles as the tub empties, the bath toys settling to the bottom. The rubber duck lies on its side.

### Scene 162: Drying and Brushing Hair
**Time:** 8:18 PM — bedroom light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at desk with mirror
**Description:** Mama sits Isabella on the desk chair and stands behind her, working a wide-toothed comb through her damp curly hair. Isabella winces and squirms at every tangle. "¡Ay, Mami, duele!" — Ouch, it hurts! Mama is gentle but persistent, working from the ends up, a technique that reduces pulling. She applies a small amount of leave-in conditioner from a pink bottle. The curls start to separate and define as Mama works through them. No braids tonight — the hair will air-dry in its natural curls for sleeping. Isabella watches in the small mirror, touching a curl that springs back when pulled.

### Scene 163: Putting on Pajamas
**Time:** 8:22 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, medium shot
**Description:** Isabella pulls on her pajamas — a two-piece cotton set printed with unicorns and stars, pink pants with a matching purple top. Mama helps her get her damp hair through the neck hole without pulling. Isabella buttons the top herself — she's proud of managing buttons now. The pajamas are soft and worn from many washes, a favorite pair. Her bare feet pad on the cool tile. She smells of children's shampoo and toothpaste (Mama made her brush teeth in the bathroom before pajamas). She's clean, warm, sleepy. The day is catching up.

### Scene 164: Saying Goodnight to Sebastian
**Time:** 8:24 PM — hallway light
**Setting:** Hallway, at Sebastian's door
**Description:** Isabella knocks on Sebastian's closed bedroom door. "¡Buenas noches, Sebas!" A muffled "Buenas noches, enana" comes back — goodnight, shorty. It's their ritual. Isabella smiles. She presses her palm flat against the door — the closest thing to a goodnight hug Sebastian will allow at thirteen. Through the door, the faint sound of music and the glow of a screen. Mama, watching from the hallway, smiles. The sibling dynamic: Isabella adores her brother; Sebastian pretends indifference but always calls her "enana" with affection.

### Scene 165: Goodnight Hugs — Mama and Abuela
**Time:** 8:25 PM — warm living room light
**Setting:** Living room, doorway
**Description:** Isabella hugs Mama tightly in the living room doorway. "Te amo, Mami." "Te amo más, mi amor." A kiss on the forehead. Then she turns to Abuela on the couch, who opens her arms wide. Isabella climbs into her lap for a final hug. Abuela holds her close, rocking slightly. "Que los angelitos te cuiden esta noche" — May the angels watch over you tonight. She makes the sign of the cross on Isabella's forehead with her thumb. Isabella's eyes are already heavy. Mama takes her hand and leads her down the hallway to bed.

### Scene 166: Tucked Into Bed
**Time:** 8:27 PM — dim bedroom light, nightlight
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Mama pulls back the butterfly-print cotton sheet and Isabella climbs into the small wooden bed. She arranges her stuffed animals: teddy bear on the right side, plush dolphin on the left. Mama tucks the sheet around her, smoothing it across her small body. She brushes a damp curl from Isabella's forehead. The pink alarm clock on the nightstand reads 8:27. The small nightlight — shaped like a crescent moon, plugged into the wall near the floor — glows a soft warm gold. The ceiling fan turns slowly above. Through the open window, the sounds of Cartagena at night drift in: distant music, a motorcycle, tree frogs beginning their chorus.

### Scene 167: Closing Eyes
**Time:** 8:28 PM — nightlight glow only
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, close-up on face
**Description:** Close-up of Isabella's face on the pillow, the nightlight's golden glow softening her brown skin. Her dark curly hair, still slightly damp, spreads across the white pillow. Her eyes are closing, lashes dark against her cheeks. She yawns — small mouth opening wide, then closing. One hand rests on the teddy bear. The plush dolphin is tucked under her other arm. She murmurs something — perhaps a fragment of Abuela's bedtime story, perhaps tomorrow's plans. Her breathing begins to slow and deepen. The ceiling fan hums its lullaby.

### Scene 168: Isabella Asleep
**Time:** 8:30 PM — nightlight glow
**Setting:** Isabella's bedroom, wide shot from doorway
**Description:** The bedroom is still and peaceful, seen from the doorway. Isabella sleeps in her small wooden bed, butterfly sheet pulled to her chin, stuffed animals flanking her like sentinels. The nightlight casts a warm golden pool on the tile floor. The cartoon posters on the pale pink walls are dim shapes. The desk with its colored pencils and the sketchbook with today's parrot drawing sits quiet. Through the open window, the Caribbean night breathes warm air and the distant sound of waves — Cartagena is a coastal city, and the sea is never far. Mama has left the door slightly ajar. The hallway light makes a thin bright line across the bedroom floor. Another school day complete. Isabella dreams, small and safe, in the house with the turquoise door.
