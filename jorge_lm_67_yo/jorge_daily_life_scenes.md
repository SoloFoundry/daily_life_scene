# A Day in the Life of Jorge: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Jorge, a 67-year-old Colombian coffee farmer living in rural Quindio, in the heart of Colombia's Coffee Triangle (Eje Cafetero).

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in real-world settings (coffee beans on the plant, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Rural Colombian/agricultural vocabulary rarely covered in traditional materials
- Cultural context embedded naturally (Colombian coffee culture)
- Elderly male perspective for diversity

## PART 1: BEFORE DAWN (4:30 AM - 5:15 AM)

### Scene 001: The Rooster Crows
**Time:** 4:30 AM -- pitch dark, faintest gray at horizon
**Setting:** Bedroom, viewed from foot of bed
**Description:** A 67-year-old Colombian man with weathered tan skin, short gray hair, and a gray mustache lies in a simple wooden bed under a colorful hand-woven blanket (cobija) with geometric patterns in red, orange, and brown. His wife Dona Carmen sleeps beside him, her gray hair loose on the pillow. The room is nearly pitch dark. Through a small window with no curtains, the barest hint of pre-dawn gray touches the sky above dark mountain silhouettes. On a simple wooden nightstand, an old wind-up alarm clock shows 4:30. A framed image of the Virgen del Carmen hangs on the whitewashed wall. Outside, a rooster crows loudly, the sound piercing the silence.

### Scene 002: Eyes Opening
**Time:** 4:31 AM -- dark with faint gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on Jorge's face
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's face on the pillow. His brown eyes open slowly, accustomed to waking at this hour after decades of farm life. Deep wrinkles line his forehead and the corners of his eyes. His gray mustache is slightly flattened from sleep. The colorful cobija is pulled up to his chin. The rooster crows again outside. A second alarm clock tick is faintly audible in the quiet room. The pre-dawn gray barely illuminates his weathered features.

### Scene 003: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 4:33 AM -- dark, faint gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, side view
**Description:** Jorge sits on the edge of the simple wooden bed, bare feet touching the cool terra-cotta tile floor. He wears a plain white undershirt and loose cotton sleep pants. His gray hair is slightly mussed. He moves carefully, quietly, so as not to wake Dona Carmen, who shifts slightly under the colorful blanket. The wooden bed frame creaks softly. On the nightstand beside him, the old alarm clock ticks. A small wooden crucifix hangs above the headboard. The room is sparse: a dark wooden wardrobe against one wall, a wooden chair with folded clothes draped over it, a woven rug on the tile floor.

### Scene 004: Feet on Cold Tile
**Time:** 4:34 AM -- dark room
**Setting:** Bedroom, low angle close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's bare feet pressing onto the cool terra-cotta tile floor. His toenails are thick, slightly yellowed from years in rubber boots. The woven rug is just out of reach. The wooden bed frame leg is visible in the foreground. A pair of simple house sandals (alpargatas) sits on the floor nearby. The cold tile wakes him fully. Shadows fill the room, only the faintest gray light seeping through the small window.

### Scene 005: Morning Prayer at Altar
**Time:** 4:36 AM -- dark room, candle unlit
**Setting:** Bedroom corner, small home altar
**Description:** Jorge stands before a small home altar in the corner of the bedroom -- a narrow wooden shelf mounted on the whitewashed wall holding a small ceramic statue of the Virgin Mary painted in blue and white, a simple wooden cross, a sprig of dried palm fronds from Palm Sunday, and a half-melted white candle in a tin holder. He makes the sign of the cross with his right hand, head bowed, eyes closed. His weathered hands come together in prayer. His lips move silently. A moment of daily devotion before the work begins. Dona Carmen's sleeping form is visible in the background under the colorful cobija.

### Scene 006: Opening the Wardrobe
**Time:** 4:39 AM -- growing gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, facing wardrobe
**Description:** Jorge opens the dark wooden wardrobe with both hands. The doors swing outward with a soft creak. Inside hang a few plaid flannel shirts -- blue-and-white, red-and-black, green-and-brown -- sturdy work pants, and a single white dress shirt for Sundays. On the wardrobe floor sit folded undershirts and socks. A small mirror is affixed to the inside of the left door, reflecting Jorge's face in the dim light. The pre-dawn gray through the window has strengthened slightly.

### Scene 007: Pulling on Work Pants
**Time:** 4:40 AM -- dim gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, side view
**Description:** Jorge sits on the edge of the bed, pulling on sturdy old worn jeans -- faded at the knees, patched once near the right thigh. He lifts one leg, then the other, working the denim over his calves. His white undershirt is still on from sleep. Dona Carmen stirs slightly but does not wake. The wardrobe stands open behind him, the plaid shirts visible inside.

### Scene 008: Buttoning the Flannel Shirt
**Time:** 4:42 AM -- dim gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, front view
**Description:** Jorge stands before the small mirror inside the wardrobe door, buttoning a blue-and-white plaid flannel shirt over his white undershirt. His calloused fingers work the buttons from bottom to top. The shirt is faded and soft from hundreds of washes but still sturdy. His gray hair is reflected in the small mirror. The shirt's sleeves are long -- protection from sun, branches, and insects in the coffee fields.

### Scene 009: Rolling Up Sleeves
**Time:** 4:43 AM -- dim gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on arms
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's forearms as he rolls the flannel sleeves up to just below his elbows. His forearms are sinewy and tanned, covered with fine gray hairs. His calloused hands fold the fabric neatly, two precise rolls per sleeve -- a practiced motion done thousands of times. The plaid pattern of the shirt is clearly visible. His thin wedding band glints faintly on his left ring finger.

### Scene 010: Walking to Main Room
**Time:** 4:45 AM -- dim gray light
**Setting:** Hallway between bedroom and main room
**Description:** Jorge walks softly through the narrow hallway connecting the bedroom to the farmhouse main room, his bare feet quiet on the terra-cotta tile. The whitewashed walls are bare except for a small framed photograph of his adult children. The hallway is dark, but gray pre-dawn light enters from the main room ahead. He glances back toward the bedroom door, making sure he has not woken Carmen.

### Scene 011: Sitting on Bench for Boots
**Time:** 4:47 AM -- dim pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Farmhouse main room, near front door
**Description:** Jorge sits on a worn wooden bench near the front door of the finca. He reaches for his tall green rubber boots (botas pantaneras) lined up beside the door. The boots are caked with dried mud on the soles, their green rubber scuffed and worn from years of use. Other boots and work shoes line the wall -- Carmen's smaller pair, a spare set. A machete in a cracked leather sheath hangs from a nail on the wall. The main room has simple wooden furniture, a bench along the wall, and religious images on the whitewashed walls.

### Scene 012: Pulling on Right Boot
**Time:** 4:48 AM -- dim pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Main room, close-up on boot
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's hands gripping the top of a tall green rubber boot, pulling it onto his right foot. His thick sock disappears into the boot shaft. The rubber is worn smooth at the heel and toe, the green faded to an olive color. His calloused fingers grip the boot edges firmly. A grunt of effort -- 67-year-old knees protesting the bend.

### Scene 013: Pulling on Left Boot
**Time:** 4:49 AM -- dim pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Main room, close-up on boots
**Description:** Jorge pulls on the second rubber boot, left foot sliding in. He stamps both feet on the tile floor, settling his feet into the boots. Both boots now on, he stands, the rubber soles squeaking faintly on the tile. His worn jeans tuck into the boot tops. He is nearly dressed for the fields.

### Scene 014: Taking the Sombrero
**Time:** 4:50 AM -- dim pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Main room, wall hooks
**Description:** Jorge reaches up to a wooden hook on the wall and lifts down his wide-brimmed straw hat (sombrero aguadeno). The hat is weathered -- its brim slightly curled, the crown darkened with years of sweat and sun, a simple black cord chin strap dangling. He places it on his head, the wide brim instantly shading his face. Other hats hang on neighboring hooks -- Carmen's wide sun hat, a spare work hat. The machete sheath still hangs on the wall nearby.

### Scene 015: Strapping on the Machete
**Time:** 4:51 AM -- dim pre-dawn light
**Setting:** Main room, close-up on belt
**Description:** Jorge lifts the machete in its cracked brown leather sheath from the wall hook and threads it onto his belt on the left side. The leather sheath is darkened and supple from years of use, the machete handle worn smooth where his hand grips it daily. He adjusts it so it hangs at his hip, a natural weight he barely notices anymore. The blade inside is well-sharpened -- essential for clearing paths and cutting branches.

## PART 2: EARLY MORNING KITCHEN (5:15 AM - 5:45 AM)

### Scene 016: Entering the Kitchen
**Time:** 5:15 AM -- dim pre-dawn light, warm glow from stove
**Setting:** Farmhouse kitchen doorway
**Description:** Jorge walks through the doorway into the farmhouse kitchen. The kitchen is lit by the warm orange glow of embers in the wood-burning stove (fogon de lena) -- Carmen must have banked the coals last night. The kitchen is simple and functional: a heavy wooden counter along one wall, pots and pans hanging from iron hooks on the ceiling beams, a small modern refrigerator (a recent addition, humming softly), open shelves with stacked dishes and cups, a window looking out toward the coffee plantation. The terra-cotta tile floor continues from the main room. A wooden table with four chairs sits in the center.

### Scene 017: Stoking the Wood Stove
**Time:** 5:16 AM -- warm firelight
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the stove
**Description:** Jorge crouches before the wood-burning fogon, a heavy clay-and-brick stove built into the kitchen wall. He lifts the iron grate and pushes kindling -- thin sticks of dried guadua bamboo -- onto the glowing coals. The embers brighten, and small flames lick at the new wood. His weathered face is lit orange by the fire. A stack of split firewood sits in a wooden bin beside the stove. Smoke curls upward into the blackened chimney. The fogon has two burner circles on its flat top surface, both blackened from use.

### Scene 018: Adding Larger Wood
**Time:** 5:18 AM -- growing firelight
**Setting:** Kitchen, stove close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's calloused hand placing a thicker piece of firewood onto the now-crackling flames inside the fogon. The fire catches and roars softly, heat radiating outward. Sparks float upward. His hand is steady despite the heat. The iron grate glows red at the edges. Soot and ash crust the inside of the stove. The warmth fills the kitchen on this cool mountain morning.

### Scene 019: Placing the Kettle
**Time:** 5:19 AM -- warm firelight, pre-dawn outside
**Setting:** Kitchen, stove top
**Description:** Jorge places a blackened aluminum kettle on the flat top of the wood-burning fogon, directly over the flame circle. The kettle is dented and scorched from years of daily use, its handle wrapped in wire where the original broke. Water sloshes inside as he sets it down. The fire crackles beneath. He positions the kettle precisely over the hottest spot -- a farmer's practiced knowledge.

### Scene 020: Getting the Coffee Grounds
**Time:** 5:20 AM -- kitchen lit by firelight and gray dawn
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the shelf
**Description:** Jorge reaches up to an open wooden shelf and takes down a metal canister of ground coffee. He pries off the lid with his thumb, revealing dark brown grounds inside -- coffee from his own farm, roasted and ground by Carmen. The rich, earthy aroma of Colombian coffee fills the air. Beside the canister on the shelf sit other supplies: a bag of panela (raw cane sugar blocks), a tin of salt, a jar of dried herbs. The kitchen window behind shows the sky turning from black to deep blue.

### Scene 021: Preparing the Cloth Filter
**Time:** 5:22 AM -- warming kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, counter
**Description:** Jorge sets up the traditional coffee brewing apparatus on the wooden counter: a metal ring holder with a cloth filter (colador de tela) hanging from it, positioned over a blackened metal pot. The cloth filter is stained dark brown from thousands of brews, clean but permanently coffee-colored. He spoons ground coffee from the canister into the cloth filter -- three heaping spoonfuls with a tarnished metal spoon. The grounds settle into the filter's bowl shape. Steam begins to rise from the kettle on the stove behind him.

### Scene 022: Pouring Hot Water Through Filter
**Time:** 5:25 AM -- warm kitchen glow
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up on brewing
**Description:** Jorge lifts the steaming blackened kettle from the fogon with a folded cloth to protect his hand and pours a steady stream of hot water through the cloth filter. The water hits the dark coffee grounds and begins to drip through, a rich dark brown stream falling into the metal pot below. Steam and coffee aroma billow upward. His pour is slow, circular, saturating all the grounds evenly. The dark liquid pools in the pot, thick and aromatic. This is tinto -- strong black Colombian coffee, the way it has been made on this finca for generations.

### Scene 023: Pouring First Cup of Tinto
**Time:** 5:28 AM -- warm kitchen, growing dawn outside
**Setting:** Kitchen, counter
**Description:** Jorge pours tinto from the metal pot into a small metal cup -- a pocillo, simple and handleless, slightly dented. The coffee is dark as night, steaming. He reaches for a block of panela on the shelf -- a hard block of unrefined cane sugar, golden-brown and rough-textured. With a knife, he shaves off a few pieces directly into the cup. The panela dissolves quickly in the hot liquid, sweetening the bitter coffee. This is his first cup of the day, the most important one.

### Scene 024: Drinking Tinto at the Window
**Time:** 5:30 AM -- growing dawn light through window
**Setting:** Kitchen, standing at window
**Description:** Jorge stands at the kitchen window, both hands wrapped around the warm metal pocillo, sipping his tinto. Through the window, the coffee plantation stretches out in rows on the terraced hillside, still dark and shrouded in morning mist. The Andes mountains rise in the far distance, their peaks barely visible against the deep blue pre-dawn sky. A faint orange glow lines the eastern horizon. Jorge's face is contemplative, weathered features lit from one side by the fire glow and from the other by the approaching dawn. He drinks slowly, savoring.

### Scene 025: Carmen Enters the Kitchen
**Time:** 5:32 AM -- dawn light growing
**Setting:** Kitchen doorway
**Description:** Dona Carmen appears in the kitchen doorway, a 64-year-old Colombian woman with silver-gray hair pulled back in a loose bun, warm brown eyes, and a round kind face. She wears a simple cotton housedress with a floral pattern and a worn apron tied at her waist. She smiles at Jorge, says "Buenos dias, viejo," and moves toward the stove. Jorge nods, lifts his pocillo in greeting. The kitchen is warmer now, the fire burning well, the first light of dawn reaching through the window.

### Scene 026: Carmen Heating Aguapanela
**Time:** 5:34 AM -- dawn light, warm kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the stove
**Description:** Carmen places a second pot on the fogon and drops in a large chunk of panela -- the golden-brown block of raw cane sugar. She adds water from a clay pitcher. The panela begins to dissolve in the heating water, turning it amber. This is aguapanela, a traditional Colombian drink -- warm sweetened water that fuels farm workers. She stirs with a wooden spoon, the panela breaking apart. Steam rises from both the coffee pot and the aguapanela pot. The kitchen fills with sweet and earthy aromas.

### Scene 027: Carmen Warming Arepas
**Time:** 5:36 AM -- dawn light
**Setting:** Kitchen, stove and griddle
**Description:** Carmen places pre-made arepas -- round, flat corn cakes, white and slightly thick -- onto a cast-iron griddle (budare) on the second burner of the fogon. The arepas sizzle as they touch the hot surface. She made the dough last night. The corn cakes begin to develop golden-brown spots on their undersides. A block of white cheese (queso fresco) sits on a wooden cutting board on the counter, ready to be sliced.

### Scene 028: Jorge Sitting at Table
**Time:** 5:38 AM -- dawn light through window
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Jorge sits at the worn wooden table, his sombrero removed and hung on the back of his chair, his pocillo of tinto in front of him. The table surface is scarred and stained from decades of meals. Four mismatched wooden chairs surround it. Through the window, the dawn sky is turning from deep blue to pale gray with streaks of orange. The fire crackles in the fogon. Carmen moves between stove and counter, preparing the simple breakfast.

### Scene 029: Carmen Slicing Cheese
**Time:** 5:39 AM -- morning light growing
**Setting:** Kitchen, counter close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Carmen's hands slicing thick pieces of white queso fresco on a wooden cutting board. The cheese is soft, fresh, crumbly at the edges. A simple kitchen knife cuts through it cleanly. The white slices are thick, meant to be placed on the warm arepas. The cheese was likely brought from a neighbor or the local market. Beside the cutting board sits a small ceramic bowl of butter (mantequilla).

### Scene 030: Breakfast on the Table
**Time:** 5:40 AM -- soft morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Carmen sets the simple breakfast on the wooden table before Jorge: two warm arepas on a clay plate, golden-brown and steaming, with thick slices of queso fresco laid on top melting slightly from the heat. A cup of warm aguapanela steams beside the plate, amber-colored and sweet. Jorge's pocillo of tinto sits half-empty. A small dish of butter and a salt shaker are on the table. The meal is simple but sustaining -- fuel for hours of hard physical labor ahead.

### Scene 031: Eating Arepa with Cheese
**Time:** 5:42 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's weathered hands breaking open a warm arepa, the corn cake splitting to reveal its soft white interior. He places a thick slice of melting queso fresco inside, pressing it together like a sandwich. His calloused fingers handle the food with rough tenderness. Steam rises from the split arepa. Crumbs of corn cake dot the clay plate. His wedding band catches the morning light entering through the window.

### Scene 032: Drinking Aguapanela
**Time:** 5:44 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge lifts the cup of warm aguapanela to his lips and drinks deeply. The amber liquid is sweet and warming -- dissolved panela in hot water, the traditional energy drink of Colombian campo workers. His eyes close briefly as he swallows, savoring the familiar sweetness. Carmen sits across from him now, eating her own arepa, sipping her tinto. A brief, comfortable exchange of words about the day ahead -- which rows to pick, the weather forecast he heard on the radio last night.

### Scene 033: Rising from the Table
**Time:** 5:46 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, table
**Description:** Jorge pushes back from the table, the wooden chair scraping on the tile floor. He drains the last of his tinto, sets the pocillo down with a soft clink. Carmen begins clearing the plates. He stands, stretches his back slightly -- a familiar morning stiffness in his lower spine -- and reaches for his sombrero on the chair back. He places it on his head, adjusts the brim. The machete at his belt shifts as he moves. Time to head out.

---

## PART 3: WALKING TO COFFEE FIELDS (5:45 AM - 6:15 AM)

### Scene 034: Stepping Onto the Porch
**Time:** 5:48 AM -- soft golden dawn light
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch (corredor), front view
**Description:** Jorge steps through the front door of the finca onto the covered porch (corredor). The traditional farmhouse has whitewashed walls, a red terra-cotta tile roof supported by thick wooden columns, and a wide covered porch running along the front. Potted plants line the porch railing -- red geraniums, pink begonias, green ferns in clay pots. Two wooden rocking chairs sit against the wall. A hammock hangs in one corner, its woven fabric swaying slightly in the dawn breeze. The morning air is cool and damp, carrying the scent of wet earth and coffee blossoms.

### Scene 035: Porch View of the Farm
**Time:** 5:49 AM -- golden dawn breaking
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch, wide panoramic view
**Description:** Wide view from the porch looking outward. The landscape unfolds: terraced hillsides covered in orderly rows of dark-green coffee plants, their leaves glistening with morning dew. Banana trees and tall plantain palms are interspersed among the coffee rows, providing shade. Mist clings to the valleys between the green hills. In the far distance, the blue-gray peaks of the Andes mountains emerge above the fog. The sky is pale gold and pink at the horizon, deep blue overhead. A hummingbird hovers near a flowering bush beside the porch. The dirt path leads downhill from the porch steps into the plantation.

### Scene 036: Walking Down the Porch Steps
**Time:** 5:50 AM -- golden dawn light
**Setting:** Porch steps, looking down
**Description:** Jorge walks down the three wooden steps from the porch to the dirt path below. His green rubber boots land solidly on the packed earth. The farm dog -- a medium-sized brown-and-white mixed breed -- bounds up to greet him, tail wagging, circling his legs. Jorge pats the dog's head absently, a morning ritual. The path stretches ahead, reddish-brown dirt with scattered gravel, bordered by low grass and a wooden fence.

### Scene 037: Passing the Drying Patio
**Time:** 5:52 AM -- soft morning light
**Setting:** Farm path, near drying area
**Description:** Jorge walks along the dirt path past the drying patio (marquesina) -- a large flat concrete surface where coffee beans are spread to dry in the sun. Currently it is covered with blue plastic tarps from last night, weighted down with stones at the edges to protect beans from dew. He glances at it, noting the tarps are secure. Beside the patio stands the beneficiadero (processing station), a covered wooden structure with corrugated metal roof. The path continues uphill toward the coffee fields.

### Scene 038: Walking Through Morning Mist
**Time:** 5:55 AM -- misty golden light
**Setting:** Dirt path through farm, misty
**Description:** Jorge walks steadily along the narrow dirt path that winds uphill through the coffee plantation. Thick morning mist wraps around the coffee plants on either side, their dark green leaves emerging from white fog like a painting. Dew drops hang from every leaf, catching the first golden rays of sunlight. His sombrero is a dark silhouette against the misty golden background. The farm dog trots ahead, disappearing into and reappearing from the fog. His rubber boots leave prints in the damp reddish earth. Spider webs between the coffee branches are highlighted by dew, glittering like jewels.

### Scene 039: Passing the Chicken Coop
**Time:** 5:58 AM -- morning light through mist
**Setting:** Farm path, near chicken coop
**Description:** Jorge passes the chicken coop -- a simple wooden structure with wire mesh walls and a corrugated tin roof. Inside, chickens cluck and flutter, awake and restless. The rooster that woke him stands on a fence post, proud and alert, his red comb bright against the green backdrop. Jorge makes a mental note to come back to feed them later, or perhaps Carmen will handle it this morning. Feathers litter the ground around the coop. The pig pen is visible further down the slope, two pigs already grunting.

### Scene 040: Entering the Coffee Rows
**Time:** 6:02 AM -- golden morning light breaking through mist
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, edge of field
**Description:** Jorge steps off the main path into the rows of coffee plants. The plants stand chest-high, their branches heavy with clusters of coffee cherries in various stages of ripeness -- bright red ripe ones, orange ones nearly ready, and green unripe ones. The shade trees tower above -- guamo trees with their broad canopy, banana palms with their massive drooping leaves, and the occasional plantain tree with a heavy bunch of green fruit. The mist is beginning to thin as the sun rises, golden light slanting between the shade trees. A toucan calls from somewhere above. The air smells of wet vegetation, rich soil, and faint coffee blossom sweetness.

### Scene 041: Surveying the Field
**Time:** 6:05 AM -- brightening morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, elevated view
**Description:** Jorge stands at the top of a terraced row, hands on his hips, surveying the coffee field stretching below. Rows of coffee plants cascade down the hillside in organized lines, their dark green canopy punctuated by clusters of red cherries. He assesses which rows are ready for harvest -- those with the most red among the green. His experienced eyes read the field like a book. The mist is lifting, revealing more of the landscape: neighboring fincas on distant hillsides, a narrow stream glinting in the valley below. The sun is now a warm presence above the eastern mountains.

### Scene 042: Meeting the Workers
**Time:** 6:10 AM -- bright morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, gathering area
**Description:** Jorge arrives at a flat clearing at the edge of the coffee field where two hired workers (jornaleros) already wait. They are younger men -- one in his 30s, one in his 20s -- wearing similar work clothes: long-sleeve shirts, work pants, rubber boots, straw hats. They greet Jorge warmly -- "Buenos dias, Don Jorge" -- with handshakes and respectful nods. Canvas sacks and woven picking baskets (cocos and canastas) are piled on the ground. A water jug sits in the shade of a guamo tree. Jorge discusses the day's plan, pointing to the rows they will harvest.

### Scene 043: Strapping on the Picking Basket
**Time:** 6:13 AM -- bright morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, gathering area
**Description:** Jorge lifts a traditional woven picking basket (coco) and straps it to his waist with a canvas strap that goes over one shoulder and around his torso. The coco hangs at his hip, its wide mouth open and ready to receive cherries. The basket is handwoven from natural fiber, well-worn and stained red from years of holding ripe coffee cherries. The workers do the same, each adjusting their cocos. Large empty canvas sacks are left at the collection point, waiting to be filled.

## PART 4: MORNING COFFEE PICKING (6:15 AM - 9:00 AM)

### Scene 044: First Pick of the Day
**Time:** 6:15 AM -- bright morning light filtering through shade trees
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, among the rows
**Description:** Jorge positions himself before a coffee plant heavy with ripe red cherries. He reaches into the branch with his right hand, fingers finding a cluster of bright red cherries among the green leaves. With a practiced twist and pull, he separates three ripe red cherries from the stem, leaving the green ones untouched. The cherries drop into his open left palm -- small, glossy, the deep crimson of perfect ripeness. He transfers them to the coco basket at his waist. The first pick of the day. The plant's dark green leaves are still wet with morning dew.

### Scene 045: Selective Picking Close-Up
**Time:** 6:20 AM -- dappled morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plant, extreme close-up
**Description:** Extreme close-up of Jorge's weathered right hand amid coffee branches. His calloused fingers -- stained reddish-brown from decades of handling coffee -- carefully select only the bright red ripe cherries, bypassing clusters of green, yellow, and orange ones that need more time. Each ripe cherry is plucked individually with a gentle twist. A cluster shows the full color spectrum: green (unripe), yellow (turning), orange (almost), bright red (ready), and a few dark burgundy (overripe). His fingernails are short, worn, dirt embedded under the edges. This selective hand-picking is what makes Colombian specialty coffee exceptional.

### Scene 046: Moving Along the Row
**Time:** 6:25 AM -- morning light, shade and sun patches
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, row view
**Description:** Jorge moves slowly along the row of coffee plants, stepping carefully between them. He works each plant methodically -- reaching in, selecting red cherries, dropping them into the coco at his waist with a soft patter. The basket is beginning to fill, a growing mound of red cherries. His rubber boots press into the soft reddish soil between the rows. Coffee plant branches brush against his flannel shirt. Shade tree canopy above creates a dappled pattern of light and shadow. The worker in the next row over is visible through the leaves, also picking steadily.

### Scene 047: Examining a Branch for Disease
**Time:** 6:32 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plant, close-up on leaves
**Description:** Jorge pauses his picking to examine a coffee plant's leaves closely. He lifts a branch, turning the leaves over to inspect their undersides. He looks for la roya (coffee leaf rust) -- orange-yellow spots on the leaf underside that indicate the devastating fungal disease. This particular leaf looks healthy -- dark green, glossy, no spots. He nods with satisfaction and releases the branch. A farmer's constant vigilance, checking crop health even while harvesting. His sombrero shades his face as he peers closely.

### Scene 048: Picking Rhythm Established
**Time:** 6:40 AM -- warm morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, mid-row
**Description:** Jorge has settled into the picking rhythm -- reach, select, pluck, drop into basket, step forward, repeat. His movements are efficient and unhurried, born of 45 years of this exact work. The coco basket at his waist fills steadily, red cherries piling higher. Sweat begins to form on his brow beneath the sombrero brim. A bright green hummingbird hovers near a coffee flower cluster beside him, its wings a blur. The sun is climbing, the air warming. The mist has fully burned away, revealing the full panorama of green mountains.

### Scene 049: Reaching a High Branch
**Time:** 6:50 AM -- bright morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, upward angle
**Description:** Jorge stretches upward to reach cherries on a higher branch of a tall coffee plant. He stands on his toes in the rubber boots, one hand steadying the branch, the other plucking red cherries. His flannel shirt lifts slightly, revealing the leather machete sheath at his belt. The cherries at the top are the ripest, having gotten the most sun. He grimaces slightly at the stretch -- his back protests these days. The bright blue sky is visible through the canopy of shade trees above.

### Scene 050: Coco Half Full
**Time:** 7:00 AM -- bright morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, close-up on basket
**Description:** Close-up of the coco picking basket at Jorge's waist, now half full of bright red coffee cherries. The cherries glisten in the sun, plump and firm. A few leaves and small stems are mixed in. The woven basket shows its handmade construction -- natural fiber, tightly woven, stained deep reddish-brown from years of cherries. Jorge's hand drops another handful of cherries into the basket with a soft rattling sound. The canvas strap digs slightly into his shoulder.

### Scene 051: Wiping Sweat with Handkerchief
**Time:** 7:10 AM -- bright, warming sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, between rows
**Description:** Jorge pauses in the shade of a guamo tree, lifting his sombrero to wipe his brow with a faded cotton handkerchief pulled from his back pocket. His gray hair is damp with sweat, pressed flat from the hat. The handkerchief is white with blue edges, worn soft from washing. He squints against the brightness as his hat comes off, the sun now strong on the eastern-facing slopes. He exhales heavily, folds the handkerchief, and replaces it. A brief moment of rest before continuing.

### Scene 052: Drinking Water
**Time:** 7:15 AM -- bright morning
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, shade of tree
**Description:** Jorge drinks from a plastic water bottle he pulls from a canvas satchel hanging on a guamo tree branch -- a communal water station for the pickers. The water is not cold but it is refreshing. He drinks deeply, his throat working, then pours a small amount into his cupped hand and splashes it on the back of his neck. The cool water runs down into his collar. He replaces the bottle and heads back into the rows.

### Scene 053: Chatting with a Worker
**Time:** 7:22 AM -- bright morning
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, between rows
**Description:** Jorge and the younger worker (jornalero) meet at the end of a row, both pausing to compare their baskets. The young man's coco is fuller -- faster young hands. Jorge nods approvingly, pointing out a section they should move to next. They exchange a few words about the quality of this year's harvest -- good rain, good cherries. The young man laughs at something Jorge says. Two generations of coffee pickers, the knowledge passing between them. Their straw hats and plaid shirts mirror each other.

### Scene 054: Transferring Cherries to Sack
**Time:** 7:30 AM -- warm morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, collection point
**Description:** Jorge's coco is full. He walks to the collection point -- a flat area at the end of the row where large canvas sacks wait. He carefully tips the coco basket, pouring the red coffee cherries into the open mouth of a canvas sack. The cherries tumble in with a rushing sound, like marbles. The sack already has a layer from the young worker's earlier deposit. Jorge shakes the last cherries from the basket, then restraps the empty coco at his waist. The sack is stamped with faded lettering.

### Scene 055: Starting New Row
**Time:** 7:35 AM -- warm morning
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, new section
**Description:** Jorge moves to the next row of coffee plants, a section on a slightly steeper slope. He plants his rubber boots firmly in the soft red earth, which is still damp from overnight moisture. The coffee plants here are slightly taller, more mature, and heavy with cherries. He begins picking again -- the reaching, selecting, plucking rhythm resuming. A blue-and-yellow tanager bird lands on a branch nearby, watching him briefly before flitting away. The mountainside air is warm now, fragrant with vegetation.

### Scene 056: Working the Steep Slope
**Time:** 7:50 AM -- mid-morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, hillside angle
**Description:** Jorge works on a steep section of the plantation, his boots digging into the hillside soil for purchase. The coffee rows follow the contour of the hill. He braces himself with one hand on a plant trunk while picking with the other. His strong legs, built by decades of walking these slopes, keep him steady. The machete at his belt swings with his movement. Below him, the valley is visible through gaps in the coffee canopy -- other fincas, the glint of a stream, a dirt road winding between properties.

### Scene 057: Inspecting Overripe Cherries
**Time:** 8:00 AM -- mid-morning
**Setting:** Coffee plant, close-up
**Description:** Jorge pauses at a plant where several cherries have gone past ripe -- dark burgundy, almost black, wrinkled and soft. He picks these separately, placing them in a small cloth bag tied to his belt rather than in the coco with the good ones. Overripe cherries produce inferior coffee. His fingers press one between thumb and forefinger, testing -- too soft, the fruit beginning to ferment on the branch. He frowns slightly, noting that this section needed picking a few days ago.

### Scene 058: Second Coco Full
**Time:** 8:10 AM -- mid-morning, hot sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, collection point
**Description:** Jorge empties his second full coco of the morning into the canvas sack at the collection point. The sack is now a third full, heavy with red cherries. He stretches his back, pressing both hands into his lower spine, wincing slightly. The morning heat is building. His flannel shirt is darkened with sweat at the back and under the arms. The young worker dumps his basket into a second sack nearby. They work well, steadily.

### Scene 059: Clearing a Path with Machete
**Time:** 8:20 AM -- mid-morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, overgrown section
**Description:** Jorge draws his machete from the leather sheath at his belt. The blade flashes in the sunlight -- about 18 inches long, slightly curved, well-sharpened. He uses it to clear a tangle of weeds and vines that have grown between two coffee rows, blocking passage. Two precise swings cut through the vegetation. He kicks the debris aside with his boot. The machete goes back into the sheath in a single smooth motion. A tool used a hundred times a day, an extension of his arm.

### Scene 060: Picking Continues
**Time:** 8:30 AM -- warm mid-morning
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, mid-row
**Description:** Jorge continues picking in the warm mid-morning sun. His movements are slower now, pacing himself for the long morning. The coco at his waist is filling again with red cherries. He has moved to a shaded section under a large guamo tree, where the temperature is a few degrees cooler. He hums a melody -- a vallenato, a Colombian folk song -- as he picks. The rhythm of the music matching the rhythm of his hands. Cherry by cherry, the harvest grows.

### Scene 061: A Bird in the Coffee
**Time:** 8:40 AM -- mid-morning light
**Setting:** Coffee plant, eye-level view
**Description:** A bright-feathered toucan -- black body, enormous yellow-and-red beak -- perches on a coffee branch just a few feet from Jorge. The bird eyes the red cherries. Jorge pauses, watching it with a half-smile. The bird plucks a ripe cherry in its massive beak and tosses it back, swallowing. Jorge waves his hand gently, shooing it -- "Fuera, pajaro" -- but without real anger. The birds take their share. It is the way of things. The toucan flutters to a higher branch, unfazed.

### Scene 062: Sun Getting Stronger
**Time:** 8:50 AM -- strong morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, wide view
**Description:** The sun has climbed high enough to break through even the shade tree canopy. Bright patches of direct sunlight fall on Jorge as he picks. His sombrero casts a sharp shadow over his face and shoulders. Sweat drips from his chin. The green coffee leaves shimmer in the heat. The younger worker has removed his hat to wipe his entire head with a rag. The mountains in the distance are hazy with heat shimmer. A few white clouds are building over the western peaks.

### Scene 063: Third Basket Emptied
**Time:** 9:00 AM -- bright, hot morning
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, collection point
**Description:** Jorge empties his third full coco into the collection sack. The first sack is now full and tied shut at the top with rope. A second sack is half full. He sets the full sack upright against a guamo tree trunk, tying it securely. The morning's work has been productive -- perhaps 60 kilos of fresh cherries collected between the three workers. Jorge's arms are tired, his back sore. He looks at the sacks with quiet satisfaction.

---

## PART 5: MID-MORNING BREAK (9:00 AM - 9:30 AM)

### Scene 064: Finding Shade
**Time:** 9:02 AM -- hot morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, under large shade tree
**Description:** Jorge walks to a large guamo tree at the edge of the coffee field and settles down in its shade. The tree's broad canopy creates a cool, dark circle on the ground. He lowers himself slowly, one hand on the tree trunk for support, knees cracking. He sits on a raised root, his back against the trunk. The rubber boots extend before him in the grass. He removes his sombrero and places it beside him, his gray hair damp and flattened. The two workers join him, sitting nearby on the ground.

### Scene 065: Carmen Arrives with Snack
**Time:** 9:05 AM -- shaded area, bright surrounding sun
**Setting:** Under the guamo tree
**Description:** Dona Carmen walks up the path from the farmhouse carrying a woven basket covered with a clean cloth. She has brought the mid-morning snack -- a tradition called medias nueves (morning break). She wears a wide sun hat over her gray bun, her floral housedress, and sturdy sandals. She smiles at the workers, greeting them warmly. Jorge watches her approach with affection, the familiar sight of his wife bringing sustenance as she has done for forty years.

### Scene 066: Unpacking the Basket
**Time:** 9:07 AM -- shade
**Setting:** Under the guamo tree, close-up on basket
**Description:** Carmen sets the woven basket on the grass and removes the cloth cover, revealing the contents: a thermos of hot tinto, several buñuelos (fried cheese balls, golden and round), a block of bocadillo (guava paste wrapped in banana leaf), chunks of white cheese, and a bag of small empanadas (corn dough pockets stuffed with meat). She places metal cups on the ground and begins pouring tinto from the thermos. The dark coffee steams in the cool shade.

### Scene 067: Jorge Eating Buñuelo
**Time:** 9:10 AM -- shade
**Setting:** Under the guamo tree
**Description:** Jorge bites into a golden buñuelo -- a fried ball of cheese dough, crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. Carmen made them this morning while he was in the fields. His weathered face relaxes with pleasure. He holds the buñuelo with both hands, chewing slowly. The cheese stretches slightly as he pulls the second bite away. The young workers eat eagerly beside him, picking empanadas from the basket.

### Scene 068: Drinking Break Tinto
**Time:** 9:13 AM -- shade
**Setting:** Under the guamo tree
**Description:** Jorge drinks tinto from a metal cup Carmen poured for him, holding a chunk of bocadillo (guava paste) in his other hand. The combination of bitter coffee and sweet guava is a traditional pairing in the coffee region. He alternates sips and bites. His tired hands rest on his knees between sips. The thermos sits on the grass beside the basket. Carmen pours for the workers too, mothering them with food.

### Scene 069: Resting Hands
**Time:** 9:16 AM -- shade
**Setting:** Under the guamo tree, close-up on hands
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's hands resting on his knees. His calloused palms are stained reddish-brown from the morning's cherry-picking. Deep creases line his palms. His fingers are thick, knuckles enlarged from decades of manual labor. Small cuts and scratches mark the backs of his hands from reaching through coffee branches. His thin wedding band sits on the left ring finger, nearly embedded in the swollen knuckle. These are the hands of a life lived in labor -- strong, worn, capable.

### Scene 070: Conversation Under the Tree
**Time:** 9:20 AM -- shade
**Setting:** Under the guamo tree
**Description:** Jorge talks with the workers as they eat. He gestures toward the lower fields, explaining which rows to move to after the break. The young worker asks about rain -- clouds are building to the west. Jorge studies the sky, tilts his head, draws on a lifetime of weather reading. "Llueve por la tarde," he predicts -- rain in the afternoon. They need to get the picked cherries to the processing station before then. Carmen packs the basket, listening.

### Scene 071: Carmen Heading Back
**Time:** 9:25 AM -- shade to sunlight
**Setting:** Path from guamo tree toward farmhouse
**Description:** Carmen picks up the emptied basket and heads back down the path toward the farmhouse, her sun hat bobbing as she walks. She waves over her shoulder. Jorge watches her go, then pushes himself to his feet using the tree trunk for support. He groans slightly -- the brief rest has stiffened his muscles. He puts his sombrero back on, adjusts the coco basket strap, and turns to the workers. "Vamos, muchachos." Back to work.

### Scene 072: Resuming Picking
**Time:** 9:30 AM -- hot mid-morning sun
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, lower rows
**Description:** Jorge and the workers move to the lower rows of the plantation, a section further from the house. The coffee plants here are newer, shorter, but producing well. Jorge begins picking again, his hands finding the rhythm quickly. The brief rest and food have restored some energy. The sun is strong but the shade trees help. Clouds are indeed building in the western sky. The race against afternoon rain begins.

---

## PART 6: COFFEE PROCESSING (9:30 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Scene 073: Carrying Sacks Downhill
**Time:** 9:35 AM -- bright, hot sun
**Setting:** Farm path, steep descent
**Description:** Jorge and the younger worker hoist full sacks of coffee cherries onto their shoulders. The sacks are heavy -- 50 to 60 kilos each -- and Jorge's knees protest on the steep downhill path. He walks carefully, rubber boots gripping the dirt, one hand steadying the sack on his shoulder. His face is strained with effort. The second worker follows with another sack. The path winds between coffee rows down toward the beneficiadero. A mule would be better for this, but Jorge's mule is being used by a neighbor today.

### Scene 074: Arriving at the Beneficiadero
**Time:** 9:45 AM -- bright morning
**Setting:** Beneficiadero (processing station), exterior
**Description:** Jorge arrives at the beneficiadero -- a covered wooden structure with a corrugated metal roof, open on two sides, built on a flat area below the farmhouse. Inside, the processing equipment is visible: the despulpadora (pulping machine), concrete fermentation tanks, and wooden sorting tables. A water channel runs along one side, fed by a pipe from the hillside spring. Jorge drops the sack with a heavy thud onto the concrete floor. He straightens, pressing a hand to his lower back. The younger workers arrive with their sacks, setting them beside his.

### Scene 075: Inspecting the Despulpadora
**Time:** 9:50 AM -- bright, shaded under roof
**Setting:** Beneficiadero interior, at the machine
**Description:** Jorge inspects the despulpadora -- the coffee pulping machine. It is a hand-cranked cast-iron machine, painted red, bolted to a heavy wooden table. A hopper on top receives cherries, and the mechanism inside squeezes off the outer fruit (pulpa) from the bean. Two chutes direct the separated parts: pulp falls into one trough, beans into another. Jorge checks that the mechanism is properly adjusted by rotating the crank a few times. The metal gears grind smoothly. He adds a drop of oil from a small can to the crank pivot.

### Scene 076: Pouring Cherries into Hopper
**Time:** 9:55 AM -- shaded under roof
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, at the despulpadora
**Description:** Jorge unties the first sack and pours bright red coffee cherries into the hopper of the despulpadora. The cherries tumble in, filling the metal hopper with a cascade of red. Some cherries bounce and roll on the floor. Jorge uses his hand to push the last ones in, his stained fingers scooping them up. The hopper is full, cherries mounding above the rim. The machine is ready to begin its work.

### Scene 077: Cranking the Despulpadora
**Time:** 10:00 AM -- shaded work area
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, at the machine
**Description:** The younger worker grips the crank handle of the despulpadora and begins turning it in a steady rhythm. The cast-iron gears engage with a grinding, mechanical sound. Cherries are pulled down from the hopper into the mechanism. Jorge feeds more cherries into the hopper as the level drops. From the lower chute, pulped coffee beans -- still covered in white sticky mucilage -- slide out into a wooden trough. From the other chute, the red pulp and skins are expelled into a separate container. The machine works methodically, cherry by cherry, separating fruit from bean.

### Scene 078: Mucilage-Covered Beans
**Time:** 10:05 AM -- shaded work area
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, close-up on pulped beans
**Description:** Close-up of freshly pulped coffee beans collecting in the wooden trough beneath the despulpadora. The beans are covered in white sticky mucilage -- a slippery, sweet-smelling coating that must be removed through fermentation. Each bean is still encased in its parchment layer (pergamino), giving them a pale greenish-yellow color beneath the translucent mucilage. Jorge's hand scoops up a handful, rubbing them between his fingers to check that the pulper has removed all the outer skin cleanly. His fingers are slick with the sticky substance.

### Scene 079: Coffee Pulp Byproduct
**Time:** 10:10 AM -- shaded
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, side view
**Description:** The discarded coffee pulp accumulates in a container beside the despulpadora -- a mass of red skins and fruit flesh. Jorge lifts the container and carries it to a compost pile behind the beneficiadero. Nothing is wasted on the finca. The pulp will decompose into fertilizer for the coffee plants, completing a natural cycle. The compost pile is dark and earthy, steaming slightly in the warm air. Banana peels and other organic waste are mixed in. He dumps the fresh red pulp on top.

### Scene 080: Second Sack Through the Pulper
**Time:** 10:15 AM -- shaded, warm
**Setting:** Beneficiadero
**Description:** Jorge and the worker continue processing the second sack of cherries through the despulpadora. The routine is smooth -- one cranking, one feeding. The trough of mucilage-covered beans grows fuller. The rhythmic grinding of the machine fills the beneficiadero. Sweat runs down the young worker's face from the effort of cranking. Jorge pauses to give him water from a jug. They switch positions -- Jorge takes the crank, the worker feeds the hopper.

### Scene 081: Jorge Cranking the Machine
**Time:** 10:25 AM -- shaded
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, side view
**Description:** Jorge turns the despulpadora crank with both hands. His strong arms work the heavy handle in steady circles. The muscles of his forearms flex with each rotation, veins standing out beneath the tanned skin. His face is set with effort but this is familiar work -- his body knows the motion. The machine grinds and processes, beans sliding out one end, pulp the other. His sombrero sits on a post nearby; his gray hair is dark with sweat.

### Scene 082: Transferring Beans to Fermentation Tank
**Time:** 10:35 AM -- shaded
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, fermentation area
**Description:** Jorge and the worker carry the trough of freshly pulped beans to the concrete fermentation tank -- a rectangular basin set into the ground, about one meter deep, lined with smooth cement. They tip the trough, and the mucilage-covered beans slide into the tank with a wet slithering sound. Water from the hillside spring pipe is directed into the tank, covering the beans. Here they will sit for 12 to 24 hours while natural fermentation breaks down the sticky mucilage. Jorge gauges the water level with a practiced eye.

### Scene 083: Marking the Fermentation Time
**Time:** 10:40 AM -- shaded
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, close-up
**Description:** Jorge takes a stub of chalk from a tin on the wall and writes on a small blackboard nailed above the fermentation tank: "Oct 15 - 10:30 AM." This records when the batch entered fermentation so he knows exactly when to check it -- timing is critical for flavor. The blackboard has earlier dates chalked and erased, ghosts of previous batches. His handwriting is blocky, farmer's letters. The chalk dust marks his calloused fingers white at the tips.

### Scene 084: Checking Yesterday's Fermentation
**Time:** 10:45 AM -- shaded
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, second fermentation tank
**Description:** Jorge moves to the second fermentation tank, which holds yesterday's batch. He plunges his hand into the murky water and scoops up a handful of beans. He rubs them between his palms -- testing the mucilage. If the beans feel rough, not slimy, the fermentation is complete. He nods with satisfaction -- these are ready to wash. The blackboard above reads yesterday's date. He calls the worker over. "Estos estan listos" -- these are ready.

### Scene 085: Opening the Washing Channel
**Time:** 10:50 AM -- shaded, warm
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, washing area
**Description:** Jorge pulls a wooden plug from the bottom of the fermentation tank, and the fermented beans begin to flow with the water through a concrete channel -- the washing canal. The channel is about 30 centimeters wide and slopes downward, carrying beans and water together. He directs the flow by adjusting a wooden gate. The beans tumble through the moving water, the last of the mucilage washing away. The water runs cloudy at first, then gradually clearer.

### Scene 086: Agitating Beans in the Channel
**Time:** 10:55 AM -- shaded
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, washing channel close-up
**Description:** Jorge uses a flat wooden paddle to agitate the beans in the washing channel. He pushes them back and forth in the running water, ensuring all mucilage is removed. The beans roll and tumble in the current. His rubber boots stand in a few inches of water that has overflowed the channel. The paddle is smooth and dark from years of handling. Clean beans are lighter in color -- pale yellow parchment visible. He scoops up a few and checks them against the light. Clean. Good.

### Scene 087: Collecting Washed Beans
**Time:** 11:00 AM -- bright, warm
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, end of washing channel
**Description:** At the end of the washing channel, a fine mesh screen catches the clean, washed beans while letting the water pass through. Jorge scoops the collected beans into a clean bucket with a wide plastic scoop. The beans are now in their parchment stage (cafe pergamino) -- pale yellow, clean, with a pleasant fresh smell. Each scoop fills the bucket with several kilos of pergamino beans. The water drains away into an irrigation channel that feeds back to the farm.

### Scene 088: Carrying Beans to Drying Patio
**Time:** 11:05 AM -- bright sun
**Setting:** Path from beneficiadero to drying patio
**Description:** Jorge carries a heavy bucket of washed pergamino beans from the beneficiadero to the drying patio (marquesina). The sun is now strong and high -- perfect drying conditions. His rubber boots crunch on the gravel path. The concrete drying patio ahead is a large flat surface, about 10 meters square, surrounded by a low wall. The blue tarps from last night have already been removed and folded by Carmen.

### Scene 089: Removing Tarps from Previous Beans
**Time:** 11:08 AM -- bright sun on patio
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Before spreading the new batch, Jorge checks the beans already drying on the patio from two days ago. They are spread in a thin, even layer across one section -- lighter in color now, drying from pale yellow toward tan. He kneels and scoops a few into his hand, bringing them close to his face. They are firming up nicely but need at least two more days. He sets them back down carefully. The sun beats down on the exposed concrete, reflecting harsh white light.

### Scene 090: Spreading Fresh Beans on Patio
**Time:** 11:12 AM -- bright midday sun
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Jorge pours the bucket of freshly washed beans onto an empty section of the drying patio. The pale pergamino beans tumble out in a heap. He takes a wide wooden rake -- a flat board on a long handle, like a large squeegee -- and begins spreading the beans into a thin, even layer. His arms sweep in long, practiced arcs, pushing the beans outward from the center. The layer should be no more than 2-3 centimeters thick for proper drying. The wet beans glisten in the sun.

### Scene 091: Raking Beans Evenly
**Time:** 11:18 AM -- bright sun
**Setting:** Drying patio, close-up on raking
**Description:** Close-up of the wooden rake pushing coffee beans across the concrete surface of the drying patio. The pale beans spread before the flat board like sand before a broom. Some beans flip and turn, exposing their different sides to the sun. The concrete surface is warm to the touch, radiating stored heat upward into the beans. Jorge's rubber boots stand at the edge of the bean layer. His shadow falls across the beans as he works. The precision of the spread matters -- uneven layers dry unevenly, creating inconsistent quality.

### Scene 092: Turning Older Beans
**Time:** 11:25 AM -- bright midday
**Setting:** Drying patio, older batch section
**Description:** Jorge moves to the section of the patio where older beans are drying. These beans are lighter, more tan-colored, having been drying for two days. He rakes through them in a different pattern -- turning them over rather than spreading. The rake lifts and flips the top layer, exposing beans from underneath to direct sunlight. This must be done every hour or two during peak sun for even drying. He works methodically, one swath at a time, covering the entire section. The beans make a dry, shuffling sound as they roll.

### Scene 093: Checking Bean Moisture by Bite
**Time:** 11:30 AM -- bright midday sun
**Setting:** Drying patio, close-up
**Description:** Jorge picks up a single bean from the older batch and places it between his back teeth. He bites down, testing its hardness. This is the traditional method for checking moisture content -- too soft means more drying needed, too hard means overdried, a slight crack with firm resistance means approaching the ideal 10-12% moisture. The bean cracks slightly under his teeth. He nods -- another day, maybe two. He spits out the fragment and wipes his lips. Behind him, the beans stretch across the patio in their neat layers, baking in the sun.

### Scene 094: Processing the Third Sack
**Time:** 11:35 AM -- midday
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, at the despulpadora
**Description:** Jorge returns to the beneficiadero to process the remaining sack of fresh cherries through the despulpadora. The worker cranks while Jorge feeds. They have found their rhythm and the work goes faster now. Sweat soaks through both their shirts. The machine grinds steadily. The trough fills with mucilage-covered beans. The red pulp piles up. The last of the morning's harvest passes through the machine. Jorge wipes his face with his handkerchief, watching the final cherries be processed.

### Scene 095: Filling the Fermentation Tank
**Time:** 11:45 AM -- midday
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, fermentation area
**Description:** The last batch of pulped beans is transferred into the fermentation tank, joining the earlier batch from this morning. Jorge adjusts the spring water flow to fully cover the beans. He stirs them gently with the wooden paddle, distributing the beans evenly. He chalks the time on the blackboard. These will ferment overnight and be washed tomorrow morning. The cycle repeats, day after day, throughout the harvest season.

### Scene 096: Cleaning the Despulpadora
**Time:** 11:50 AM -- midday
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, at the machine
**Description:** Jorge runs water through the despulpadora, flushing out remaining cherry bits and mucilage. He turns the crank slowly while pouring water through the hopper. The machine must be cleaned after each use to prevent rot and contamination. His hand wipes the hopper clean with a rag. He oils the crank pivot again. The machine is his livelihood -- maintaining it is non-negotiable. The red-painted cast iron gleams wet in the shaded light.

### Scene 097: Final Check of Drying Beans
**Time:** 11:55 AM -- bright midday sun
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Jorge makes one more pass across the drying patio, raking the fresh beans once more and turning the older batch again. The sun is directly overhead now, the patio blazingly bright. He shields his eyes with his hand and looks at the sky -- clouds building to the west as he predicted. If rain comes this afternoon, they will need to cover the beans. He leaves the rake leaning against the patio wall. The morning's work -- picking, processing, drying -- is complete.

## PART 7: LUNCH AT FINCA (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)

### Scene 098: Walking Back to the House
**Time:** 12:00 PM -- bright noon sun, hot
**Setting:** Farm path toward farmhouse
**Description:** Jorge walks slowly up the path toward the farmhouse, his step heavy with the morning's exertion. The noon sun is directly overhead, his sombrero providing a circle of shade. Sweat darkens the back of his flannel shirt. The farmhouse appears ahead at the top of the hill -- white walls, red tile roof, the porch visible with its flower pots. Smoke rises from the kitchen chimney. The farm dog bounds ahead, knowing lunch is coming. Jorge's machete swings at his hip with each tired step.

### Scene 099: Washing Hands at Porch Basin
**Time:** 12:05 PM -- bright noon, porch shade
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge stands at a metal basin on the porch, washing his hands vigorously with a bar of brown soap. The water runs reddish-brown from coffee stains and dirt. His calloused hands scrub against each other, the soap lathering over his thick fingers. He rinses, and the basin water turns murky. A cotton towel hangs on a hook beside the basin. He splashes water on his face, neck, the back of his neck, gasping slightly at the cool relief. Water drips from his mustache.

### Scene 100: Drying Face with Towel
**Time:** 12:07 PM -- porch shade
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge presses the cotton towel to his face, drying the water. He rubs the towel over his gray hair, which stands up in damp spikes. His face appears in the small mirror mounted on the porch post -- weathered, tired, but the eyes are satisfied. A good morning's work. He hangs the towel back on the hook and removes his sombrero, hanging it on the wall hook where it always goes.

### Scene 101: Removing Boots at the Door
**Time:** 12:08 PM -- porch
**Setting:** Farmhouse door
**Description:** Jorge sits on the porch bench and pulls off his green rubber boots, first right, then left. His thick socks are damp with sweat. He sets the boots upside down on the porch railing to dry -- an old habit, preventing insects and rain from getting inside. He slides his feet into alpargatas (traditional woven sandals) that wait by the door. The change from heavy rubber to light sandals brings visible relief. He wiggles his toes.

### Scene 102: Entering the Kitchen for Lunch
**Time:** 12:10 PM -- interior, warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Farmhouse kitchen
**Description:** Jorge enters the kitchen, where Carmen is at the fogon, stirring something in a large pot. The kitchen is warm and fragrant -- a rich, meaty, complex aroma fills the room. Steam rises from multiple pots on the stove. The wooden table is already set with clay plates and metal utensils. A pitcher of fresh juice sits in the center, condensation beading on its sides. The worker who helped this morning sits at the table already -- Carmen has invited him to stay for the meal, as is the custom.

### Scene 103: Carmen Serving Sancocho
**Time:** 12:12 PM -- kitchen, warm light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the stove
**Description:** Carmen ladles steaming sancocho into deep clay bowls -- a traditional hearty soup thick with chunks of meat on the bone, yuca (cassava) cut in large white pieces, plantain rounds, potato, corn on the cob sliced into wheels, and fresh cilantro sprinkled on top. The broth is golden and rich, having simmered for hours. Each bowl is generous, overflowing. She carries the bowls to the table carefully, the liquid threatening to spill. The fogon fire crackles behind her.

### Scene 104: The Lunch Spread
**Time:** 12:15 PM -- kitchen, warm light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, overhead view
**Description:** The lunch table is full: bowls of steaming sancocho, a mound of white rice on a serving plate, fried plantain slices (tajadas) golden and glistening, a plate of fresh avocado sliced in half with the seed still in one side, a small bowl of aji (hot pepper sauce), arepas warming on a clay plate, and a pitcher of lulo juice -- bright orange-green, tart and refreshing. A salt shaker and lime wedges complete the spread. It is almuerzo, the main meal of the day, and it is abundant. Jorge's pocillo of tinto sits at his place.

### Scene 105: Prayer Before Eating
**Time:** 12:16 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge, Carmen, and the young worker bow their heads. Jorge makes the sign of the cross and says a brief prayer -- "Bendice, Senor, estos alimentos" -- bless these foods. Carmen and the worker cross themselves. A moment of Catholic faith practiced daily, naturally, before every meal. The steam from the sancocho rises between their bowed heads. The food waits, fragrant and generous.

### Scene 106: First Spoonful of Sancocho
**Time:** 12:18 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge lifting a spoonful of sancocho to his mouth. The spoon holds golden broth, a chunk of tender meat falling off the bone, and a piece of soft yuca. He blows on it gently -- the soup is very hot. Steam rises from the spoon. He sips the broth first, then eats the solid pieces. His eyes close briefly with pleasure. This is Carmen's sancocho, perfected over forty years, a recipe from her own mother. Nothing in the world tastes better after a morning of hard work.

### Scene 107: Eating Rice and Plantain
**Time:** 12:22 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge spoons white rice onto his plate beside the sancocho bowl, then adds several golden tajadas (fried plantain slices) from the serving plate. He mashes a section of ripe avocado onto the rice with his fork, mixing the green flesh into the white grains. A squeeze of lime goes on top. He eats with steady appetite, alternating between spoonfuls of sancocho and bites of rice-avocado-plantain. The young worker eats with equal enthusiasm, complimenting Carmen's cooking.

### Scene 108: Drinking Lulo Juice
**Time:** 12:30 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge pours himself a glass of lulo juice from the ceramic pitcher. The juice is bright orange-green, thick and pulpy, made from the tart lulo fruit -- a distinctly Colombian flavor, citrusy and tangy. He drinks deeply, the cool liquid cutting through the rich warmth of the food. Condensation drips down the glass. He refills his glass, then offers the pitcher to the worker. The fruit is from a vine growing on their property -- another product of the finca.

### Scene 109: Conversation Over Lunch
**Time:** 12:35 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge, Carmen, and the worker talk over the meal. Jorge discusses the afternoon plan -- the drying beans need monitoring, and rain may come. The worker mentions he can return tomorrow for more picking. Carmen asks about his family -- his young wife is expecting their first child. Jorge nods sagely, offering advice in his quiet way. The conversation flows in Spanish, punctuated by the sounds of spoons in bowls and glasses being set down. The kitchen is warm, the meal nourishing, the company familiar.

### Scene 110: Second Helping of Sancocho
**Time:** 12:40 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Carmen ladles a second helping of sancocho into Jorge's bowl without being asked -- she knows his appetite after a morning in the fields. This serving has a large piece of corn on the cob and a chunk of potato that breaks apart in the broth. Jorge picks up the corn piece with his hands, biting the kernels off the cob, golden juice running down his fingers. He wipes his mustache with a napkin. The meal is substantial, restorative.

### Scene 111: Arepa with Cheese
**Time:** 12:45 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's hands splitting open a warm arepa, the corn cake yielding softly, steam escaping from its center. He places a thick slice of queso fresco inside -- the white cheese begins to soften and melt against the warm corn. He presses the arepa closed and takes a large bite. The combination of warm corn and fresh cheese is a staple, a comfort, a taste of home. Crumbs fall onto his clay plate.

### Scene 112: Finishing the Meal
**Time:** 12:50 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge pushes back from the table, the wooden chair scraping on the tile floor. His plates are clean. He drinks the last of his lulo juice, sets the glass down. He pats his stomach with one hand and thanks Carmen -- "Gracias, mija. Estuvo muy bueno." Carmen smiles and begins clearing dishes. The worker rises to leave, thanking her as well, shaking Jorge's hand. The meal has replenished what the morning's labor took.

### Scene 113: Brief Rest on the Porch
**Time:** 12:55 PM -- bright afternoon, porch shade
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge settles into the wooden rocking chair on the porch, tilting it back slightly. The afternoon sun is blazing beyond the porch shade. He removes his alpargatas and puts his bare feet up on the porch railing. His eyes close. The rocking chair creaks softly as it moves. The hammock sways in a faint breeze beside him. The farm dog sleeps curled beneath the rocking chair. Birds sing in the garden. A few minutes of rest -- the siesta tradition -- before the afternoon's work. His breathing slows, deepens.

---

## PART 8: AFTERNOON FARM WORK (1:00 PM - 3:30 PM)

### Scene 114: Waking from Brief Rest
**Time:** 1:00 PM -- bright afternoon
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge opens his eyes, the rocking chair still gently moving. He has dozed for only a few minutes, but even that brief rest helps at his age. He stretches his arms overhead, yawns, and drops his feet from the railing to the porch floor. The afternoon sun has shifted, shadows different now. The clouds to the west are taller, darker. He pushes himself up from the rocking chair, knees protesting. He slides into his alpargatas and puts on his sombrero.

### Scene 115: Putting Boots Back On
**Time:** 1:03 PM -- bright afternoon
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge pulls his rubber boots from the porch railing where they were drying upside down. He sits on the bench, pulls off his alpargatas, and works his feet into the boots. The rubber is warm from the sun. He stamps his feet on the porch floor, settling in. He buckles the machete back to his belt. Ready for the afternoon shift. He glances at the sky again -- those clouds are building. Better get to work.

### Scene 116: Checking Drying Beans -- Raking
**Time:** 1:10 PM -- bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Jorge walks to the drying patio and begins the afternoon raking cycle. He takes the wide wooden rake from where it leans against the wall and makes long, sweeping passes through the fresh beans spread this morning. They have been in direct sun for two hours now, and their surface is drier, less glossy. He turns them systematically, row by row, ensuring each bean gets equal sun exposure. The concrete radiates heat upward, so hot it stings through his boot soles.

### Scene 117: Raking the Older Batch
**Time:** 1:18 PM -- bright, clouds approaching
**Setting:** Drying patio, older section
**Description:** Jorge moves to the older batch of drying beans and rakes them as well. These beans are noticeably lighter in color -- tan, approaching the pale brown of properly dried pergamino. He picks up a handful and lets them trickle through his fingers, listening to the sound -- the drier they are, the more they click against each other like tiny pebbles. These are close to ready. Perhaps one more day if the sun holds.

### Scene 118: Inspecting Coffee Seedlings in Nursery
**Time:** 1:25 PM -- afternoon light, partly cloudy
**Setting:** Small nursery area near farmhouse
**Description:** Jorge walks to a small nursery area behind the farmhouse -- a shaded structure made of guadua bamboo poles supporting a mesh canopy that filters sunlight. Inside, dozens of small black plastic bags sit in rows, each containing a young coffee seedling. The seedlings are 15-20 centimeters tall, with small glossy leaves. Jorge crouches carefully and inspects several, checking their leaf color, looking for pests, feeling the soil moisture with his finger. These seedlings will replace older plants that have declined in productivity. He waters a few dry ones from a watering can.

### Scene 119: Watering Seedlings
**Time:** 1:30 PM -- afternoon, filtered light
**Setting:** Nursery, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge gently pouring water from a metal watering can onto the coffee seedlings in their black plastic bags. The water soaks into the dark soil, darkening it further. A seedling's small leaves tremble under the water's weight. His calloused hand steadies one seedling that tilts from the water flow. Each plant represents a future -- two years from planting, these will produce their first cherries. Four years to full production. Patience measured in years. Jorge waters each one with care.

### Scene 120: Pruning Coffee Plants
**Time:** 1:40 PM -- afternoon, clouds building
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, near the house
**Description:** Jorge walks through a section of mature coffee plants near the farmhouse, machete in hand. He identifies plants with too many vertical shoots (chupones) that steal energy from fruit-bearing branches. With precise machete strokes, he cuts the unwanted shoots at their base -- quick, clean cuts angled to shed rainwater. The severed branches fall to the ground. His experienced eye spots which branches are productive and which are parasitic. Each cut is deliberate, informed by decades of knowledge.

### Scene 121: Cutting a Sucker Branch
**Time:** 1:45 PM -- afternoon
**Setting:** Coffee plant, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's machete slicing through a thick sucker branch on a coffee plant. The blade is bright and sharp, cutting cleanly through the green wood. Sap oozes from the wound. The severed branch, thick with leaves but bearing no fruit, falls away. The remaining productive branches, heavy with green developing cherries, now receive more of the plant's energy. Jorge's grip on the machete handle is firm, his forearm muscles taut. Behind him, other pruned plants show fresh white cuts on their trunks.

### Scene 122: Inspecting for Broca
**Time:** 1:52 PM -- afternoon
**Setting:** Coffee plant, close-up on cherry
**Description:** Jorge inspects a cluster of coffee cherries closely, looking for tiny holes -- the telltale sign of la broca (coffee berry borer), a devastating pest. He picks a suspicious cherry and cuts it open with his thumbnail. The inside is clean -- white pulp, no tunneling, no tiny black beetle. He breathes relief. Broca destroyed half a neighbor's crop last year. He checks several more cherries, splitting them open. All clean. He drops the damaged cherries into the compost cloth at his belt. Constant vigilance is the price of a healthy crop.

### Scene 123: Applying Organic Fertilizer
**Time:** 2:00 PM -- afternoon, partly cloudy
**Setting:** Coffee plantation, at plant base
**Description:** Jorge carries a bucket of composted coffee pulp and organic matter -- recycled from his own processing -- to a row of coffee plants that look slightly yellowed. He scoops handfuls of the dark, rich compost and spreads it around the base of each plant, covering the root zone. The compost is dark brown, earthy-smelling, full of nutrients. He pats it down gently, forming a ring around each trunk. This natural fertilizer, made from the farm's own waste, feeds the plants that will produce next season's harvest. The cycle is complete.

### Scene 124: Walking the Property Fence
**Time:** 2:15 PM -- afternoon, cloudy
**Setting:** Farm perimeter, fence line
**Description:** Jorge walks the perimeter of his property along a barbed-wire fence, checking for damage. The fence posts are guadua bamboo -- thick green segments sunk into the ground. He tests each one by pushing against it. One post has rotted at the base and leans. He marks it mentally to repair later. The fence separates his finca from the neighbor's cattle pasture -- cows visible on the other side, munching grass. Beyond the pasture, another coffee farm covers the facing hillside. Jorge walks steadily along the fence line, rubber boots in the tall grass.

### Scene 125: Checking the Water Spring
**Time:** 2:25 PM -- afternoon, overcast
**Setting:** Hillside above the farm, spring source
**Description:** Jorge climbs a short steep path above the farm to check the natural spring that provides water to the finca. The spring emerges from a rocky hillside, clear water flowing into a concrete catchment box. He lifts the concrete lid and peers inside -- the water is clear, the intake screen free of leaves. A black plastic pipe carries water downhill to the beneficiadero and the house. He checks the pipe connections for leaks, running his hand along the joints. Everything is secure. Water is life on a farm -- for drinking, washing, processing coffee.

### Scene 126: Returning to Drying Patio
**Time:** 2:40 PM -- afternoon, clouds darkening
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Jorge returns to the drying patio for another raking cycle. The fresh beans from this morning have dried noticeably in the afternoon sun, their surface now matte rather than glossy. He rakes them in careful rows, turning the layer completely. The older beans get the same treatment. He looks up at the sky frequently -- the clouds to the west are growing tall and dark, anvil-shaped. Thunder rumbles distantly. Rain is coming, maybe within two hours. He works faster.

### Scene 127: Preparing Tarps for Rain
**Time:** 2:50 PM -- afternoon, overcast, distant thunder
**Setting:** Drying patio edge
**Description:** Jorge pulls the folded blue plastic tarps from the storage area at the patio edge and begins unfolding them, laying them flat and ready near the drying beans. If rain comes, he needs to cover the beans within minutes to prevent moisture from ruining days of careful drying. He positions heavy stones at the tarp corners, ready to be thrown over the beans at the first drop. The sky is darkening rapidly now, the light turning from bright to muted gray-green. The air pressure drops, and the breeze picks up, carrying the scent of distant rain.

### Scene 128: Sorting Dried Beans by Hand
**Time:** 3:00 PM -- overcast afternoon
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, sorting table
**Description:** Jorge moves to the beneficiadero and sits on a wooden stool at a wide sorting table. Before him, he spreads a quantity of beans from the nearly-dry batch for hand sorting. His calloused fingers pick through the beans with surprising precision -- removing defects: beans that are too small, broken, discolored, insect-damaged, or misshapen. These go into a reject pile. The good beans -- uniform in size, smooth parchment, no blemishes -- are swept into a separate container. Quality sorting is essential for getting a good price. Each defective bean, if left in, reduces the lot's grade and value.

### Scene 129: Identifying a Defective Bean
**Time:** 3:08 PM -- overcast
**Setting:** Sorting table, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's fingers holding a single coffee bean up to the light. The bean has a small dark spot -- possibly mold or insect damage. He turns it between his thumb and forefinger, examining it from all angles. His magnifying reading glasses perch on his nose for this close work. The bean is rejected -- flicked into the defect pile with a soft click. His other hand continues sweeping through the spread of beans, eyes scanning, fingers picking, a human quality-control machine refined by five decades of practice.

### Scene 130: Bagging Green Coffee
**Time:** 3:15 PM -- overcast, wind picking up
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, storage area
**Description:** Jorge scoops the sorted, highest-quality dry beans into a burlap coffee sack stamped with his farm's name and the regional cooperative logo. The beans pour from the plastic container into the sack with a dry rattling sound. He fills the sack to the proper weight, lifts it to judge -- about 70 kilos, a standard lot. He ties the top with sturdy twine, making a series of secure knots. This sack will go to the cooperative for sale, or perhaps the buyer who visited last week. Each sack represents weeks of work -- picking, processing, drying, sorting -- condensed into one portable unit of value.

### Scene 131: Recording Harvest in Notebook
**Time:** 3:22 PM -- overcast, dim light in beneficiadero
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, at a small desk
**Description:** Jorge sits on his stool at a small cluttered desk in the corner of the beneficiadero and opens a worn leather-bound notebook. He writes with a stub of pencil, recording the day's production: date, kilos of fresh cherries picked, kilos of pergamino processed, lots in fermentation, lots on the drying patio, a sack ready for sale. His handwriting is careful but blocky, a farmer's ledger. Previous pages show similar entries going back months. A basic calculator with worn buttons sits beside the notebook. He does the math on cherry-to-green conversion ratio, muttering numbers under his breath.

---

## PART 9: LATE AFTERNOON (3:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Scene 132: Rain Arriving
**Time:** 3:30 PM -- dark overcast, first drops
**Setting:** Drying patio, looking at sky
**Description:** Jorge stands at the edge of the drying patio, looking up. The first fat raindrops hit the concrete, leaving dark spots. The sky is charcoal gray, the western mountains invisible behind sheets of rain advancing across the valley like a curtain. Thunder rumbles, closer now. A flash of lightning illuminates the cloud mass. The wind gusts, scattering loose leaves across the patio. Jorge does not hesitate -- he moves immediately to the prepared tarps.

### Scene 133: Covering Beans with Tarps
**Time:** 3:32 PM -- rain beginning, wind
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Jorge throws the first blue tarp over the fresh beans, the plastic billowing in the wind before settling over the pale layer. He grabs the pre-positioned stones and places them along the edges, weighing the tarp down. Rain is falling steadily now, drumming on the tarp, on his sombrero, on the concrete beyond. He works fast, pulling the second tarp over the older batch of beans. His flannel shirt is already getting wet. The tarps must overlap at the seams to prevent any water reaching the beans.

### Scene 134: Securing Tarp Edges
**Time:** 3:35 PM -- heavy rain
**Setting:** Drying patio, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's hands placing heavy stones along the tarp edges as rain pounds down. Water cascades off his sombrero brim. His calloused fingers grip the wet plastic, tucking it under the stones. The rain is tropical -- warm, heavy, relentless. Water streams across the concrete patio around his boots. The tarps hold, the beans protected underneath. He pulls one corner tighter where the wind threatens to lift it, adding another stone. His flannel shirt is soaked, clinging to his shoulders.

### Scene 135: Running to the Beneficiadero
**Time:** 3:37 PM -- heavy rain
**Setting:** Path from patio to beneficiadero
**Description:** Jorge jogs from the drying patio to the covered beneficiadero, his rubber boots splashing through puddles already forming on the path. The rain is torrential now, a tropical downpour that reduces visibility to twenty meters. His sombrero channels water off the brim in streams. The corrugated metal roof of the beneficiadero drumming with rain is deafening as he ducks under its shelter. He shakes water from his hat, catches his breath.

### Scene 136: Watching the Rain from Beneficiadero
**Time:** 3:40 PM -- heavy rain, sheltered
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, looking outward
**Description:** Jorge leans against a post in the beneficiadero, watching the rain pour down. The landscape has transformed -- waterfalls cascade down the hillside, the coffee plants droop under the weight of water, the dirt paths are rivers of reddish mud. The drumming on the metal roof is constant and loud. He crosses his arms, patient. These afternoon rains are normal in Quindio -- part of the tropical climate that makes coffee grow so well. The rain feeds the springs, the springs feed the farm. He will wait.

### Scene 137: Rain Easing
**Time:** 4:15 PM -- light rain, brightening
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, looking outward
**Description:** The rain eases from torrential to a gentle drizzle. The sky lightens to pale gray. Drops still fall from the corrugated roof edges in a curtain of water. The air is fresh, cool, washed clean -- smelling of wet earth, vegetation, and ozone. A rainbow begins to form over the valley, arcing over the distant mountains. Jorge pushes off from the post. The worst has passed. He can resume checking on things. The coffee plants sparkle with millions of water droplets.

### Scene 138: Checking Tarps After Rain
**Time:** 4:20 PM -- drizzle stopping, gray sky
**Setting:** Drying patio
**Description:** Jorge walks back to the drying patio and checks the tarps. Water has pooled on the tarp surfaces. He lifts one edge carefully -- the beans underneath are dry, protected. He nods with satisfaction. He will leave the tarps on until he is sure the rain is finished. Water still drips from the eaves of every structure. The concrete patio is wet and steaming slightly as the last warmth of the day meets the rainwater. His boots leave wet prints as he walks.

### Scene 139: Checking Fermentation Tanks
**Time:** 4:30 PM -- gray, humid afternoon
**Setting:** Beneficiadero, fermentation area
**Description:** Jorge checks the fermentation tanks in the beneficiadero. Rainwater has not entered -- the roof protected them. He stirs the fermenting beans with the wooden paddle, checking the progress. The water is slightly cloudy, tiny bubbles rising -- fermentation is active, the natural process working. He checks the thermometer mounted on the tank wall -- the temperature is in the right range. He records the reading in his notebook. These beans will be ready to wash tomorrow morning.

### Scene 140: Walking the Property After Rain
**Time:** 4:40 PM -- gray sky, wet landscape
**Setting:** Farm path, post-rain
**Description:** Jorge walks through the property, doing his post-rain inspection. The dirt paths are muddy, his boots sinking and squelching. He checks for any drainage problems -- water must flow away from the coffee plant roots, not pool around them. A small gully has formed where runoff concentrated. He'll need to redirect it later. The coffee plants are glistening, refreshed by the rain. The banana trees and plantains drip steadily. A frog croaks from somewhere in the wet vegetation. The Andes mountains are emerging from the clouds, their peaks catching the last gray light.

### Scene 141: Feeding Chickens -- Evening
**Time:** 4:50 PM -- late afternoon, overcast
**Setting:** Chicken coop
**Description:** Jorge makes his way to the chicken coop for the evening feeding. The chickens cluck noisily, having been confined during the rain. He opens the coop door and scatters corn and feed from a metal bucket onto the wet ground. The hens rush out, pecking eagerly at the feed, their feathers slightly ruffled and damp. The rooster struts among them, asserting his authority. Jorge collects two late-afternoon eggs from the nesting boxes, warm in his palm, and places them in a small basket.

### Scene 142: Checking the Pigs
**Time:** 4:55 PM -- late afternoon
**Setting:** Pig pen
**Description:** Jorge walks to the pig pen and checks on his two pigs, who have sheltered in their wooden lean-to during the rain. They grunt and emerge, expecting food. He pours a bucket of kitchen scraps and grain into their trough. The pigs push their snouts in, eating eagerly and noisily. Jorge checks their water trough -- full from the rain. The pen is muddy, the pigs' feet caked with it. He leans on the wooden fence, watching them eat, satisfied that all his animals are well.

---

## PART 10: END OF WORK DAY (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

### Scene 143: Closing the Chicken Coop
**Time:** 5:00 PM -- late afternoon, gray sky
**Setting:** Chicken coop
**Description:** Jorge closes the chicken coop door for the night, sliding the wooden latch into place. The chickens are settling onto their roosts inside, clucking softly. The rooster takes his high perch. Jorge checks the latch twice -- foxes and opossums are a constant threat. Through the wire mesh, the chickens arrange themselves for the night. He places the egg basket on the ground to carry back to the house.

### Scene 144: Cleaning the Machete
**Time:** 5:05 PM -- late afternoon
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch, work area
**Description:** Jorge sits on the porch bench and draws the machete from its sheath. He wipes the blade with an oiled rag, cleaning off sap and moisture from the day's pruning work. The steel gleams as he runs the rag along its length. He inspects the edge -- still sharp, but it will need honing tomorrow. He slides the machete back into the leather sheath and hangs it on its wall hook. The rag goes into a tin can of oil on the porch shelf. A daily ritual of tool care that keeps the machete functional and rust-free.

### Scene 145: Removing Boots
**Time:** 5:10 PM -- early evening light
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge sits on the porch bench and pulls off his rubber boots. He turns each one upside down, knocking the soles against the bench leg to dislodge caked mud. Red clay falls in clumps onto the porch floor. He sets the boots upside down on the railing again to dry overnight. His thick socks are damp and he peels them off, draping them over the railing beside the boots. His bare feet are pale compared to his tanned arms, the skin wrinkled from hours in rubber.

### Scene 146: Alpargatas and Walking Inside
**Time:** 5:12 PM -- early evening
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch to main room
**Description:** Jorge slides his feet into the alpargatas -- traditional woven fiber sandals with a flat sole and woven top. The light sandals are a relief after the heavy boots. He picks up the egg basket and walks into the farmhouse, the alpargatas shuffling softly on the tile floor. He sets the basket of two eggs on the kitchen counter where Carmen will find them. The kitchen is quiet now, the fogon burning low.

### Scene 147: Washing at the Basin
**Time:** 5:15 PM -- early evening light
**Setting:** Farmhouse bathroom/wash area
**Description:** Jorge stands at a simple concrete wash basin in the small bathroom area adjacent to the bedroom. He splashes water on his face, arms, and the back of his neck, scrubbing vigorously with a bar of brown soap. The water runs down his forearms, brown with the day's accumulated dirt and coffee stain. He scrubs his hands especially hard -- the coffee stain never fully comes out, but the worst of the day's grime does. A small mirror on the wall reflects his tired, damp face. A clean cotton towel hangs on a nail.

### Scene 148: Drying Off
**Time:** 5:18 PM -- early evening
**Setting:** Wash area
**Description:** Jorge dries his face and arms with the clean towel, rubbing his gray hair until it stands up in every direction. He catches his reflection in the small mirror and half-smiles at the disheveled image. His face is drawn with fatigue, the wrinkles deeper in the evening light, but his brown eyes hold quiet satisfaction. A day of honest labor done well. He hangs the towel on the nail.

### Scene 149: Changing to Home Clothes
**Time:** 5:22 PM -- early evening
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Jorge changes out of his sweat-stained work clothes in the bedroom. He unbuttons the damp plaid flannel shirt and hangs it over the wooden chair back to dry. He pulls off the worn jeans and hangs them beside the shirt. From the wardrobe, he takes a clean but simple cotton shirt -- white, collarless, soft from countless washes -- and looser cotton pants. He pulls them on. The fresh fabric feels good on his clean skin. He leaves the alpargatas on. He is transformed from farmer to home man, the same person in different skin.

### Scene 150: Checking the Farm from the Porch
**Time:** 5:30 PM -- early evening, golden light breaking through clouds
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge steps onto the porch in his clean home clothes, the air fresh and cool after the rain. The clouds have parted in the west, and the setting sun sends golden light across the wet landscape. Everything gleams -- the coffee leaves, the puddles on the path, the tile roof. He stands at the porch railing, hands resting on the damp wood, and surveys his finca. The drying patio tarps are secure. The chicken coop is latched. The beneficiadero stands quiet. The coffee rows stretch down the hillside, clean and green from the rain. His land. His life's work.

---

## PART 11: EVENING AT HOME (6:00 PM - 7:30 PM)

### Scene 151: Sunset From the Porch
**Time:** 6:00 PM -- golden sunset
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch, facing west
**Description:** Jorge sits in his wooden rocking chair on the porch, gently rocking. The sunset is spectacular -- the clouds from the afternoon rain are now lit from below in shades of orange, pink, purple, and gold. The Andes mountain peaks are silhouetted against the blazing sky. The wet coffee plantation below glows golden. Jorge watches in quiet contemplation, his hands resting on the rocking chair arms. He has watched ten thousand sunsets from this porch, and each one is different. This one, with the rain-washed air and dramatic clouds, is particularly beautiful.

### Scene 152: Carmen Joins on the Porch
**Time:** 6:05 PM -- sunset fading to dusk
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Carmen comes through the door carrying two small cups of evening tinto and sits in the rocking chair beside Jorge. She hands him one of the metal pocillos. They sit together, rocking gently, watching the last colors drain from the sky. The air cools as the sun drops behind the mountains. Fireflies begin to appear in the garden, tiny points of green light. The farm dog lies between their chairs. They exchange a few quiet words -- about the rain, the harvest, whether their daughter will call tonight. The ease of a couple married for over forty years.

### Scene 153: Drinking Evening Tinto
**Time:** 6:10 PM -- dusk
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's weathered hand holding the small metal pocillo of tinto, steam curling from the dark surface. His calloused fingers wrap around the warm cup. The light is fading -- his face is lit by the last remnant of sunset glow and the warm light spilling from the kitchen window behind him. He sips slowly, not hurrying. The coffee is from his own farm, processed with his own hands, brewed by his wife. From plant to cup, every step was his. There is a deep contentment in this that no words express.

### Scene 154: Neighbor Arriving
**Time:** 6:20 PM -- dusk
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch, view of path
**Description:** A figure appears on the path leading up to the farmhouse -- Don Rodrigo, a neighboring farmer, perhaps ten years younger than Jorge. He walks with a cane, wearing his own straw hat, a vest over a work shirt. "Buenas tardes, vecino!" he calls out. Jorge rises from the rocking chair to greet him. They shake hands warmly, pat each other on the shoulder. Don Rodrigo has come to discuss selling some dried beans to a buyer who will visit the area next week. Carmen offers to bring him coffee.

### Scene 155: Discussing Coffee Prices
**Time:** 6:25 PM -- dusk, porch light on
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch
**Description:** Jorge and Don Rodrigo sit in the rocking chairs, talking business. Jorge has pulled a handful of dried pergamino beans from a small sample bag he keeps on the porch shelf. He holds them out for Rodrigo to examine. They discuss prices -- the international market is fluctuating, but the regional cooperative offers stable rates for good quality. Carmen brings a third pocillo of tinto for the neighbor. The porch light -- a single yellow bulb -- casts warm light on the two old farmers, their straw hats on the railing beside them, their conversation a mixture of market talk and neighborly gossip.

### Scene 156: Neighbor Departing
**Time:** 6:40 PM -- early night, dark
**Setting:** Farmhouse porch, view of departing figure
**Description:** Don Rodrigo rises to leave, adjusting his straw hat. He and Jorge shake hands again, agreeing to speak before the buyer arrives. "Hasta manana, Don Jorge." "Que le vaya bien, compadre." Rodrigo walks down the dark path, his cane tapping, a flashlight flickering on in his hand. Jorge watches until the light disappears around the bend. He turns to Carmen. "Good man, that Rodrigo." She nods and collects the empty cups.

### Scene 157: Dinner Preparation
**Time:** 6:45 PM -- evening, kitchen light
**Setting:** Farmhouse kitchen
**Description:** Carmen stands at the fogon, preparing dinner. The wood stove is burning well, two pots on top. She reheats rice and beans left from lunch (calentado -- a beloved Colombian tradition of reheated leftovers). On a griddle, she fries eggs -- two for Jorge, one for herself. Arepas warm on the side of the stove. Jorge enters the kitchen and sits at the wooden table, watching her work. The kitchen is lit by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling beam, casting warm yellow light. The window is dark -- night has fallen over the mountains.

### Scene 158: Frying Eggs
**Time:** 6:50 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the fogon, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of eggs frying in a cast-iron skillet on the fogon. Two eggs sizzle in a thin layer of oil, their whites setting and browning at the edges, yolks still runny and golden. Carmen's hand holds the skillet handle. The cast iron is blackened from decades of use. The heat from the wood fire is uneven but she knows her stove perfectly -- she tilts the pan to pool oil over the yolks, basting them. The aroma of frying eggs mixes with the wood smoke.

### Scene 159: Dinner on the Table
**Time:** 6:55 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Carmen sets the dinner plates on the table: calentado -- reheated rice and beans, thick and hearty -- with two fried eggs on top of Jorge's portion, their yolks glistening. Warm arepas on a clay plate. A cup of aguapanela, warm and amber, steams beside each plate. A small bottle of aji (hot sauce) sits in the center of the table. The meal is simple -- campo food, farmer's dinner -- but deeply satisfying. Jorge picks up his fork.

### Scene 160: Breaking the Egg Yolk
**Time:** 6:57 PM -- kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's fork piercing the yolk of a fried egg atop the mound of calentado. The golden yolk breaks and runs in a stream over the rice and beans, coating them in rich, liquid gold. He mixes the egg into the calentado with his fork, creating a rich, satisfying combination. The beans are dark red, the rice white, the egg yellow -- a colorful plate. He scoops a large forkful and eats. His eyes close briefly. Simple. Perfect.

### Scene 161: Eating Dinner Together
**Time:** 7:00 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge and Carmen eat dinner together at the wooden table. The single bulb casts a warm cone of light over the table, leaving the kitchen corners in soft shadow. They eat slowly, talking between bites. Carmen mentions their son called earlier while Jorge was in the fields -- he is coming to visit this weekend with the grandchildren. Jorge's face brightens at the news. He tears his arepa and uses it to scoop up the last of the egg and calentado from his plate. The night insects have begun their chorus outside the dark window.

### Scene 162: Drinking Aguapanela
**Time:** 7:10 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Jorge wraps both hands around his warm cup of aguapanela and drinks deeply. The sweet panela drink is comforting on the cool mountain evening. Carmen clears the dishes to the wash basin, stacking them quietly. Jorge leans back in his chair, the meal settling, warmth spreading through him. He watches Carmen move around the kitchen -- the same movements she has made for forty years, still efficient, still graceful. He feels a wave of gratitude he does not express in words.

### Scene 163: Moving to Main Room
**Time:** 7:15 PM -- evening, interior light
**Setting:** Farmhouse main room
**Description:** Jorge rises from the kitchen table and walks into the main room, which serves as the living area. The room is simple: a worn sofa against one wall, a wooden bench, a small side table, and most importantly, an old battery-powered radio on a shelf. A religious calendar -- the Virgin Mary for this month -- hangs on the whitewashed wall. A crucifix is mounted above the doorway. The room is lit by a single bulb. Jorge settles onto the sofa, his body grateful for the soft cushion after a day of physical labor.

### Scene 164: Turning on the Radio
**Time:** 7:18 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Main room, close-up on radio
**Description:** Jorge reaches over to the small side table and turns the dial on the old radio. It is a simple transistor radio, its brown plastic case cracked and taped, the antenna extended at an angle. Static crackles, then a voice emerges -- Caracol Radio, the Colombian national station, broadcasting the evening news. The announcer's voice fills the small room with reports from Bogota, coffee prices, weather forecasts, regional news. Jorge adjusts the dial slightly, tuning in more clearly. This is his connection to the world beyond the finca.

### Scene 165: Listening to News
**Time:** 7:20 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Main room
**Description:** Jorge sits on the sofa, legs stretched out on a low wooden footstool, listening to the radio news. His head is tilted slightly toward the radio, brow furrowed in concentration. The announcer discusses coffee export prices -- Jorge listens intently to this segment. Coffee is his livelihood, and international prices directly affect what the cooperative will pay for his beans. He nods at some piece of information, frowns at another. His hands rest on his stomach, fingers interlaced.

### Scene 166: Carmen Knitting
**Time:** 7:25 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Main room
**Description:** Carmen sits in a wooden chair across from Jorge, knitting. Her hands work the needles with practiced speed -- click, click, click -- the yarn flowing between her fingers. She is making a small sweater for a grandchild, bright yellow wool forming even rows. A ball of yarn sits in a basket at her feet. She listens to the radio too, occasionally commenting on a news item. The lamplight catches the needles as they flash. A pair of reading glasses perch on her nose. The domestic scene is timeless -- an elderly couple, each absorbed in their evening activity, together in comfortable companionship.

### Scene 167: Jorge Reading Newspaper
**Time:** 7:30 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Main room
**Description:** Jorge unfolds a newspaper -- La Cronica del Quindio, the regional paper, a few days old from his last trip to the town of Armenia. He puts on his reading glasses, heavy black frames, and holds the paper at arm's length. He reads slowly, lips moving slightly, scanning headlines about local politics, agricultural subsidies, and a piece about the upcoming coffee festival. The newspaper is creased and slightly damp from being carried in his pocket. Carmen's knitting needles continue their rhythm. The radio plays vallenato music now -- an accordion-driven melody, the folk music of Colombia.

### Scene 168: Talking About Grandchildren
**Time:** 7:40 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Main room
**Description:** Jorge sets down the newspaper and looks at Carmen. He brings up the grandchildren -- little Sofia is five now, learning to read. And Mateo, the baby, must be walking by now. His face softens when he talks about them, the weathered features gentling. Carmen smiles, her needles pausing. She tells him Sofia drew a picture of the finca last time she visited -- coffee plants and a rooster. Jorge chuckles, a low warm sound. The distance between rural Quindio and the city where his children live is small in kilometers but large in lifestyle. These weekend visits are the highlight of their month.

### Scene 169: Checking the Farm from Window
**Time:** 7:50 PM -- night
**Setting:** Main room, at the window
**Description:** Jorge rises from the sofa and walks to the window, looking out into the dark. The porch light illuminates a small circle -- the porch railing, the nearest flower pots, the edge of the path. Beyond is darkness, but Jorge knows every contour of his land in the dark. He can make out the silhouette of the beneficiadero roof, the pale rectangle of the drying patio tarps. Fireflies drift in the garden. The night insects are loud -- crickets, frogs, the distant hoot of an owl. Everything is as it should be. His farm sleeps.

## PART 12: BEDTIME (7:30 PM - 9:00 PM)

### Scene 170: Evening Prayer Together
**Time:** 8:00 PM -- evening, candlelight
**Setting:** Bedroom, at the altar
**Description:** Jorge and Carmen stand together before the small home altar in the bedroom corner. Carmen has lit the half-melted white candle in its tin holder, and its flame flickers, casting dancing shadows on the whitewashed wall and illuminating the ceramic Virgin Mary statue. Both make the sign of the cross. Jorge prays aloud in a low murmur -- thanking God for the harvest, the rain, the health to work another day, asking blessings for their children and grandchildren. Carmen joins in on the familiar phrases. Their clasped hands, both weathered with age, are joined in the candlelight.

### Scene 171: Blowing Out the Candle
**Time:** 8:05 PM -- bedroom, dim
**Setting:** Bedroom, altar close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's face as he leans forward and blows out the altar candle. The flame wavers, bends, and goes out, a thin trail of smoke curling upward past the Virgin Mary statue. The room dims to the single overhead bulb. The palm frond beside the statue casts a shadow on the wall. Carmen touches the statue gently as she turns away -- a small gesture of reverence. The evening prayer is complete, as it has been every night of their married life.

### Scene 172: Bathroom Routine -- Washing Face
**Time:** 8:10 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Farmhouse bathroom/wash area
**Description:** Jorge stands at the simple concrete wash basin in the bathroom, splashing warm water on his face. He scrubs with a bar of soap, the lather foaming in his gray mustache and eyebrows. The small mirror shows his tired face, eyes slightly reddened from a day in sun and wind. Water drips from his chin into the basin. A clean towel hangs on the nail, ready. The bathroom is small and basic -- concrete floor, whitewashed walls, a single showerhead in one corner, a toilet, the basin.

### Scene 173: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 8:13 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Bathroom, at basin
**Description:** Jorge brushes his teeth with a well-used toothbrush, the bristles splayed slightly. He squeezes toothpaste from a tube that is squeezed flat from the middle -- a domestic detail. He brushes methodically, leaning over the basin, foam gathering at the corners of his mouth. His reflection in the small mirror shows the familiar routine. He spits, rinses, runs his tongue over his teeth. He places the toothbrush in a ceramic cup beside the basin, next to Carmen's pink one.

### Scene 174: Carmen in the Bathroom
**Time:** 8:16 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Bathroom doorway
**Description:** Jorge passes Carmen in the narrow hallway outside the bathroom. She carries her own toiletry items -- a cotton washcloth, a jar of face cream. They exchange a brief word as they pass. He goes to the bedroom; she enters the bathroom. The domestic choreography of shared space, performed without thought, smooth from decades of repetition.

### Scene 175: Changing into Sleep Clothes
**Time:** 8:18 PM -- evening, bedroom
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Jorge changes into his sleep clothes in the bedroom -- a clean white undershirt and loose cotton pants, the same simple outfit he wakes in each morning. He folds his clean home shirt and pants onto the wooden chair, where they will wait for tomorrow evening. The wardrobe door is open, showing the neat, spare contents. The colorful cobija on the bed has been turned down by Carmen earlier. The old alarm clock on the nightstand ticks steadily.

### Scene 176: Setting the Alarm
**Time:** 8:20 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Bedroom, nightstand close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Jorge's calloused hand reaching to the old wind-up alarm clock on the wooden nightstand. He winds the key on the back with several turns -- the mechanical spring tensing inside. He checks that the alarm hand points to 4:30 -- half an hour before dawn. The clock face is yellowed with age, the numbers faded, the glass slightly cracked. It has woken him every morning for thirty years. Beside the clock, a glass of water and his reading glasses wait. The framed image of the Virgen del Carmen watches from the wall above.

### Scene 177: Checking the Window
**Time:** 8:22 PM -- evening
**Setting:** Bedroom, at the window
**Description:** Jorge walks to the small bedroom window and looks out into the darkness. The rain has stopped entirely, and the sky has cleared. Stars are appearing -- thick, brilliant, the Milky Way visible in a way that is impossible in the city. He can see the dark outline of the mountains against the star-filled sky. The air coming through the window is cool and fresh, carrying the scent of wet earth and night-blooming flowers. No light pollution for kilometers -- just the vast Colombian sky. He leaves the window cracked open for air and pulls the simple cotton curtain across.

### Scene 178: Getting into Bed
**Time:** 8:25 PM -- evening, dim light
**Setting:** Bedroom, side view
**Description:** Jorge pulls back the colorful cobija and white sheet and lowers himself into the simple wooden bed. The mattress is old but comfortable, conforming to his body in familiar ways. He pulls the sheet up to his waist and the cobija over his legs. The bed frame creaks softly as he shifts to find his position. He lies on his right side, the position he always sleeps in. The pillow is thin and flat, cotton-covered. The nightstand lamp casts a warm glow over the bed.

### Scene 179: Carmen Getting into Bed
**Time:** 8:30 PM -- evening, warm lamplight
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Carmen enters the bedroom in her nightgown -- white cotton, embroidered at the neckline, reaching her ankles. Her gray hair is unbound, falling past her shoulders, brushed smooth. She sets her reading glasses and a small prayer book on her side of the nightstand. She lifts the cobija and gets into bed beside Jorge, the bed shifting with her weight. She adjusts the pillow, pulls the blanket to her chest. The familiar routine of settling in.

### Scene 180: Carmen Reading Prayer Book
**Time:** 8:33 PM -- evening, lamplight
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on Carmen
**Description:** Carmen sits propped against her pillow, reading glasses on, paging through a small, well-worn prayer book. The leather cover is soft and cracked, the pages thin and yellowed. She reads silently, her lips moving occasionally with a familiar prayer. The lamplight falls across the page. Jorge lies beside her, eyes open, watching the ceiling, his mind reviewing the day -- the cherries picked, the beans fermenting, the rain, the conversation with Rodrigo. His thoughts slow as tiredness overtakes him.

### Scene 181: Jorge Turning Off the Lamp
**Time:** 8:40 PM -- evening to darkness
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Jorge reaches over to the nightstand and clicks off the small lamp. The room plunges into darkness, except for the starlight coming through the cracked window and the faintest glow of the moon. Carmen sets down her prayer book and removes her glasses in the dark, placing them on the nightstand by feel. The sheets rustle as they both settle deeper into the bed. "Buenas noches, viejo," Carmen murmurs. "Buenas noches, mija," Jorge replies. His voice is thick with approaching sleep.

### Scene 182: The Farm Sleeps
**Time:** 9:00 PM -- night, starlight
**Setting:** Bedroom, then exterior view
**Description:** Jorge and Carmen sleep in their bed under the colorful cobija, their forms still in the darkness. Through the cracked window, stars blaze in the clear mountain sky. The old alarm clock ticks on the nightstand, counting the hours until 4:30 AM. Outside, the finca is quiet: the chickens roost in their coop, the pigs sleep in their shelter, the coffee beans ferment silently in their tanks, the drying beans rest under their tarps. The mist begins to reform in the valley, a white river of fog flowing between the dark hills. Crickets and frogs sing the night song of the tropics. In a few hours, the rooster will crow, the alarm will ring, and the cycle will begin again. The land rests, and the farmer rests with it.
