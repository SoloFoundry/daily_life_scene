# A Day in the Life of Jorge: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Jorge, a 67-year-old Colombian coffee farmer living in rural Quindío, in the heart of Colombia's Coffee Triangle (Eje Cafetero).

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in real-world settings (coffee beans on the plant, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Rural Colombian/agricultural vocabulary rarely covered in traditional materials
- Cultural context embedded naturally (Colombian coffee culture)
- Elderly male perspective for diversity
