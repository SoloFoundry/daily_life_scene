## PART 1: EARLY MORNING -- BEDROOM (5:30 AM - 6:00 AM)

### Scene 001: Pre-Dawn Bedroom
**Time:** 5:30 AM -- dark room, faint gray light at window edges
**Setting:** Lucia and Andres's bedroom, wide view from doorway
**Description:** A modern apartment bedroom in Bucaramanga is still and quiet in the pre-dawn darkness. A 28-year-old Colombian woman with light olive skin and dark brown shoulder-length hair sleeps on the left side of a queen bed with white and mint green bedding. Her thin black rectangular glasses sit folded on the wooden nightstand beside a stack of three novels and a reading lamp. On the other nightstand, a digital alarm clock glows 5:30 in red numbers. Her partner Andres, a 30-year-old man with short dark hair, sleeps on the right side, an architecture magazine resting face-down on his nightstand. A ceiling fan turns slowly overhead. Through the window, the faint outline of Bucaramanga's hills is barely visible against the gray-blue sky. A small potted fern sits on the windowsill.

### Scene 002: Alarm Sounds
**Time:** 5:30 AM -- dark room, alarm clock glowing
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on nightstand and bed
**Description:** The digital alarm clock on the wooden nightstand flashes 5:30 and emits its buzzing tone. Lucia's hand emerges from the white and mint green covers, reaching toward the nightstand. Her dark brown hair is spread across the pillow. Her glasses sit folded beside the alarm. The reading lamp is off. Andres stirs slightly beside her, pulling the covers higher. The room is dark except for the red glow of the alarm numbers and the faintest gray light at the curtain edges.

### Scene 003: Turning Off Alarm
**Time:** 5:31 AM -- dark room with alarm glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** Lucia's hand presses the button on top of the digital alarm clock, silencing the buzzing. Her fingers are slender, a simple silver ring on her right hand. The red numbers now show 5:31. Her stack of novels is visible beside the clock -- the top one has a colorful cover with a bookmark sticking out. Her folded glasses rest between the books and the alarm. The reading lamp stands behind them, its shade slightly tilted.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 5:32 AM -- faint gray-blue light through curtains
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Lucia sits up slowly in bed, the white and mint green blanket pooling around her waist. She wears a light cotton pajama top with a small floral print in pink and green and solid lavender pajama pants. Her dark brown shoulder-length hair is messy from sleep, falling across her face. She rubs her right eye with the back of her hand. Her left hand rests on the mattress. Andres still sleeps beside her, face turned away. The ceiling fan spins slowly above. Faint gray-blue light begins to creep past the curtains.

### Scene 005: Reaching for Glasses
**Time:** 5:33 AM -- faint morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on Lucia and nightstand
**Description:** Lucia reaches to the nightstand and picks up her thin black rectangular glasses, unfolding them carefully. She slides them onto her face, the dark frames settling on the bridge of her nose. The world comes into focus. Her small gold stud earrings catch the faint light. The stack of novels, the reading lamp, and the now-silent alarm clock are all within arm's reach. She blinks, adjusting to being awake, her floral pajama top slightly rumpled.

### Scene 006: Feet on the Floor
**Time:** 5:34 AM -- growing gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, low angle at bed
**Description:** Lucia swings her legs over the edge of the bed, her bare feet touching the cool tile floor. She wears lavender pajama pants that bunch slightly at her ankles. Her floral pajama top hangs loosely. She sits on the edge of the bed for a moment, hands resting on her knees, dark brown hair falling past her shoulders. The small woven rug beside the bed is just out of reach of her feet. Through the window behind her, the Bucaramanga hills are becoming more visible as dawn approaches. The potted fern on the windowsill is a dark silhouette.

### Scene 007: Standing and Stretching
**Time:** 5:35 AM -- soft gray morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, full view of Lucia
**Description:** Lucia stands beside the bed and stretches her arms overhead, fingers interlaced, arching her back slightly. Her floral pajama top rides up just a bit. Her dark brown hair hangs loosely around her shoulders. Her thin black glasses sit on her face. She yawns widely, eyes squeezing shut for a moment. The queen bed behind her has the covers pushed back on her side. Andres's side is still neatly covered, his sleeping form visible. The ceiling fan turns above. The digital alarm clock reads 5:35.

### Scene 008: Picking Up Phone
**Time:** 5:36 AM -- soft gray light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Lucia picks up her smartphone from the nightstand, the screen lighting up her face with a blue-white glow. She checks the time and scrolls briefly -- a few notifications from a teacher's group chat. Her thin black glasses reflect the screen light. She stands beside the bed in her floral pajama top and lavender pants, one hand holding the phone, the other pushing hair behind her ear. The reading lamp, novels, and glasses case sit on the nightstand beside her.

### Scene 009: Walking to Bathroom
**Time:** 5:37 AM -- gray morning light in hallway
**Setting:** Apartment hallway, view from bedroom door toward bathroom
**Description:** Lucia walks down the short apartment hallway toward the bathroom door. She is in her floral pajama top and lavender pants, bare feet on the tile floor. Her dark brown hair is still messy from sleep. Her thin black glasses are on her face. The hallway has pale cream walls and a small framed landscape painting. A thin strip of gray morning light comes from the bathroom's frosted window ahead. She carries nothing, one hand trailing along the wall as she walks.

## PART 2: BATHROOM MORNING ROUTINE (5:37 AM - 6:05 AM)

### Scene 010: Entering Bathroom
**Time:** 5:37 AM -- bright overhead light flicks on
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom, wide view from door
**Description:** Lucia flips the light switch as she enters the bathroom, bright overhead light flooding the space. The bathroom has light gray tile floors, a shower with a glass door, a single sink with a countertop, and a mirror cabinet above. On the counter sits her glasses case (open and empty since she is wearing them), a small basket of hair ties and clips, a makeup bag, a hand soap dispenser, and a cup holding two toothbrushes -- one blue (Andres's) and one purple (hers). A towel rack holds two clean towels, one white and one light blue. A small frosted window lets in a hint of gray dawn light.

### Scene 011: Washing Face
**Time:** 5:38 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink facing mirror
**Description:** Lucia stands at the sink, her thin black glasses set aside on the counter next to the glasses case. She cups water in both hands from the running faucet and splashes it onto her face. Water drips from her chin and cheeks. Her eyes are closed, dark brown hair pushed back from her forehead. The mirror reflects her face and the bright bathroom light. The hand soap dispenser stands beside the faucet. Water droplets dot the counter surface.

### Scene 012: Drying Face with Towel
**Time:** 5:39 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Lucia pats her face dry with the white towel from the rack, pressing the soft fabric against her cheeks and forehead. Her eyes are still closed as she dries. Water spots remain on the counter. Her glasses sit on the counter beside the glasses case. Her dark brown hair is slightly damp at the hairline. The purple toothbrush and blue toothbrush stand in their cup beside the sink.

### Scene 013: Putting Glasses Back On
**Time:** 5:40 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up at counter and mirror
**Description:** Lucia picks up her thin black rectangular glasses from the counter and slides them back onto her face, settling them on the bridge of her nose with both hands. She looks at her reflection in the mirror -- face clean, hair messy, pajamas rumpled. She adjusts the glasses slightly with one finger on the bridge. Her small gold stud earrings are visible. The glasses case sits open on the counter. The basket of hair ties and clips is nearby.

### Scene 014: Applying Toothpaste
**Time:** 5:41 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up at sink
**Description:** Lucia holds her purple toothbrush in one hand and squeezes a stripe of white toothpaste from the tube onto the bristles with the other. The toothpaste tube is a standard white and blue tube. She holds the brush at an angle, carefully applying just the right amount. The blue toothbrush (Andres's) remains in the cup. The faucet drips a single drop of water. The mirror reflects her focused expression.

### Scene 015: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 5:42 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Lucia brushes her teeth, the purple toothbrush moving back and forth in her mouth. White foam gathers at the corners of her lips. She watches her reflection in the mirror, her thin black glasses slightly foggy from her breath. She holds the toothbrush with her right hand, her left hand resting on the edge of the counter. Her floral pajama top is visible in the mirror. The faucet runs a thin stream of water.

### Scene 016: Rinsing Mouth
**Time:** 5:44 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Lucia cups water in her hand from the faucet and rinses her mouth, leaning over the sink and spitting. She rinses again, then wipes her lips with the back of her hand. The purple toothbrush goes back into the cup beside the blue one. She turns off the faucet with a twist of the handle. The counter has small water splashes. She straightens up and checks her teeth in the mirror with a quick smile.

### Scene 017: Removing Pajama Top (Changing)
**Time:** 5:46 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at towel rack area
**Description:** Lucia removes the hair tie from the basket on the counter and gathers her dark brown shoulder-length hair into a quick ponytail, twisting the elastic band around it twice. Loose strands frame her face. She checks the ponytail in the mirror, adjusting the height. Her thin black glasses sit on her face. Her floral pajama top is still on. The basket still holds several colorful hair ties and a few metal clips.

### Scene 018: Hair in Ponytail
**Time:** 5:47 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Lucia examines her ponytail in the mirror, turning her head left and right. The dark brown hair is gathered neatly at the back of her head with a black elastic band. A few shorter strands fall near her temples. She smooths them back with her fingers. Her thin black rectangular glasses frame her brown eyes. Her small gold stud earrings are now more visible with her hair pulled back. She nods at her reflection, satisfied with the ponytail for teaching.

### Scene 019: Applying Light Makeup
**Time:** 5:49 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at mirror close-up
**Description:** Lucia opens her small makeup bag on the counter and pulls out a compact of pressed powder. She opens the compact, looks in its small mirror, and applies a light dusting of powder across her nose and cheeks with a round sponge pad. The makeup is subtle, just evening out her light olive skin tone. The makeup bag also holds a tube of lip balm and a mascara wand. She works quickly and efficiently -- this is a daily routine, not fussy primping.

### Scene 020: Applying Lip Balm
**Time:** 5:51 AM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on face
**Description:** Lucia uncaps a tube of tinted lip balm and applies it to her lips, pressing them together afterward. The color is a natural rosy pink, subtle and professional. She checks the result in the mirror, turning her face slightly. Her thin black glasses, ponytail, gold stud earrings, and light olive skin make up her daily look. She caps the lip balm and drops it back into the makeup bag, zipping it closed.

### Scene 021: Leaving Bathroom
**Time:** 5:53 AM -- bathroom light behind, hallway dim
**Setting:** Bathroom doorway looking into hallway
**Description:** Lucia steps out of the bathroom into the hallway, flipping the light switch off behind her. The hallway is dim with early morning gray light. She is still in her floral pajama top and lavender pants, but her hair is now in a neat ponytail and her face is freshly washed with light makeup. Her thin black glasses are on. She heads back toward the bedroom to get dressed for school. Her bare feet are quiet on the cool tile.

On Andres's side: button-down shirts, slacks, and a hard hat on the top shelf. Lucia surveys her options, one hand on the closet door, the other on her hip. She is still in her pajamas. Andres is sitting up in bed behind her, rubbing his eyes.

### Scene 023: Selecting a Blouse
**Time:** 5:54 AM -- bedroom light on
**Setting:** Bedroom, at closet close-up
**Description:** Lucia pulls a light blue blouse from a hanger in the closet, holding it up and examining it. The blouse has short sleeves, a modest neckline, and small white buttons down the front.

A pair of black comfortable flats sits on the closet floor below.

### Scene 024: Selecting Pants
**Time:** 5:55 AM -- bedroom light on
**Setting:** Bedroom, at closet
**Description:** Lucia pulls a pair of black pants from a hanger. They are straight-leg, professional, with a simple waistband. She drapes them over her arm along with the light blue blouse.

A small wicker basket in the closet holds folded scarves and a light gray cardigan.

### Scene 025: Getting Dressed
**Time:** 5:57 AM -- bedroom light on
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed area
**Description:** Lucia has changed into her teaching outfit: the light blue blouse tucked neatly into black pants, the small white buttons fastened. She sits on the edge of the bed, sliding her feet into black comfortable flats, one foot at a time. Her dark brown hair is in a ponytail, thin black glasses on her face, small gold stud earrings visible. The floral pajama top and lavender pants are folded on the bed beside her. Andres has gotten up -- his side of the bed is empty, covers pushed back.

### Scene 026: Putting on ID Badge
**Time:** 5:59 AM -- bedroom light on
**Setting:** Bedroom, at vanity
**Description:** Lucia stands at the small vanity and picks up her school ID badge, which hangs on a green lanyard. She loops the lanyard over her head, the badge settling against her light blue blouse at chest level. The badge shows her photo, name "Lucia Moreno," and the school logo. She straightens it with both hands. On the vanity surface: a small mirror, a few makeup items, her glasses case, and a framed photo of her and Andres smiling at a park.

### Scene 027: Checking Reflection
**Time:** 6:00 AM -- morning light growing through window
**Setting:** Bedroom, at vanity mirror
**Description:** Lucia checks her full appearance in the vanity mirror. Light blue blouse, black pants, black flats, green lanyard with ID badge, dark brown hair in ponytail, thin black rectangular glasses, small gold stud earrings, light makeup. She adjusts the collar of her blouse, smoothing it flat. Morning light is beginning to warm the room through the window. The Bucaramanga hills are visible outside, their green slopes touched with early gold. The potted fern on the windowsill glows in the new light.

### Scene 028: Gathering Teaching Materials
**Time:** 6:02 AM -- warm morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at small desk/shelf area
**Description:** Lucia picks up a canvas tote bag from beside the bedroom door and begins packing it. She places a folder of printed worksheets inside, followed by a small pencil case of colored pens, a children's storybook she plans to read to the class, and a small bag of star stickers for the reward chart. The tote bag has a simple design -- cream colored with the words "Buenos dias" printed in green. She checks the folder, flipping through a few pages to confirm the worksheets are all there.

### Scene 029: Packing Lunch Container
**Time:** 6:04 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, near door
**Description:** Lucia adds a small insulated lunch bag to her tote. Inside the lunch bag is a reusable container (she packed rice and chicken the night before, stored in the fridge -- she will grab it on her way out). She also tucks a water bottle into the side pocket of the tote. The tote bag now bulges slightly with the teaching materials, lunch bag, and water bottle. She sets it by the bedroom door, ready to go.

### Scene 030: Entering Kitchen
**Time:** 6:05 AM -- bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, wide view from doorway
**Description:** Lucia walks into the apartment kitchen, which is small but well-organized. White tile counters, wooden cabinets, a gas stove with four burners, a silver refrigerator, a round wooden table with two chairs by the window. A fruit bowl on the counter holds bananas, a mango, and two limes. A small coffee maker sits beside the stove. The kitchen window lets in warm morning light, showing a slice of Bucaramanga's hilly skyline. Andres is already at the counter, measuring coffee grounds into the coffee maker. He wears a gray t-shirt and dark pants.

### Scene 031: Andres Making Coffee
**Time:** 6:06 AM -- bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter near coffee maker

He is a 30-year-old Colombian man with short dark hair, light brown skin, and a trimmed beard. He wears a gray t-shirt and dark pants. The coffee maker begins to gurgle. Two ceramic mugs sit on the counter beside it -- one white and one with a small parrot illustration (Lucia's favorite mug). The smell of brewing coffee begins to fill the kitchen.

### Scene 032: Getting Ingredients from Fridge
**Time:** 6:07 AM -- bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at open refrigerator
**Description:** Lucia stands before the open refrigerator, pulling out items for breakfast. She holds a package of pre-made arepas in one hand and reaches for a container of butter with the other. On the refrigerator shelves: eggs in a cardboard carton, a bottle of milk, fresh cheese wrapped in paper, fruit, leftover containers, and a water pitcher. Photos and a small school calendar are stuck to the fridge door with magnets. Lucia's insulated lunch container (rice and chicken) sits on the top shelf -- she will grab it when she leaves.

### Scene 033: Heating Arepa on Stove
**Time:** 6:09 AM -- kitchen light and morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at gas stove
**Description:** Lucia stands at the gas stove, placing a round white arepa on a flat griddle pan over a medium flame. The gas burner glows blue beneath the pan. She holds a spatula in her right hand, waiting. A second arepa sits on a plate on the counter beside the stove, ready to be cooked next. The arepas are thick, round, and pale -- traditional Colombian corn cakes. A small pat of butter melts on the warming griddle. The coffee maker gurgles in the background.

### Scene 034: Flipping Arepa
**Time:** 6:11 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at stove
**Description:** Lucia slides the spatula under the arepa on the griddle and flips it expertly. The underside is golden brown with slight grill marks. The arepa sizzles as it lands. Steam rises. She adjusts the flame slightly lower with her left hand on the stove knob. Her light blue blouse sleeves are pushed up to her elbows. Her school ID badge swings on its lanyard as she moves. The kitchen smells of warm corn cake and fresh coffee.

### Scene 035: Slicing Fruit
**Time:** 6:13 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Lucia stands at the counter with a small cutting board and a knife, slicing a ripe mango into bright orange wedges. The mango's skin is red and yellow, the flesh vivid orange.

Her thin black glasses reflect the kitchen light as she concentrates on the knife work.

### Scene 036: Plating Breakfast
**Time:** 6:15 AM -- warm morning light through window
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Lucia arranges two plates on the counter. Each plate holds a golden-brown arepa with a pat of butter melting on top, sliced mango wedges arranged in a fan shape, and a few slices of fresh white cheese. She uses the spatula to transfer the second arepa from the griddle to the plate. The plates are white ceramic with a simple green rim. The coffee maker has finished brewing. Two mugs of dark Colombian coffee steam on the counter nearby.

### Scene 037: Carrying Plates to Table
**Time:** 6:16 AM -- warm morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, between counter and table
**Description:** Lucia carries both plates of breakfast to the small round wooden table by the kitchen window. She sets one at her spot and one at Andres's. The table has a small potted succulent in the center and two paper napkins. The window behind the table frames a view of Bucaramanga's green hills in the warm morning light. Andres is pouring coffee into the two mugs -- the white one for himself and the parrot-illustrated one for Lucia.

### Scene 038: Sitting Down to Breakfast
**Time:** 6:17 AM -- warm golden morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia and Andres sit across from each other at the round wooden table. Each has a plate with a golden arepa, butter, mango slices, and white cheese. Each has a mug of coffee -- Lucia's parrot mug steams in front of her. Lucia picks up her arepa with both hands, about to take a bite. Andres holds his coffee mug, blowing on the surface. Morning light streams through the window, casting warm stripes across the table. The small succulent sits between them.

### Scene 039: Eating Arepa
**Time:** 6:19 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at table
**Description:** Lucia takes a bite of her arepa, the golden crust crunching. A small piece of white cheese is stacked on top. She chews with a satisfied expression, her eyes closing slightly. Butter glistens on the arepa's surface. She holds the arepa in both hands, a few crumbs falling to the white plate below. The mango slices on her plate are bright orange, untouched yet. Her parrot mug of coffee is within reach.

### Scene 040: Sipping Coffee
**Time:** 6:21 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia holds her parrot-illustrated mug with both hands and takes a slow sip of hot Colombian coffee. The dark liquid is rich and aromatic. She closes her eyes briefly, savoring the warmth. Steam curls from the mug's rim. Her thin black glasses fog slightly from the steam. Across the table, Andres is eating his arepa and scrolling on his phone. The breakfast plates are half-finished. The Bucaramanga hills outside the window are now golden-green in full morning light.

### Scene 041: Discussing the Day
**Time:** 6:23 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table, two-shot
**Description:** Lucia talks to Andres across the breakfast table, gesturing with one hand while holding a mango slice in the other. She is smiling, describing something about her lesson plan for today. Andres listens, his coffee mug in hand, nodding. His phone lies face-down on the table. Both plates are mostly eaten -- a few mango slices remain. The succulent plant sits between them. The kitchen is warm with morning light and the lingering smell of coffee and arepas.

### Scene 042: Greeting Paco
**Time:** 6:25 AM -- bright living room morning light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Lucia walks from the kitchen into the living room to greet Paco the parrot. Paco is a small green parakeet (periquito) with bright green feathers, a yellow-green chest, and a short curved beak. He sits on a wooden perch inside a medium-sized wire cage that stands on a low table near the living room window. The cage has a small water dish and a seed dish. Paco tilts his head, seeing Lucia approach, and lets out a loud chirp. Lucia smiles and leans toward the cage, one hand on the wire bars. "Buenos dias, Paco!" The living room has a beige sofa, a coffee table, and a small TV on a stand.

### Scene 043: Feeding Paco
**Time:** 6:26 AM -- bright morning light
**Setting:** Living room, close-up at Paco's cage
**Description:** Lucia opens the small door on Paco's cage and reaches inside with a small scoop of birdseed. She pours the seeds into Paco's dish, the tiny seeds making a light rattling sound. Paco hops excitedly on his perch, his green feathers ruffling. He chirps rapidly. Lucia also checks his water dish -- it is low -- and picks it up to refill. She holds the small plastic water dish carefully, a few drops spilling. Paco watches her intently, his small black eyes bright.

### Scene 044: Refilling Paco's Water
**Time:** 6:27 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Living room and kitchen transition
**Description:** Lucia carries Paco's small water dish to the kitchen sink, running the faucet to fill it with fresh water. She holds the dish under the stream, water filling the clear plastic container. She turns off the faucet and walks back to the living room, careful not to spill. Paco is already eating seeds from his dish, his beak cracking them efficiently. Lucia opens the cage door again and clips the water dish back onto the cage bars. Paco pauses eating to dip his beak in the fresh water.

### Scene 045: Talking to Paco
**Time:** 6:28 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Living room, at cage
**Description:** Lucia stands beside Paco's cage, one finger extended through the wire bars. Paco hops over and gently nibbles her fingertip -- a sign of affection. "Portate bien, Paco," Lucia says, telling him to behave. Paco tilts his head and lets out a series of chirps that almost sound like words. His bright green feathers contrast with the wire cage. The morning light streams through the living room window behind the cage, illuminating Paco's plumage in vivid green and yellow. Lucia smiles warmly at the little bird.

### Scene 046: Grabbing Lunch from Fridge
**Time:** 6:29 AM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at refrigerator
**Description:** Lucia opens the refrigerator and retrieves her insulated lunch container from the top shelf. It is a rectangular plastic container with a blue lid, filled with rice, chicken, and a small portion of salad she prepared the night before. She places it in the insulated lunch bag inside her tote. She also grabs a small tangerine from the fridge and tucks it in beside the container. Her tote bag sits on the kitchen counter, already packed with teaching materials and her water bottle.

### Scene 047: Final Check at Door
**Time:** 6:30 AM -- morning light in entryway
**Setting:** Apartment entryway/door area
**Description:** Lucia stands at the apartment's front door, her canvas tote bag slung over one shoulder. She pats her pockets -- phone, keys, check. She adjusts her school ID badge on the green lanyard. Her light blue blouse is neat, black pants pressed, black flats on. Hair in ponytail, thin black glasses, gold stud earrings. She glances back into the apartment. Andres appears from the hallway, dressed for work in a collared shirt and slacks, and leans in to kiss her cheek. "Que te vaya bien," he says. A shoe rack by the door holds several pairs of shoes. Keys hang on a small hook.

### Scene 048: Saying Goodbye to Andres
**Time:** 6:31 AM -- morning light at open door
**Setting:** Apartment front door, open
**Description:** Lucia stands in the open doorway, half-turned to look back at Andres who stands in the entryway. She waves with one hand, her tote bag on her shoulder. Andres waves back with a coffee mug still in his hand, his collared shirt partially tucked in. Behind him, the apartment hallway is visible -- the framed landscape painting on the wall, the shoe rack, and deeper inside, a sliver of the living room where Paco's cage catches the light. Lucia smiles warmly. The apartment building corridor beyond the door has tiled floors and plain walls.

### Scene 050: Stepping Outside
**Time:** 6:33 AM -- bright morning sunlight
**Setting:** Street in front of apartment building
**Description:** Lucia steps through the apartment building's front door onto the sidewalk. Bright morning sunlight hits her face, and she squints slightly behind her glasses. The apartment building is a modest four-story structure with cream-colored walls and iron balcony railings. Potted plants hang from some balconies. The sidewalk is narrow, made of concrete pavers. A few parked cars line the street, including a white Renault Logan (Andres's car). The street slopes slightly uphill -- typical of Bucaramanga's hilly terrain. Trees cast dappled shade ahead. The air is warm and pleasant.

### Scene 051: Walking Up the Hill
**Time:** 6:34 AM -- bright morning sunlight
**Setting:** Residential street, uphill
**Description:** Lucia walks up a sloping sidewalk, her tote bag on her shoulder. The street is lined with modest two- and three-story buildings with colorful facades -- pale yellow, light blue, terracotta. Bucaramanga's hilly terrain means almost every walk involves inclines. Her black flats grip the pavement as she climbs. A motorcycle zips past on the road. A stray dog trots on the opposite sidewalk. Small trees grow from squares cut in the concrete. The morning sun is warm but not yet hot -- Bucaramanga's pleasant spring-like climate.

### Scene 052: Passing the Bakery
**Time:** 6:36 AM -- morning light with warm bakery glow
**Setting:** Street, in front of a panaderia (bakery)
**Description:** Lucia passes a small neighborhood panaderia, its door propped open. The smell of fresh bread drifts out -- pan de bono, almojabanas, and sweet rolls visible on trays behind the glass counter. A hand-painted sign above the door reads "Panaderia La Esperanza." A woman in an apron arranges pastries in the display. Lucia inhales the warm bread smell as she walks past, smiling. Two plastic chairs and a small table sit outside the bakery where an older man drinks coffee from a small cup. Bright morning light catches the glass counter.

### Scene 053: Passing the Corner Store

A cat sits on the counter, watching passersby. The shopkeeper, a middle-aged man in a polo shirt, nods at Lucia. "Buenos dias, profe," he calls her -- short for "profesora," recognizing her as the neighborhood teacher. She waves and continues walking.

### Scene 054: Crossing the Street
**Time:** 6:40 AM -- bright morning light
**Setting:** Intersection with crosswalk
**Description:** Lucia waits at a small intersection, looking both ways before crossing. A few cars pass. A bus rumbles down the cross street, its red and white body visible. She steps onto the painted crosswalk, walking briskly to the other side. Her tote bag bounces lightly against her hip. A traffic light hangs overhead, green for pedestrians. On the far corner, a juice vendor is setting up a cart with oranges and a manual juicer. The Bucaramanga hills rise in the background behind the low buildings.

### Scene 055: Walking Past Parked Cars
**Time:** 6:42 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Residential street, downhill stretch
**Description:** Lucia walks along a stretch of sidewalk lined with parked cars and motorcycles. The street slopes gently downhill now -- the terrain constantly shifts in Bucaramanga. She adjusts her tote bag strap on her shoulder. A woman walks a small white dog in the opposite direction, and they exchange a "Buenos dias." Flowering bougainvillea spills over a garden wall in bright magenta. The sky above is a clear, vivid blue. Lucia's ponytail swings with her steps.

### Scene 056: Approaching the School
**Time:** 6:45 AM -- bright morning light
**Setting:** Street approaching school entrance
**Description:** Lucia sees her school ahead -- a two-story building with pale green walls and a metal gate at the entrance. A sign above the gate displays the school name and the Colombian Ministry of Education shield. Parents and children are arriving on the sidewalk, some holding hands, some in groups. Students wear white uniform shirts and navy pants or skirts. A security guard in a blue vest stands at the open gate, greeting arrivals. Lucia quickens her pace slightly, adjusting her school ID badge. The school yard is visible through the gate -- a concrete patio with a flagpole.

**Time:** 6:47 AM -- morning light, school courtyard
**Setting:** School entrance gate and courtyard
**Description:** Lucia walks through the metal school gate, showing her ID badge to the security guard who nods familiarly. "Buenos dias, profe Lucia." She enters the school courtyard -- a large open concrete patio with a flagpole in the center bearing the Colombian flag (yellow, blue, and red). Potted plants line the courtyard edges. A mural of children reading books covers one wall. Students in white shirts and navy uniforms walk toward their classrooms. Some shout and run. A few parents wave goodbye from the gate. Lucia crosses the courtyard toward her classroom wing.

### Scene 058: Greeting a Colleague
**Time:** 6:48 AM -- school courtyard morning light
**Setting:** School courtyard, near classroom wing entrance
**Description:** Lucia encounters a fellow teacher near the entrance to the classroom building -- Sandra, a woman in her 40s with short curly hair and a bright yellow blouse, carrying a stack of folders. They stop and exchange a warm greeting. Sandra adjusts her folders under one arm and touches Lucia's arm in a friendly gesture. They chat briefly about the morning, smiling. Students pass around them, heading to classrooms. The Colombian flag flutters on the flagpole behind them. The school building's pale green walls frame the scene.

**Description:** Lucia peels a small tangerine, her thumbs digging into the bright orange skin. The peel comes away in a single curving strip. The citrus scent fills the air. She separates the tangerine into segments, the inner fruit glistening. She places a segment in her mouth, closing her eyes briefly at the sweet-tart flavor. The empty lunch container sits beside her, lid back on, fork resting on top. Sandra is peeling a banana across the table. The older teacher has put away her papers and sips from a coffee cup.

### Scene 100: Returning to Classroom
**Time:** 12:15 PM -- school hallway light
**Setting:** School hallway
**Description:** Lucia walks back down the school hallway toward her classroom, lunch bag empty and folded under her arm, water bottle in hand. The hallway is quieter now -- lunch period is winding down. A janitor mops a section of the tile floor, the wet surface reflecting the overhead lights. A few students sit on a bench outside a classroom, whispering. Lucia approaches her classroom door, which she left ajar. Through the open door, she can see students at their desks, some finishing lunches, some talking. She takes a deep breath -- the afternoon session begins.

## PART 8: SCHOOL AFTERNOON (12:30 PM - 2:00 PM)

### Scene 101: Afternoon Class Begins
**Time:** 12:30 PM -- classroom light, afternoon sun through windows
**Setting:** Classroom, Lucia at front
**Description:** Lucia stands at the front of the classroom, the afternoon sun casting warm light through the windows and across the student desks. She claps her hands twice to get attention. "Bueno, ultima clase del dia," she says -- all right, last class of the day. The students settle into their seats. Some look sleepy after lunch. Lucia erases the whiteboard and writes "Repaso y Tarea" -- Review and Homework. The classroom is warm. The ceiling fans in the hallway hum. The sticker reward chart, bulletin board of collages, and Colombian flag fill the walls.

### Scene 102: Reviewing the Day's Lessons
**Time:** 12:35 PM -- afternoon classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, at whiteboard
**Description:** Lucia uses a blue marker to write key review points on the whiteboard: the multiplication table of 3, the vocabulary words from the story (loro, selva, rio), and the parts of a plant. She points to each section with the marker cap, asking students to recall what they learned. A girl raises her hand and recites the parts of a plant from memory. A boy calls out "tres por cuatro, doce!" Lucia smiles broadly, impressed. She draws a small star beside each correct answer on the board.

### Scene 103: Assigning Homework
**Time:** 12:45 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at whiteboard
**Description:** Lucia writes the homework assignment on the whiteboard in large, clear letters so every student can copy it: "Tarea: 1) Practicar tabla del 3 (3x1 hasta 3x10). 2) Dibujar una planta con todas sus partes." She underlines the due date: Wednesday. She turns to the class. "Copien la tarea en sus cuadernos, por favor." Students open notebooks and begin copying. Pencils scratch on paper. Lucia walks between the rows to ensure everyone is writing it down. She pauses at the empty desk in the third row -- that student was absent today.

### Scene 104: Collecting Notebooks
**Time:** 12:55 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, walking between desks
**Description:** Lucia walks through the rows collecting homework notebooks from students who completed yesterday's assignment. Students hold out their small notebooks, some with pride, some with sheepish looks. Lucia takes each one, stacking them on her arm. Some notebooks have colorful covers -- superheroes, flowers, animals. She counts fifteen notebooks -- ten more to collect. She places the stack on her desk beside the grade book. A few students admit they forgot their homework. Lucia notes their names calmly, not scolding but reminding them to bring it tomorrow.

### Scene 105: Packing Up
**Time:** 1:00 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, wide view
**Description:** The end-of-day bell rings. Students spring from their seats, stuffing notebooks and pencil cases into backpacks. The classroom fills with the sounds of zipping bags and excited chatter. Lucia stands at the front, hands on hips. "Recojan todo, empujen las sillas," she reminds them -- pick up everything, push in your chairs. Students push small chairs under desks, some dragging backpacks across the tile floor. The classroom gradually empties as students file toward the door. A few wave at Lucia: "Chao, profe!"

### Scene 106: Saying Goodbye to Students
**Time:** 1:05 PM -- afternoon light at classroom door
**Setting:** Classroom doorway
**Description:** Lucia stands at the classroom doorway, saying goodbye to each student as they leave. She high-fives a boy, ruffles a girl's hair gently, and reminds another to remember his homework. Parents wait outside in the school courtyard, some under umbrellas for shade. A mother approaches and speaks briefly with Lucia about her daughter's progress. Lucia nods and smiles reassuringly. The Colombian flag in the courtyard catches a warm breeze. The last few students trail out, backpacks bouncing on small shoulders.

### Scene 107: Empty Classroom
**Time:** 1:15 PM -- quiet afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, wide view, empty
**Description:** The classroom is empty now, quiet after the day's energy. Twenty-five small desks and chairs sit in neat rows (mostly -- a few are slightly askew). The whiteboard still shows the homework assignment and vocabulary words. The bulletin board displays the morning's plant collages. Scraps of colored paper are visible under a few desks. A forgotten pencil lies on the floor near the third row. The globe on the shelf catches the afternoon sun through the windows. Lucia stands alone at her desk, surveying the room. The potted cactus, grade book, and pen cup remain on her desk.

### Scene 108: Erasing the Whiteboard
**Time:** 1:17 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at whiteboard
**Description:** Lucia picks up the whiteboard eraser and methodically wipes the board clean, sweeping in broad horizontal strokes. The vocabulary words, math problems, and homework assignment fade under the eraser's felt pad. White marker dust drifts off the eraser. She wipes from top to bottom until the board is blank, then sets the eraser back in the tray. The colored markers are lined up neatly -- blue, red, green, black, yellow. She uncaps each one and tests it on the board edge to make sure they still have ink, then caps them again.

### Scene 109: Picking Up Scraps
**Time:** 1:20 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, between desks
**Description:** Lucia walks between the rows of desks, bending to pick up paper scraps from the art project, a forgotten pencil, and a small eraser. She carries a small wastebasket in one hand, dropping items in as she finds them. A crumpled piece of construction paper -- green -- goes into the basket. A stray glue stick cap. She straightens a few chairs that are out of line, pushing them flush against desks. The classroom gradually returns to its tidy morning state. The afternoon light is warm and golden through the windows.

### Scene 110: Packing Her Tote Bag
**Time:** 1:25 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at teacher's desk
**Description:** Lucia sits at her desk and packs her tote bag for the walk home. The stack of homework notebooks goes in -- she will grade them at home tonight. The grade book stays on the desk (it lives there). Her empty lunch container and water bottle go into the insulated lunch bag, then into the tote. She tucks the storybook back in as well. The tote bag is now heavy with notebooks. She zips her pencil case of colored pens and places it inside. The cactus remains on the desk. She pushes in her chair.

### Scene 111: Locking the Classroom
**Time:** 1:30 PM -- hallway light
**Setting:** Classroom doorway, hallway
**Description:** Lucia steps into the hallway, pulling the classroom door closed behind her. She locks it with a small silver key from a keyring she carries. The key turns with a click. The hallway is mostly empty now -- the children have gone home. A janitor sweeps the far end of the corridor. The pale green walls and bulletin boards of the hallway are quiet in the afternoon light. Lucia drops the key ring into her tote bag and adjusts the heavy bag on her shoulder. She heads toward the school exit.

### Scene 112: Leaving School Gate
**Time:** 1:35 PM -- bright afternoon sunlight
**Setting:** School entrance gate
**Description:** Lucia walks through the school gate into the bright afternoon sunlight. The security guard is still at his post, now with a small radio playing cumbia music softly. "Hasta manana, profe," he says. She waves. The street outside the school is calmer now -- the rush of pickup is over. A few parents still chat on the sidewalk. The school's pale green walls and name sign are behind her. The Bucaramanga hills rise in the background, lush and green under the afternoon sun. Lucia turns right, heading home on the same route she walked this morning.

---

## PART 9: WALK HOME AND AFTERNOON (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

### Scene 113: Walking Home Downhill
**Time:** 1:40 PM -- bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Residential street, downhill
**Description:** Lucia walks downhill on the same hilly street she climbed this morning, but in the opposite direction. Her tote bag, heavy with homework notebooks, weighs on her shoulder. She switches it to the other shoulder. The afternoon sun is warm but not harsh -- Bucaramanga's eternal spring climate keeps the temperature pleasant. Bougainvillea flowers in bright magenta and orange hang over garden walls. A few motorcycles pass on the road. She walks at a relaxed pace now, the urgency of the morning gone.

### Scene 114: Buying Fruit from Street Vendor
**Time:** 1:45 PM -- afternoon sunlight
**Setting:** Street corner with fruit vendor
**Description:** Lucia stops at a small fruit stand on a street corner. The vendor, a woman with a sun hat and apron, has arranged her fruits on a wooden cart: papayas, mangoes, bananas, guanabanas, lulos, and bags of fresh-cut pineapple. Lucia points to a bunch of bananas and a ripe papaya. The vendor places them in a plastic bag and hands it over. Lucia pays with a few coins and a small bill from her pocket. "Gracias, senora." She adds the fruit bag to her load, tote on one shoulder, fruit bag in the opposite hand.

### Scene 115: Passing the Bakery Again
**Time:** 1:50 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Street, in front of bakery
**Description:** Lucia passes the same panaderia from the morning. The afternoon shift means different pastries on display -- pan de yuca, buñuelos, and empanadas sit golden-brown in the glass case. The warm smell is irresistible. Lucia pauses, considers, and steps inside. She buys two buñuelos -- round, golden, cheesy fried bread balls -- wrapped in a small paper bag. A snack for herself and Andres. She tucks the paper bag into her tote. The bakery woman smiles. "Profe, siempre a la misma hora" -- teacher, always at the same time.

### Scene 116: Arriving at Apartment Building
**Time:** 1:55 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Street in front of apartment building
**Description:** Lucia arrives at her apartment building, the same cream-colored four-story structure from the morning. She stands at the entrance, fishing her keys from the tote bag. Potted plants on the balconies above are vivid in the afternoon light -- geraniums, ferns, and a flowering vine. Andres's white Renault Logan is not in its parking spot -- he is still at work. Lucia finds her keys, inserts the building key into the lock, and pushes the door open. The cool interior of the building lobby greets her after the warm walk.

### Scene 117: Climbing Stairs Home
**Time:** 1:57 PM -- interior building light
**Setting:** Apartment building staircase
**Description:** Lucia climbs the apartment building's staircase to the third floor, her tote bag heavy on her shoulder, the plastic bag of fruit in her other hand. She takes the stairs slowly, slightly tired from the morning of teaching. Her black flats make soft sounds on the concrete steps. The stairwell is cool and dim compared to the bright street. She passes the second-floor landing, where a welcome mat with a pineapple pattern lies before a neighbor's door. By the time she reaches her own floor, she shifts the tote bag again and reaches for her apartment key.

### Scene 118: Entering the Apartment
**Time:** 2:00 PM -- apartment interior light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway
**Description:** Lucia unlocks the apartment door and pushes it open, stepping inside. The apartment is quiet -- Andres is at work. She sets the heavy tote bag down on the floor beside the shoe rack and kicks off her black flats, letting out a small sigh of relief. She sets the fruit bag on the entryway bench. From the living room, Paco the parrot hears her and begins chirping loudly, recognizing the sound of the door. "Ya llego, Paco!" Lucia calls -- I'm here, Paco! She hangs her keys on the small hook by the door.

### Scene 119: Greeting Paco After School
**Time:** 2:02 PM -- living room afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Lucia walks into the living room and approaches Paco's cage. The green parakeet hops excitedly on his perch, chirping rapidly, his bright green feathers puffing slightly. He bobs his head up and down. Lucia opens the cage door and extends her finger. Paco hops onto it, gripping with his small clawed feet. She lifts him out gently and holds him near her face. "Hola, Paquito, como te portaste?" she asks -- how did you behave? Paco tilts his head and lets out a series of chirps that sound like garbled words. The afternoon light streams through the living room window.

### Scene 120: Paco on Her Shoulder
**Time:** 2:04 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** Paco sits on Lucia's shoulder as she walks through the apartment. The green parakeet perches comfortably, his small clawed feet gripping the fabric of her light blue blouse. He tilts his head, looking around, occasionally nuzzling against her neck. Lucia walks toward the kitchen, one hand raised near Paco to steady him. The living room has a beige sofa, a coffee table with a few magazines, a small TV on a stand, and Paco's cage by the window. The apartment is tidy and bright with afternoon light.

### Scene 121: Changing into Casual Clothes
**Time:** 2:10 PM -- bedroom afternoon light
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Lucia has returned Paco to his cage and gone to the bedroom to change. She has removed her teaching outfit -- the light blue blouse, black pants, and lanyard with ID badge hang on the closet door. She now wears a casual outfit: a soft gray t-shirt and comfortable blue jeans. Her hair is released from the ponytail, falling loose to her shoulders. Her thin black glasses remain on. She slides her feet into simple brown sandals. The floral pajama top from morning has been put away. The bedroom is warm with afternoon sun through the window. The Bucaramanga hills are green and bright outside.

### Scene 122: Reheating Lunch
**Time:** 2:15 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter and microwave
**Description:** Lucia stands at the kitchen counter, opening a container of leftover beans and rice from the refrigerator. She spoons it onto a plate, adds a few pieces of leftover meat, and places the plate in the microwave. She presses the buttons -- the microwave hums and the plate rotates inside. While waiting, she pours herself a glass of cold water from the pitcher in the fridge. The papaya and bananas she bought from the vendor sit on the counter, still in the plastic bag. The kitchen smells of reheating food.

### Scene 123: Eating Afternoon Lunch
**Time:** 2:20 PM -- kitchen afternoon light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia sits at the small round kitchen table, eating her reheated lunch -- rice, beans, and meat on a white plate. She eats slowly, scrolling her phone with one hand, reading a message in the teacher's group chat. The glass of water sits beside her plate. The afternoon light through the kitchen window is warm and golden. The small succulent plant on the table casts a tiny shadow. She takes a bite of rice and beans, then types a quick reply on her phone. The kitchen is quiet except for the distant sound of Paco chirping in the living room.

### Scene 124: Eating a Buñuelo
**Time:** 2:30 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia opens the small paper bag from the bakery and pulls out a buñuelo -- a round, golden-brown fried cheese bread ball, about the size of a golf ball. She takes a bite, the crispy exterior giving way to the soft, cheesy interior. She closes her eyes, savoring the warm, slightly sweet flavor. Small crumbs fall onto the paper bag, which serves as a napkin. The second buñuelo remains in the bag -- that one is for Andres when he gets home. She washes down the bite with a sip of water.

### Scene 125: Washing Dishes
**Time:** 2:35 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Lucia stands at the kitchen sink, washing her lunch plate, fork, and glass under warm running water. She squeezes a drop of dish soap onto a green sponge and scrubs the plate in circular motions. Suds form and slide down the plate. She rinses each item under the faucet and places them in a dish rack beside the sink. The faucet drips once after she turns it off. She wipes the counter with a damp cloth, clearing the crumbs from the buñuelo. The kitchen is clean again. The fruit from the vendor is now in the fruit bowl on the counter.

### Scene 126: Putting Away Fruit
**Time:** 2:38 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Lucia takes the bananas and papaya from the plastic bag and arranges them in the fruit bowl on the counter. The bananas -- a small bunch of five, still slightly green -- join the limes already there. The papaya is large, oval, and green-yellow -- it needs another day to ripen. She folds the empty plastic bag and tucks it into a drawer with other bags, saved for reuse. The fruit bowl is now full and colorful -- bananas, papaya, limes, and a lone mango from this morning's breakfast.

### Scene 127: Resting on Sofa
**Time:** 2:45 PM -- living room afternoon light
**Setting:** Living room, on sofa
**Description:** Lucia sits on the beige sofa in the living room, leaning back against a cushion with her legs tucked beneath her. She holds her phone, scrolling through social media, resting after the morning's teaching. Paco chirps softly from his cage nearby, a content, conversational murmur. The TV is off. A few of Andres's architecture magazines are stacked on the coffee table. The afternoon light comes through the window behind Paco's cage, casting warm stripes across the sofa. Lucia's dark brown hair hangs loose around her shoulders. Her glasses reflect the phone screen.

### Scene 128: Talking to Paco from Sofa
**Time:** 2:50 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room, sofa and cage
**Description:** Lucia looks up from her phone and talks to Paco, who is perched in his cage across the room. "Paco, que dices?" she asks -- what do you say, Paco? The green parakeet tilts his head and lets out a string of chirps that almost form syllables. Lucia laughs. She puts down her phone and walks to the cage, leaning close. Paco hops to the bar nearest to her and presses his beak against the wire. She makes kissing sounds at him. The living room is warm and relaxed. The distant sound of traffic and a neighbor's radio drift in through the window.

---

## PART 10: EVENING -- GRADING AND LESSON PLANNING (4:00 PM - 5:30 PM)

### Scene 129: Setting Up at Kitchen Table
**Time:** 4:00 PM -- late afternoon light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia has transformed the kitchen table into a temporary work desk. The stack of homework notebooks from her tote bag is piled on one side. Her grade book is open. She has a red pen, a blue pen, and a pencil laid out. Her phone plays soft music from a small speaker on the counter. A glass of cold juice (lulo juice, yellowish-green, a Colombian fruit) sits within reach. She sits in the wooden chair, pulls the first homework notebook from the stack, and opens it. The late afternoon light through the window is warm and golden.

### Scene 130: Grading Homework Notebooks
**Time:** 4:10 PM -- late afternoon light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Lucia reads through a student's homework notebook, her red pen in hand. The page shows a child's handwriting practicing multiplication: "3 x 5 = 15" in large, careful numbers. She places a neat checkmark beside the correct answer. The next problem reads "3 x 7 = 22" -- incorrect. She circles it gently with the red pen and writes the correct answer "21" beside it. She adds a small encouraging note at the bottom of the page: "Casi! Sigue practicando" -- Almost! Keep practicing. The notebook has a superhero cover.

### Scene 131: Recording Grades
**Time:** 4:25 PM -- late afternoon light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Lucia has graded five notebooks and now transfers the scores into her grade book. She writes neatly in the gridded columns: "17/20," "20/20," "14/20," "19/20," "16/20." The green hardcover grade book is open flat on the table. Graded notebooks are stacked to her left, ungraded ones to her right. She pauses to sip her lulo juice, the tangy flavor refreshing. The red pen has made marks on her fingers. She wipes them on a napkin. The music on the speaker changes to a soft cumbia song.

### Scene 132: Planning Tomorrow's Lesson
**Time:** 4:40 PM -- late afternoon golden light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Lucia sets aside the homework notebooks and opens a spiral-bound lesson plan notebook. She writes with a blue pen: "Martes -- Matematicas: Tabla del 4. Lectura: Continuacion del cuento. Ciencias: Partes de la planta (repaso). Actividad: Plantar semillas en vasos." She sketches a small diagram of a cup with soil and a seed. Tomorrow they will plant seeds in plastic cups -- a hands-on science activity. She writes a list of materials to bring: "vasos plasticos, tierra, semillas de frijol, agua." She taps the pen on the table, thinking, then adds "Traer etiquetas con nombres."

### Scene 133: Checking Student Work
**Time:** 4:55 PM -- golden late afternoon light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up on notebook
**Description:** Lucia opens another homework notebook -- this one has a cover decorated with flower stickers. Inside, a student has drawn a plant for the homework assignment. The drawing shows a tall green stem, large red flowers, roots going into brown soil, and labels in careful child's handwriting: "raiz," "tallo," "hoja," "flor." Lucia smiles at the effort. She writes at the bottom with her red pen: "Excelente trabajo! Tu planta es muy bonita" -- Excellent work! Your plant is very beautiful. She adds a small drawn star beside the comment.

### Scene 134: Stretching at Table
**Time:** 5:05 PM -- golden light, shadows lengthening
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia pushes back from the kitchen table and stretches, raising her arms above her head and rolling her neck. She has been sitting and grading for over an hour. Her back cracks slightly. The stack of graded notebooks is tall now -- she has finished most of them. The grade book is filled with new scores. She removes her thin black glasses and rubs her eyes, then puts them back on. The lulo juice glass is empty except for a yellowish residue at the bottom. The late afternoon sun is lower, casting long golden rectangles on the kitchen floor.

### Scene 135: Andres Arrives Home
**Time:** 5:15 PM -- early evening light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway
**Description:** The apartment door opens and Andres walks in, carrying a laptop bag over one shoulder. He wears a collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark slacks, and brown shoes. His short dark hair is slightly windblown. "Hola, amor," he calls. Lucia appears from the kitchen, a red pen still in her hand. They embrace briefly in the entryway. Andres sets his laptop bag beside her tote by the shoe rack. He kicks off his shoes. Paco begins chirping loudly from the living room, excited by the new arrival. Andres laughs. "Si, Paco, ya llego" -- yes, Paco, I'm here.

### Scene 136: Andres Greeting Paco
**Time:** 5:17 PM -- living room evening light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Andres walks to Paco's cage and taps lightly on the bars. The green parakeet hops to the nearest perch and lets out a series of excited chirps, bobbing his head. Andres opens the cage door and offers his finger. Paco hops on and Andres lifts him out, holding the bird at eye level. "Como estas, loquito?" he says affectionately -- how are you, little crazy one? Paco nuzzles against Andres's knuckle. Lucia watches from the doorway, smiling, the red pen tucked behind her ear. The living room window shows the early evening sky turning warm orange.

### Scene 137: Giving Andres the Buñuelo
**Time:** 5:20 PM -- kitchen evening light
**Setting:** Kitchen
**Description:** Lucia pulls the paper bag from the counter and hands it to Andres. "Te traje algo de la panaderia," she says -- I brought you something from the bakery. Andres opens the bag and finds the buñuelo inside. He takes a bite immediately, the golden crust crunching. "Rico!" he exclaims -- delicious! He leans against the counter, eating the buñuelo. Lucia's grading materials are still spread across the kitchen table. She begins stacking the notebooks to clear space. Andres chews and nods approvingly, brushing crumbs from his shirt.

### Scene 138: Discussing Dinner Plans
**Time:** 5:25 PM -- kitchen evening light
**Setting:** Kitchen, couple at counter
**Description:** Lucia and Andres stand in the kitchen, discussing what to make for dinner. Lucia leans against the counter, arms crossed. Andres opens the refrigerator and surveys the contents. "Hay pollo, arroz, y tomates," Lucia lists -- there's chicken, rice, and tomatoes. Andres suggests making arroz con pollo -- chicken with rice, a Colombian staple. Lucia nods. They agree. She pulls the chicken from the fridge while Andres fills a pot with water for the rice. The kitchen dynamic is easy and familiar -- they cook together often. The evening light is warm through the window.

---

## PART 11: COOKING DINNER TOGETHER (5:30 PM - 7:00 PM)

### Scene 139: Preparing Ingredients
**Time:** 5:30 PM -- kitchen overhead light on, evening light through window
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Lucia stands at the counter with a cutting board and knife, dicing tomatoes into small red cubes. The tomatoes are ripe, their juice running onto the wooden cutting board. Beside the tomatoes: an onion (half-peeled), two cloves of garlic, and a green bell pepper. The raw chicken pieces sit in a bowl nearby, already seasoned with salt and cumin. Andres is at the sink, rinsing white rice in a metal strainer, water running through the grains. Two pots sit on the unlit stove, waiting. The overhead kitchen light is on now as the daylight fades.

### Scene 140: Chopping Onion
**Time:** 5:35 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at counter
**Description:** Lucia chops a white onion on the cutting board, the knife making rhythmic sounds against the wood. Thin onion slices pile up. Her eyes water slightly and she blinks behind her thin black glasses, turning her head away briefly. She wipes her eye with the back of her wrist, careful not to touch her face with onion-scented fingers. The diced tomatoes are already in a small bowl beside the cutting board. The garlic cloves are peeled and smashed flat with the side of the knife, ready to mince. The bell pepper is washed and waiting.

### Scene 141: Andres Cooking Rice
**Time:** 5:40 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Andres stands at the gas stove, pouring the rinsed rice into a pot of boiling water. The water bubbles around the white grains. He stirs once with a wooden spoon, then adjusts the flame to low. He places a lid on the pot. Steam escapes from the edges. A timer on his phone sits on the counter nearby. He wears a simple apron over his collared shirt -- a navy blue apron that hangs on a hook behind the kitchen door. The gas burner glows blue beneath the pot. The kitchen is warm from the stove and the overhead light.

### Scene 142: Cooking Chicken
**Time:** 5:45 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Lucia stands at the stove, placing seasoned chicken pieces into a hot pan with a thin layer of oil. The chicken sizzles as it hits the pan surface, releasing a savory aroma. She uses tongs to arrange the pieces, each one hissing and popping. The oil splatters lightly. She steps back slightly, holding the tongs. The raw chicken bowl is now empty on the counter. The chopped onion, tomatoes, and garlic wait in bowls nearby, ready to be added. The pan fills the kitchen with the smell of browning, seasoned chicken.

### Scene 143: Adding Vegetables to Chicken
**Time:** 5:50 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at stove close-up
**Description:** Lucia scrapes the diced onion from the cutting board into the pan with the browning chicken using the flat of the knife. The onion sizzles and softens in the chicken juices. She adds the crushed garlic, stirring with a wooden spoon. The kitchen fills with a rich, savory aroma -- garlic, onion, and chicken. Next she adds the diced tomatoes, which release their juice, creating a simmering sauce. She stirs gently, the red tomato sauce coating the golden chicken pieces. The green bell pepper, now diced, waits in a small bowl to be added last.

### Scene 144: Stirring the Pot
**Time:** 5:55 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at stove
**Description:** Lucia stirs the chicken and vegetable mixture with the wooden spoon, the sauce bubbling gently. She adds a pinch of salt from a small bowl and a dash of cumin from a spice jar. She tastes the sauce from the tip of the wooden spoon, tilting her head thoughtfully, then adds a little more salt. The bell pepper pieces go in last, their bright green contrasting with the red sauce. Andres checks on the rice, lifting the pot lid to see the grains absorbing the water. Steam billows up. The kitchen is a warm, busy, fragrant space.

### Scene 145: Setting the Table
**Time:** 6:10 PM -- kitchen overhead light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Andres clears Lucia's remaining grading materials from the kitchen table, stacking the lesson plan notebook and pencil case on the counter. He places two white plates on the table, two forks and knives, two paper napkins, and two glasses. He fills the glasses with cold water from the pitcher in the fridge. The small succulent on the table stays in the center. Lucia is still at the stove, stirring the chicken. The rice pot steams gently on the next burner. The kitchen smells rich with chicken, tomatoes, and garlic. The window now shows the evening sky, the hills dark silhouettes.

### Scene 146: Serving Dinner
**Time:** 6:20 PM -- kitchen overhead light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at stove and table
**Description:** Lucia spoons fluffy white rice onto each plate, then ladles the chicken and vegetable sauce over the rice. The plate is colorful -- white rice, golden chicken, red tomato sauce, green pepper pieces. She brings both plates to the table. Andres is already seated, his glass of water in hand. The dinner looks and smells delicious. Lucia sits across from him, adjusting her glasses. She picks up her fork and takes the first bite. "Quedo rico," Andres says -- it turned out delicious. Lucia smiles, pleased.

### Scene 147: Eating Dinner Together
**Time:** 6:25 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Lucia and Andres eat dinner across from each other at the small round table. The scene is warm and domestic. Lucia forks a piece of chicken and rice together, chewing thoughtfully. Andres talks about his day at the architecture firm -- a new project, a meeting with a client. Lucia listens, nodding, asking a question. Their plates are half-eaten. The water glasses are half-full. The succulent sits between them. Through the window, the evening sky is deep blue. Paco chirps faintly from the living room, a background sound of their home life.

### Scene 148: Discussing Andres's Project
**Time:** 6:35 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at table
**Description:** Andres sketches something on a paper napkin with a pen, explaining a building design to Lucia. He draws a simple rectangle with windows and a roofline, gesturing as he talks. Lucia leans forward, interested, her chin resting on one hand. She points to the sketch and asks a question. Their dinner plates are mostly empty -- a few rice grains and sauce smears remain. The two of them fall into easy conversation, the way couples do at the end of a workday. The pen scratches on the napkin. Andres's enthusiasm for architecture lights up his face.

### Scene 149: Clearing Dinner Dishes
**Time:** 6:45 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Lucia and Andres clear the dinner table together. Lucia carries the plates to the sink while Andres gathers the glasses and forks. The napkin with the building sketch is folded and left on the counter as a keepsake. Lucia turns on the faucet and squeezes dish soap onto the green sponge. She washes the plates while Andres dries with a clean towel, placing them in the cabinet. The kitchen is efficient -- two people working in familiar rhythm. The pots from cooking wait on the stove to cool. Water splashes softly in the sink.

### Scene 150: Washing Pots
**Time:** 6:50 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Lucia scrubs the chicken pan under hot water, the sponge cutting through the cooked-on sauce. Brown residue lifts off the pan surface. She rinses it and hands it to Andres, who dries it with the towel and hangs it on a hook above the stove. Next comes the rice pot -- easier, just a thin starch residue. She scrubs it quickly and rinses. The counter is clean, the dish rack full. Andres wipes down the stove top with a damp cloth. The kitchen returns to its tidy state. Lucia turns off the water and wrings out the sponge.

## PART 12: EVENING RELAXATION (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)

### Scene 151: Moving to Living Room
**Time:** 7:00 PM -- living room evening light, lamp on
**Setting:** Living room, wide view
**Description:** Lucia and Andres walk from the kitchen into the living room. Andres flicks on a floor lamp beside the sofa, casting warm yellow light across the room. Lucia settles onto the beige sofa, tucking her legs beneath her. Andres sits beside her. The TV on the stand is off. Paco is quiet on his perch in the cage, his head tucked slightly -- evening mode. The coffee table holds Andres's architecture magazines and a remote control. The window shows the dark evening sky over Bucaramanga, a few lights from neighboring buildings visible. The apartment feels cozy and warm.

### Scene 152: Turning on TV
**Time:** 7:02 PM -- living room lamp and TV glow
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** Andres picks up the remote control from the coffee table and turns on the TV. The screen flickers to life, showing a Colombian news channel -- a female news anchor in a studio, headlines scrolling at the bottom. The TV glow mixes with the floor lamp light. Lucia leans back on the sofa, her arm resting on the armrest. She removes her glasses and cleans them with the hem of her gray t-shirt, holding them up to the light to check for smudges, then puts them back on. Paco shifts on his perch at the sudden TV sound but settles quickly.

### Scene 153: Watching a Show Together
**Time:** 7:10 PM -- TV and lamp glow
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** Lucia and Andres watch a Colombian comedy show on TV, seated side by side on the beige sofa. The TV casts flickering colored light across their faces. Lucia laughs at something on screen, her head tilting back slightly, her dark brown hair loose against the sofa cushion. Andres chuckles, his arm draped along the back of the sofa behind Lucia. A bowl of popcorn sits on the coffee table between them and the TV. Paco's cage is visible in the corner, the parrot quiet. The floor lamp creates a warm circle of light.

### Scene 154: Snacking on Popcorn
**Time:** 7:20 PM -- TV glow
**Setting:** Living room, close-up at sofa and coffee table
**Description:** Lucia reaches for the bowl of popcorn on the coffee table, grabbing a small handful. She brings the popcorn to her mouth, eating one piece at a time. A few kernels fall to the sofa cushion and she picks them up. The bowl is ceramic, white, filled with fluffy white popcorn with a light salt dusting. Andres takes his own handful. The TV plays in the background. Lucia's thin black glasses reflect the TV screen. The popcorn crunches softly. The scene is domestic and relaxed -- a quiet evening after a full day.

### Scene 155: Lucia Reading on Sofa
**Time:** 7:35 PM -- floor lamp light
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** The TV is now on a lower volume. Lucia has picked up one of her novels from the bedroom -- the one with the bookmark sticking out. She reads, holding the book in one hand, her head propped against the sofa armrest. Her thin black glasses sit on the bridge of her nose. She turns a page, absorbed in the story. Andres watches TV beside her, his feet propped on the coffee table. The floor lamp illuminates the book's pages. Lucia's loose dark brown hair falls across the cushion. She bites her lower lip slightly in concentration.

### Scene 156: Paco Making Evening Sounds
**Time:** 7:45 PM -- living room lamp light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Paco lets out a few soft evening chirps from his cage, a lower, more musical sound than his daytime calls. He shifts on his perch, ruffling his green feathers briefly, then settles with his head tucked slightly under one wing. The cage is dimmer now, away from the direct lamp light. His water dish has been refilled. A few seed hulls litter the cage floor. Lucia looks up from her book and speaks softly to Paco: "Ya casi hora de dormir, Paquito" -- almost time for bed, Paco. The parrot lets out one more soft chirp in response.

### Scene 157: Andres on Laptop
**Time:** 7:55 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** Andres opens his laptop on his knees, the screen showing an architectural floor plan software. He zooms in on a building layout, studying the lines and measurements. The laptop screen casts a blue-white glow on his face. Lucia continues reading her novel beside him. They sit in comfortable silence -- each absorbed in their own activity but sharing the same space. The TV is now off. The floor lamp provides warm ambient light. The coffee table holds the empty popcorn bowl and the remote control. Their evening routine is established and easy.

### Scene 158: Lucia Checking Phone
**Time:** 8:05 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room, at sofa
**Description:** Lucia sets down her novel on the sofa armrest and picks up her phone. She scrolls through the teacher's group chat -- messages about the Friday assembly, a photo of another teacher's classroom decoration. She types a short reply with a thumbs-up emoji. She then checks tomorrow's weather forecast: sunny, 24 degrees -- typical Bucaramanga. She texts her mother a brief "Buenas noches, mami" goodnight message with a heart emoji. Her mother replies with a string of hearts. Lucia smiles at the phone, the screen light reflecting off her glasses.

### Scene 159: Preparing for Tomorrow
**Time:** 8:10 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room, moving to kitchen
**Description:** Lucia stands from the sofa and walks to the kitchen to prepare for tomorrow's science activity. She opens a cabinet and takes out a stack of small plastic cups -- clear, disposable. She counts out twenty-five cups, one for each student. She finds a small bag of dried bean seeds in a drawer, left over from cooking, and sets it on the counter. A bag of potting soil sits under the sink from when she repotted the kitchen succulent. She sets these three items -- cups, seeds, and soil bag -- together on the counter, ready to be packed in the morning.

### Scene 160: Making Tomorrow's Lunch
**Time:** 8:20 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter and stove
**Description:** Lucia stands at the counter preparing tomorrow's lunch to pack. She spoons leftover chicken and rice from the dinner pot into her blue-lidded container, pressing the food flat and sealing the lid. She places the container in the refrigerator on the top shelf where she always keeps it. She also washes a small bunch of lettuce leaves and a tomato, placing them in a small bag for tomorrow's salad addition. The kitchen is quiet, just the hum of the refrigerator. The overhead light illuminates her work. Her gray t-shirt and jeans are comfortable for these evening tasks.

### Scene 161: Setting Up Coffee for Morning
**Time:** 8:25 PM -- kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Lucia prepares the coffee maker for tomorrow morning so Andres can simply switch it on. She opens the lid, places a fresh paper filter in the basket, and measures two scoops of Colombian ground coffee from a foil bag into the filter. The coffee is dark and fragrant even before brewing -- the rich smell of Colombian beans. She fills the water reservoir from the tap and closes the lid. The coffee maker is set, ready for a single button press at dawn. She places the two mugs beside it -- the white one and the parrot mug -- ready for the morning routine.

### Scene 162: Feeding Paco Evening Treat
**Time:** 8:30 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Lucia opens Paco's cage and offers him a small piece of fresh fruit -- a thin slice of banana on her fingertip. Paco takes it delicately in his beak, holding it with one foot on the perch while he nibbles. His bright green feathers are slightly puffed in contentment. Lucia speaks softly to him: "Ultima comidita del dia" -- last little snack of the day. She watches him eat, smiling. The banana slice disappears quickly. She checks his water one more time -- it is fine. She closes the cage door gently. Paco chirps once softly, a thank-you sound.

---

## PART 13: NIGHTTIME ROUTINE (8:30 PM - 10:00 PM)

### Scene 163: Covering Paco's Cage
**Time:** 8:35 PM -- living room lamp light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Lucia picks up a dark blue cloth from beside the cage and drapes it over Paco's wire cage, covering it completely. The cloth blocks out the lamp light, signaling nighttime for the parrot. Paco shifts once on his perch, then settles. A faint chirp comes from under the cloth, muffled. "Buenas noches, Paco," Lucia whispers through the fabric. The covered cage is a familiar nighttime silhouette in the living room. The dark blue cloth hangs evenly on all sides. Lucia smooths one corner. The ritual is the same every night.

### Scene 164: Turning Off Living Room
**Time:** 8:37 PM -- dimming light
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** Andres closes his laptop and stands from the sofa, stretching. Lucia picks up the empty popcorn bowl and carries it to the kitchen. Andres turns off the floor lamp. The living room goes dark except for a faint glow from the kitchen down the hall. The covered cage is a shadowy shape. Andres carries his laptop to the bedroom. Lucia rinses the popcorn bowl at the kitchen sink quickly and sets it in the dish rack. She turns off the kitchen light. The apartment is quiet except for the hum of the refrigerator and the distant sounds of the city.

### Scene 165: Entering Bedroom for Night
**Time:** 8:40 PM -- bedroom overhead light
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Lucia enters the bedroom, where the overhead light is on. Andres is already changing into sleep clothes -- a t-shirt and shorts. His collared shirt hangs on the closet door. Lucia opens the closet on her side and pulls out her sleep clothes: the floral print pajama top and solid lavender pants from this morning, now neatly folded on the shelf. She sets them on the bed. The room is warm and familiar. The digital alarm clock on the nightstand reads 8:40 PM. The window shows darkness, with a few distant lights from the Bucaramanga hillside.

### Scene 166: Changing into Pajamas
**Time:** 8:43 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom
**Description:** Lucia has changed into her pajamas -- the light cotton floral print top and solid lavender pants. She folds her gray t-shirt and jeans, placing the jeans on the closet shelf and the t-shirt in a laundry basket in the closet corner. Her thin black glasses remain on. Her dark brown hair is still loose from the evening. She slides her feet out of the brown sandals and leaves them beside the bed. The bedroom feels softer now, the pajama fabric light and comfortable against her skin. She lets out a relaxed breath.

### Scene 167: Removing Glasses for Bathroom
**Time:** 8:45 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Lucia pauses at the nightstand and decides to keep her glasses on for the bathroom trip. She picks up her phone from the bed where she left it and checks the time -- 8:45 PM. She sets the alarm for 5:30 AM on her phone, the same time every school day. The alarm clock on the nightstand serves as backup. She places the phone on the nightstand beside her novels and the alarm clock. The reading lamp is off. The bedroom is lit only by the overhead light. She heads to the bathroom for her nighttime routine.

### Scene 168: Evening Bathroom -- Washing Hands
**Time:** 8:47 PM -- bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Lucia enters the bathroom and turns on the bright overhead light. She stands at the sink, pumping hand soap from the dispenser and washing her hands under warm running water. The soap lathers between her fingers. She rinses and dries her hands on the white towel. The bathroom looks the same as this morning -- two toothbrushes in the cup, her glasses case (empty, since she is wearing her glasses), the basket of hair ties and clips. The tile floor is cool under her bare feet. The frosted window is dark.

### Scene 169: Removing Makeup
**Time:** 8:49 PM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink facing mirror
**Description:** Lucia opens her makeup bag and pulls out a small packet of makeup remover wipes. She pulls one damp wipe from the packet and gently sweeps it across her face -- forehead, cheeks, nose, chin. The light powder and lip balm come off easily. She examines her face in the mirror, glasses off (set on the counter), checking that her skin is clean. The wipe shows faint beige and pink smudges. She drops it in the wastebasket beside the sink. Her face is bare now, natural, the light olive skin smooth. She puts her glasses back on.

### Scene 170: Brushing Teeth (Evening)
**Time:** 8:52 PM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Lucia squeezes toothpaste onto her purple toothbrush and brushes her teeth for the second time today. The bristles move in small circles. White foam gathers. She watches herself in the mirror, her expression drowsy. Andres appears in the bathroom doorway behind her, his blue toothbrush already in his mouth, foam at the corners of his lips. They brush side by side -- she at the sink, he leaning against the doorframe. A mundane, intimate couple moment. The bathroom light is bright and harsh. Lucia's floral pajama top is reflected in the mirror.

### Scene 171: Rinsing Together
**Time:** 8:54 PM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Lucia spits into the sink and rinses her mouth with water. She steps aside so Andres can rinse at the sink too. They bump elbows slightly in the small bathroom and laugh. Both toothbrushes go back into the cup -- purple and blue side by side. Andres turns off the faucet. Lucia wipes her mouth with the towel and checks her teeth in the mirror. The counter has small water splashes. The makeup bag is zipped closed. The basket of hair ties sits neatly. The nighttime bathroom routine is almost done.

### Scene 172: Applying Night Cream
**Time:** 8:56 PM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at mirror close-up
**Description:** Lucia opens a small jar of night cream from the cabinet beneath the mirror. She scoops a small amount with her fingertip and dabs it on her cheeks, forehead, and nose. She rubs it in with gentle circular motions, the cream making her skin slightly shiny. The jar is simple -- white with a green label. She closes the jar and replaces it in the cabinet. She checks her face one more time in the mirror -- clean, moisturized, glasses on, ready for bed. The bathroom light makes the night cream glisten slightly on her face.

### Scene 173: Leaving Bathroom
**Time:** 8:58 PM -- hallway dim
**Setting:** Bathroom doorway to hallway
**Description:** Lucia flips off the bathroom light and steps into the dim hallway. The apartment is mostly dark now -- only the bedroom light spills from the doorway ahead. She walks the few steps to the bedroom in her bare feet, the tile cool and smooth. The hallway is quiet. Behind her, the bathroom is dark. Ahead, the warm glow of the bedroom beckons. The living room to her left is dark, the covered parrot cage silent. The apartment is winding down for the night. She pushes open the bedroom door fully and enters.

### Scene 174: Pulling Back Bed Covers
**Time:** 9:00 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Lucia pulls back the white and mint green bedding on her side of the bed, folding the blanket down neatly to the foot of the bed. The white sheet underneath is smooth and clean. She fluffs her pillow with both hands, pressing it into shape. The nightstand beside her holds the stack of novels, the reading lamp (off), the alarm clock (9:00 PM), and her phone. On Andres's side, the covers are already pulled back -- he is in the bathroom. The ceiling fan turns slowly overhead. The potted fern on the windowsill is a dark silhouette against the window.

### Scene 175: Reading in Bed
**Time:** 9:05 PM -- reading lamp glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Lucia sits propped up in bed against two pillows, the reading lamp on her nightstand casting a warm circle of light. She holds her novel open, the bookmark set aside on the nightstand. Her thin black glasses sit on her face, the lamp light reflecting in the lenses. Her floral pajama top is cozy. She reads intently, turning a page every minute or so. The overhead light is off -- only the reading lamp illuminates her side of the bed. The rest of the room is in soft shadow. The ceiling fan creates a gentle breeze. The digital alarm clock glows red: 9:05.

### Scene 176: Andres Joining in Bed
**Time:** 9:10 PM -- reading lamp glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Andres walks into the bedroom in his sleep clothes -- a gray t-shirt and dark shorts. He climbs into his side of the bed, pulling the covers up to his waist. He picks up an architecture magazine from his nightstand and flips through it. Lucia glances up from her novel and smiles at him, then returns to reading. They sit side by side in bed, each absorbed in their reading material. The reading lamp provides enough light for both. The room is quiet and comfortable. The alarm clock reads 9:10. The window is dark. The ceiling fan hums.

### Scene 177: Discussing the Novel
**Time:** 9:20 PM -- reading lamp light
**Setting:** Bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Lucia puts her book face-down on her chest and turns to Andres, describing something from the story -- a character's dilemma, a surprising plot twist. She gestures with one hand, her face animated even in the dim light. Andres lowers his magazine, listening with interest. He asks a question. She answers, then picks up the book again and reads aloud a short passage, pointing to the text. Andres nods thoughtfully. The reading lamp casts warm shadows. The book's pages are cream-colored with small type. The moment is intimate and quiet.

### Scene 178: Andres Falling Asleep
**Time:** 9:30 PM -- reading lamp glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Andres has set his architecture magazine face-down on his nightstand and turned onto his side, facing away from the lamp light. His breathing slows. His eyes are closed. The covers are pulled up to his shoulder. Lucia continues reading on her side, the lamp still on. She notices him sleeping and lowers the book briefly, watching him with a soft expression. She pulls the blanket up slightly over his shoulder. Then she returns to her novel, reading quietly, being careful not to rustle the pages too loudly.

### Scene 179: Checking Alarm
**Time:** 9:40 PM -- reading lamp glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** Lucia leans over and checks the digital alarm clock: 9:40 PM. She also picks up her phone and verifies the 5:30 AM alarm is set -- the screen shows the alarm icon active. She sets the phone face-down on the nightstand. Twenty minutes until she wants to sleep. She places the bookmark in her novel, marking the page. The stack of other novels sits beside the alarm clock -- she is making progress through them. The reading lamp highlights the small details: the bookmark's tassel, the alarm clock's red glow, the glasses case (her glasses are still on her face).

### Scene 180: Last Pages
**Time:** 9:45 PM -- reading lamp glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Lucia reads the last few pages of a chapter, her eyes scanning faster as the story reaches a turning point. She turns the final page of the chapter, reads the last paragraph, and exhales softly -- a good stopping point. She slides the bookmark into place and closes the book, holding it against her chest for a moment. The cover is colorful -- a painted landscape. She sets the novel on the nightstand, adding it to the top of the stack. The reading lamp illuminates the book spines. She adjusts her pillow.

### Scene 181: Removing Glasses for Sleep
**Time:** 9:48 PM -- reading lamp glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, close-up
**Description:** Lucia reaches up with both hands and removes her thin black rectangular glasses, folding the temples carefully. She places them on the nightstand beside the novels and the alarm clock. The world blurs slightly for her. She picks up the glasses case and opens it, then nestles the glasses inside and closes it with a soft snap. The case is hard-shelled, black, matching the frames. Without her glasses, her brown eyes look slightly different -- softer, more open. She blinks, adjusting to the blurred reading-lamp lit room.

### Scene 182: Turning Off Reading Lamp
**Time:** 9:50 PM -- reading lamp glow to darkness
**Setting:** Bedroom, at nightstand
**Description:** Lucia reaches over and switches off the reading lamp with a click. The bedroom plunges into darkness, relieved only by the red glow of the digital alarm clock (9:50) and the faint ambient light from the Bucaramanga cityscape through the window. She settles down into the pillow, pulling the white and mint green blanket up to her shoulders. The darkness is comfortable. The ceiling fan hums softly overhead. Andres breathes steadily beside her. The potted fern on the windowsill is a dark shape against the faint light.

### Scene 183: Settling into Sleep Position
**Time:** 9:52 PM -- dark room, alarm clock glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Lucia turns on her side, facing the window, pulling the blanket close. Her dark brown hair fans across the pillow. She tucks one hand under the pillow and lets the other rest on the blanket. Her eyes are closed. The faint light from the Bucaramanga hills -- street lights, apartment windows, the soft glow of the city against the sky -- creates a barely visible outline of the window frame. The alarm clock reads 9:52 in red. The room is quiet except for the ceiling fan and the distant city hum.

### Scene 184: Last Thought of the Day
**Time:** 9:55 PM -- dark room
**Setting:** Bedroom, wide view
**Description:** The bedroom is still and dark. Lucia lies on her side, eyes closed, breathing slowly. Andres sleeps on his back beside her. The white and mint green bedding covers them both smoothly. The nightstands hold their respective belongings -- her novels and glasses case, his magazine. The alarm clock glows 9:55. Through the window, the Bucaramanga hills are a dark silhouette dotted with distant lights. The ceiling fan turns slowly. The potted fern is motionless. The apartment is asleep -- Paco in his covered cage, the kitchen dark, the front door locked. Tomorrow will be another teaching day.

### Scene 185: Sound Asleep
**Time:** 10:00 PM -- dark room, alarm clock glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, wide view from doorway
**Description:** A modern apartment bedroom in Bucaramanga is still and quiet. A 28-year-old Colombian woman with light olive skin and dark brown shoulder-length hair sleeps on the left side of a queen bed with white and mint green bedding. Her thin black rectangular glasses sit folded in their case on the wooden nightstand beside a stack of novels and a reading lamp. A digital alarm clock glows 10:00 in red numbers. Her partner sleeps peacefully beside her. The ceiling fan turns slowly overhead. Through the window, Bucaramanga's hills are dark silhouettes against the night sky. The day is complete.

### Scene 186: Alarm Clock Close-Up
**Time:** 5:30 AM -- dark room with red glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, extreme close-up on nightstand
**Description:** The digital alarm clock fills the view, its red numbers reading 5:30. The plastic casing is black with a matte finish. Two small buttons sit on top -- the alarm and snooze. The red glow illuminates the immediate surroundings: the corner of a novel's colorful cover, the edge of the glasses case, and a few strands of dark brown hair on the pillow nearby. The alarm has just begun to buzz, a sharp electronic tone that cuts through the silence. The rest of the room is dark.

### Scene 187: Morning Light Through Curtains
**Time:** 5:45 AM -- soft gray-gold dawn light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at window
**Description:** The bedroom window frames the early dawn over Bucaramanga. Light gray curtains filter the soft gray-gold light. The silhouette of the hills is visible -- rolling green contours against a brightening sky. A few high-rise buildings in the distance catch the first gold. The potted fern on the windowsill is lit from behind, its delicate fronds glowing green at the edges. Dewdrops are visible on the glass. The ceiling fan turns above, its blades catching the early light. Inside, the room is gradually warming from the new day's glow.

### Scene 188: Making the Bed
**Time:** 5:55 AM -- morning light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at bed
**Description:** Lucia stands on her side of the bed, pulling the white and mint green bedding up and smoothing it flat. She tucks the edge under the pillow, then fluffs the pillow once before placing it neatly. She walks around to Andres's side (he is in the bathroom) and straightens his side too -- pulling up the sheet, smoothing the blanket, aligning the pillows. The bed transforms from a rumpled sleeping place to a neatly made surface. The mint green accents are bright against the white. The reading lamp and novels are tidy on the nightstand. The room looks fresh and ready for the day.

### Scene 189: Opening Bedroom Curtains
**Time:** 5:58 AM -- morning golden light floods in
**Setting:** Bedroom, at window
**Description:** Lucia pulls the light gray curtains apart, sliding them to each side of the window frame. Golden morning light floods into the bedroom, transforming the space. The Bucaramanga hills fill the window -- lush green slopes dotted with houses and apartment buildings, palm trees swaying gently. The sky is a clear, warm blue with a few wispy clouds touched with gold. The potted fern on the windowsill seems to perk up in the fresh light. Lucia stands silhouetted against the bright window for a moment, hands still on the curtain fabric, taking in the view. "Que bonita manana," she whispers -- what a beautiful morning.

---

### Scene 190: Steam from Shower
**Time:** 5:43 AM (alternate morning) -- bathroom light with steam
**Setting:** Bathroom, at shower
**Description:** Steam rises from the shower with the glass door, filling the bathroom with warm mist. The glass door is slightly open, steam curling out into the room. Lucia's floral pajamas are folded on a small shelf by the door. A fresh towel hangs on the rack within arm's reach. The mirror above the sink is fogging at the edges from the steam. Lucia's hand reaches out from behind the glass door to adjust the temperature knob. The bathroom tiles are damp. The overhead light creates a warm glow through the steam.

### Scene 191: Drying Hair with Towel
**Time:** 5:50 AM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Lucia stands at the bathroom mirror, a white towel wrapped around her shoulders, drying her dark brown hair by pressing sections with the towel fabric. Her hair is damp and slightly darker from the water. She wears her teaching outfit already -- the light blue blouse visible beneath the towel. Her glasses are off (on the counter) to avoid getting them wet. She squeezes the hair ends gently with the towel, then drapes the towel over the rack. Her hair will air-dry in Bucaramanga's warm air. She picks up her glasses and puts them on.

### Scene 192: Using Hair Clips
**Time:** 5:52 AM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up at counter
**Description:** Lucia reaches into the basket of hair accessories on the counter and selects two small black metal hair clips. She uses them to pin back the shorter strands near her temples that always escape the ponytail. She clips one on each side, pressing them flat against her hair. The clips are small and practical -- not decorative, just functional for keeping hair out of her face while teaching. The basket holds other accessories: colorful scrunchies, a few bobby pins, and a cloth headband she uses for washing her face. The mirror reflects her focused expression.

### Scene 193: Cleaning Glasses
**Time:** 5:54 AM -- bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on counter
**Description:** Lucia holds her thin black rectangular glasses under the bathroom faucet, running a thin stream of warm water over the lenses. She places a tiny drop of hand soap on her fingertip and gently rubs each lens in small circles, cleaning away overnight smudges and morning fog. She rinses them under the water again, then dries them carefully with a soft microfiber cloth from the glasses case. She holds them up to the light, inspecting each lens. Satisfied, she unfolds the temples and slides them onto her face. The world sharpens into clear focus.

### Scene 194: Watering the Cactus
**Time:** 7:02 AM -- classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, at teacher's desk
**Description:** Lucia picks up a small plastic water bottle from her desk and carefully pours a tiny amount of water into the potted cactus's terra cotta pot. The soil is dry and sandy. She pours slowly, just enough to dampen the top layer -- cacti don't need much water. A few drops roll down the outside of the pot and she wipes them with her finger. The cactus sits in the morning light from the window, its round green body and tiny spines casting a small shadow on the desk. The grade book and pen cup are beside it. She caps the water bottle and sets it aside.

### Scene 195: Opening Classroom Windows
**Time:** 7:05 AM -- morning light and fresh air
**Setting:** Classroom, at windows
**Description:** Lucia walks along the row of windows on the classroom's exterior wall, unlatching and pushing each one open. Fresh morning air flows in, warm and pleasant -- Bucaramanga's eternal spring. The view through the windows shows green hills dotted with trees and the occasional palm, low buildings with colored roofs, and a distant slice of the city. A bird sings outside. The open windows bring life into the room. The alphabet poster flutters slightly in the breeze. Students' papers on desks shift. Lucia props the last window open with a stick and turns back to face the room.

### Scene 196: Morning Assembly in Courtyard
**Time:** 7:15 AM -- bright morning sunlight
**Setting:** School courtyard
**Description:** Lucia stands with her class in the school courtyard during the Monday morning assembly. The students are arranged in a line, smallest to tallest, wearing white shirts and navy uniforms. The Colombian flag (yellow, blue, red vertical stripes) hangs on the flagpole. The principal, a woman in a dark blazer, speaks into a portable microphone about the week's events. Other classes stand in their own lines. Lucia stands at the end of her line, hands clasped behind her back, ID badge on lanyard. The morning sun is bright. The courtyard mural of reading children is visible behind the assembled students.

### Scene 197: Singing the National Anthem
**Time:** 7:18 AM -- courtyard morning light
**Setting:** School courtyard
**Description:** The entire school stands at attention as the Colombian national anthem plays from a small speaker mounted on the courtyard wall. Lucia's students stand straight, some with hands on hearts. Lucia places her right hand over her heart, her lips moving with the words. The Colombian flag ripples slightly on the pole. The courtyard is filled with the anthem's melody. Students of all ages stand in their class lines, teachers at the ends. The Bucaramanga hills form a green backdrop above the school walls. The sun is warm on everyone's faces.

### Scene 198: Walking Students to Classroom
**Time:** 7:22 AM -- school hallway
**Setting:** School hallway
**Description:** Lucia walks at the front of a line of 3rd graders, leading them from the courtyard through the hallway to their classroom. The children walk in pairs, some holding hands, some whispering. Lucia looks back over her shoulder to keep them in line, finger to her lips for quiet in the hallway. The pale green hallway walls display student artwork from various classes. Their classroom door is ahead on the right. The floor tiles reflect the overhead fluorescent lights. A few students from other classes pass in the opposite direction. Lucia's flats make soft sounds on the tile.

### Scene 199: Pencil Sharpener Scene
**Time:** 8:50 AM -- classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, at wall-mounted pencil sharpener
**Description:** A student stands at the wall-mounted pencil sharpener near the classroom door, turning the handle as he sharpens a yellow wooden pencil. Wood shavings curl into the clear plastic reservoir below. The grinding sound fills a brief pause in the lesson. Lucia watches from her desk with a patient expression, waiting for him to finish before continuing. The pencil sharpener is a classic silver hand-crank model bolted to the wall. The student pulls out the pencil and tests the tip with his finger -- sharp. He returns to his seat. Lucia resumes the lesson.

### Scene 200: Using the Globe
**Time:** 10:10 AM -- classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, at shelf with globe
**Description:** Lucia lifts the globe from its shelf and carries it to the front of the class, setting it on her desk. She spins it slowly, the countries and oceans rotating in a blur of color. She stops it with one finger on South America -- on Colombia, specifically. "Aqui estamos nosotros," she says -- here we are. She points to the tiny dot that represents Bucaramanga. The students lean forward to see. She traces the Andes mountains with her finger, showing how they run through Colombia. The globe is a classic model with a beige plastic base and a sphere of blue oceans and colored continents.

### Scene 201: Writing Student Names on Labels
**Time:** 12:40 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at teacher's desk
**Description:** Lucia sits at her desk writing student names on small adhesive labels with a black marker. These will be used tomorrow for the seed-planting activity -- each student's cup will have their name label. She writes carefully in block letters: "SOFIA," "CARLOS," "VALENTINA," "SANTIAGO." The labels are white rectangles on a sheet, and she peels each one off after writing. A stack of completed labels sits beside the grade book. The classroom is quiet -- the students are doing a worksheet. Her pen cup and cactus anchor the desk. The black marker squeaks softly on each label.

### Scene 202: Erasing Student Error Kindly
**Time:** 9:50 AM -- classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, at student's desk
**Description:** Lucia kneels beside a student's desk, holding a small pink eraser. She gently erases an incorrect answer on the student's worksheet, the eraser leaving small pink rubber crumbs on the paper. She blows the crumbs away gently. "Vuelve a intentar," she says with a warm smile -- try again. The student, a boy with large dark eyes, watches her erase, then picks up his pencil to try the problem once more. Lucia points to the relevant section on the whiteboard for reference. Her thin black glasses, ponytail, and patient expression define her teaching style -- encouraging, never punishing mistakes.

### Scene 203: Straightening the Colombian Flag
**Time:** 1:10 PM -- afternoon light
**Setting:** Classroom, at wall
**Description:** Lucia notices that the Colombian flag display on the wall has tilted slightly. She reaches up and straightens the small flag, adjusting the two thumbtacks that hold it. The flag is a printed representation -- yellow at top (the largest stripe), blue in the middle, and red at the bottom. A small framed coat of arms sits beside it. She steps back and checks that it hangs evenly. The class schedule chart hangs nearby, and she glances at it, confirming tomorrow's schedule in her mind. The wall is a gallery of educational posters, the flag, student art, and the sticker reward chart.

### Scene 204: Class Library Corner
**Time:** 11:05 AM -- classroom light
**Setting:** Classroom, library corner
**Description:** The class library corner occupies the back corner of the classroom. A low wooden bookshelf holds about forty books -- picture books, early readers, a few chapter books with colorful spines, and educational magazines. Two floor cushions (one blue, one red) sit on the tile floor before the shelf. A small handwritten sign above the shelf reads "Rincon de Lectura" -- Reading Corner. Three students sit on the cushions and floor, legs crossed, books open on their laps. Lucia organized this corner herself at the beginning of the school year. She glances at it from her desk and smiles.

### Scene 205: Recess Kickball
**Time:** 9:08 AM -- bright outdoor sunlight
**Setting:** School courtyard
**Description:** Lucia watches from the shade as students play a game of kickball in the courtyard. A red rubber ball bounces across the concrete. A girl in a white uniform shirt kicks it hard, sending it sailing across the patio. Children cheer and run to bases marked by backpacks on the ground. The Colombian flag hangs limply in the warm still air. Other students sit along the courtyard wall, eating snacks -- fruit cups and small bags of chips. Lucia sips from her water bottle, keeping a watchful eye on the energetic game. The Bucaramanga hills rise green behind the school walls.

## PART 17: ADDITIONAL EVENING AND HOME SCENES (4:00 PM - 10:00 PM)

### Scene 206: Grocery Shopping with Andres
**Time:** 5:00 PM -- late afternoon light
**Setting:** Small neighborhood supermarket
**Description:** Lucia and Andres walk through a small neighborhood supermarket, pushing a shopping cart with a wobbly front wheel. Lucia holds a handwritten grocery list on a small piece of paper. The store has narrow aisles with packed shelves -- canned goods, bags of rice, cooking oil, cleaning supplies. Fluorescent lights hum overhead. Lucia picks up a bag of dried beans and places it in the cart. Andres reaches for a bottle of cooking oil on a high shelf. They navigate the store together, checking items off the list. A store employee in an apron stacks oranges in the produce section.

### Scene 207: Selecting Vegetables
**Time:** 5:10 PM -- supermarket fluorescent light
**Setting:** Supermarket produce section
**Description:** Lucia stands at the vegetable display, selecting tomatoes. She picks up each tomato, checking for firmness and color -- bright red, no soft spots. She places four good ones in a thin plastic bag. Beside the tomatoes: green peppers, onions, potatoes, yucca, and plantains in their sections. She moves to the onions, selecting two white ones. The produce section smells fresh and earthy. Andres stands behind the cart nearby, reading the label on a jar of salsa. The supermarket is busy with after-work shoppers, the aisles buzzing with movement.

### Scene 208: Paying at Checkout
**Time:** 5:20 PM -- supermarket light
**Setting:** Supermarket checkout counter
**Description:** Lucia places items on the checkout counter conveyor belt: the tomatoes, onions, beans, cooking oil, a bag of rice, two bananas, a carton of eggs, and a bottle of milk. The cashier, a young woman with a ponytail, scans each item with a beeping barcode reader. The total appears on the digital display screen. Andres pulls his wallet from his back pocket and counts out bills. Lucia helps bag the groceries in reusable cloth bags -- one of her environmental habits. The checkout area has candy and gum displays at eye level. A receipt printer whirs.

### Scene 209: Walking Home with Groceries
**Time:** 5:30 PM -- warm late afternoon light
**Setting:** Residential street
**Description:** Lucia and Andres walk home from the supermarket, each carrying a cloth bag of groceries. The late afternoon sun is warm and golden, casting long shadows on the sidewalk. Andres carries the heavier bag (rice, oil, milk) and Lucia carries the lighter one (vegetables, eggs). They walk side by side on the narrow sidewalk, occasionally stepping around a parked motorcycle or a tree root that has cracked the pavement. Bougainvillea flowers glow magenta in the golden light. The apartment building is visible at the end of the street, its cream walls warm in the sunset.

### Scene 210: Putting Away Groceries
**Time:** 5:40 PM -- kitchen overhead light
**Setting:** Kitchen
**Description:** Lucia and Andres unpack groceries in the kitchen. Lucia opens the refrigerator and places the eggs, milk, and tomatoes inside, arranging them neatly. Andres puts the bag of rice and the cooking oil in the cabinet above the counter. The dried beans go into a glass jar on the shelf. Lucia rinses the onions and places them in a wire basket on the counter. The reusable cloth bags are folded and hung on a hook behind the door. The kitchen looks well-stocked now. The fruit bowl on the counter already has bananas and a papaya. Lucia closes the refrigerator and surveys the organized space with satisfaction.

### Scene 211: Preparing Paco's Evening Cage
**Time:** 7:30 PM -- living room light
**Setting:** Living room, at Paco's cage
**Description:** Lucia opens Paco's cage and removes the bottom tray, carrying it to the kitchen. The tray is lined with old newspaper, now scattered with seed hulls, small feathers, and dried droppings. She slides the soiled newspaper into the wastebasket and lines the tray with a fresh sheet of newspaper from a stack she keeps under the sink. The clean tray goes back into the cage. Paco watches from his perch, tilting his head at the disruption to his floor. Lucia refills his seed dish and checks the water. "Listo, Paquito, todo limpio" -- ready, Paco, all clean.

### Scene 212: Calling Her Mother
**Time:** 8:00 PM -- living room lamp light
**Setting:** Living room, on sofa
**Description:** Lucia sits on the sofa, her phone pressed to her ear, talking to her mother on the phone. She speaks in animated Spanish, laughing at something her mother says. Her free hand gestures as she talks. She describes her day -- the students' plant collages, the buñuelos from the bakery, what she cooked for dinner. Her mother's voice is faintly audible from the phone speaker -- warm and affectionate. Lucia tucks her legs under her on the sofa. Andres is in the bedroom, giving her privacy for the call. Paco chirps once from his cage, as if joining the conversation.

### Scene 213: Laying Out Tomorrow's Clothes
**Time:** 8:15 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, at closet
**Description:** Lucia opens the closet and selects tomorrow's teaching outfit: a coral blouse with short sleeves and a modest neckline, navy blue pants, and the same black flats. She lays the blouse and pants over the closet door, smoothing the fabric so they won't wrinkle. The school ID badge on its green lanyard hangs on the closet door handle, ready to be looped over her head in the morning. She checks that the black flats are together on the closet floor. The preparation saves time during the early morning rush. The bedroom lamp casts a warm glow on the organized clothes.

### Scene 214: Checking Tote Bag for Tomorrow
**Time:** 8:20 PM -- bedroom light
**Setting:** Bedroom, near door
**Description:** Lucia sits on the bedroom floor beside her canvas tote bag, going through its contents for tomorrow. She removes today's graded notebooks and stacks them by the door (she will return them to students). She adds the lesson plan notebook with tomorrow's plans, the pencil case of colored pens, and the sheet of student name labels she wrote earlier. She also places the small bag of bean seeds and the stack of plastic cups inside. The potting soil bag is too large for the tote -- she will carry it separately. She checks the tote's side pocket: water bottle is there. She nods, satisfied.

### Scene 215: Final Goodnight
**Time:** 9:58 PM -- dark room, alarm clock glow
**Setting:** Bedroom, wide view
**Description:** The bedroom is dark and still. Lucia and Andres lie in bed under the white and mint green bedding. Lucia is on her side, facing the window, hair fanned across the pillow. Her glasses are in their case on the nightstand. The alarm is set for 5:30 AM. Through the window, Bucaramanga's hills are dark shapes against a deep blue-black sky, scattered with the warm pinpoints of distant apartment lights. The ceiling fan turns slowly. Somewhere in the dark living room, Paco sleeps in his covered cage. The apartment is peaceful. Tomorrow, Lucia will wake and do it all again -- teach, walk, cook, grade, love, and sleep. The day is done.
