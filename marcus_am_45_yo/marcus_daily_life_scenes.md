# A Day in the Life of Marcus: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Marcus, a 45-year-old African American firefighter living in Chicago.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in real-world settings (fire helmet at station, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Repetition of locations (home morning + evening) reinforces learning
- Cultural context embedded naturally
- Profession-specific vocabulary (firefighting equipment, station life)

### Companion Document

**See `CLAUDE.md`** in the project root for the full technical pipeline and project context.

### This Document as a Template

This document follows the established template structure from Matt's daily life scenes. It demonstrates:
- African American male representation
- Middle-aged (45) perspective
- First responder profession
- Family life with spouse and teenagers
- Suburban Chicago setting

---

### Scenario Overview

**This document covers:** Marcus's day off (non-shift day)

This choice provides:
- More home/family vocabulary (similar to Matt's coverage)
- Suburban American daily life
- Father/husband interactions
- Everyday errands and activities
- Some fire station visit for equipment check

**Note:** A separate document could cover Marcus's 24-hour shift day at the station for firefighting-specific vocabulary.
