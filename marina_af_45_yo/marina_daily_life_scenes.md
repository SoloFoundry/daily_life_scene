# A Day in the Life of Marina: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Marina, a 45-year-old Afro-Colombian fisherwoman and community leader living in Tumaco, on Colombia's Pacific coast.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Strong female character in a non-traditional profession
- Rich fishing and maritime vocabulary (net, boat, motor, anchor, oar, bait, catch, cooler, dock, tide, wave, pelican, mangrove)
- Afro-Colombian Pacific coast cultural context (wooden stilted houses, coconut rice, patacones, marimba music, Virgen del Carmen)
- Community leadership vocabulary (meeting, discussion, school, infrastructure, neighbors)
- Objects shown in real-world settings
- Cultural context embedded naturally
- Pacific coast Colombian daily life authentically represented

## PART 1: PRE-DAWN WAKE-UP AND PREPARATION (4:30 AM - 5:30 AM)

---

### Scene 001 — Alarm in the Darkness
**Time:** 4:30 AM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Dark, faint battery lamp glow

Marina's weathered hand reaches out from under a white sheet to silence a small battery-powered alarm clock on the wooden nightstand. The bedroom is dark except for the faint green glow of the clock face. A white mosquito net drapes over the full bed. The wooden plank walls of the stilted house are barely visible. Roberto sleeps beside her, one arm over a thin pillow.

### Scene 002 — Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 4:32 AM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Dark, battery lamp

Marina sits up slowly in bed, pushing the mosquito net aside with one hand. Her black curly hair is loose around her shoulders, sleep-tousled. She wears a light blue cotton nightgown. She reaches for the battery-powered lamp on the nightstand and clicks it on, casting a warm yellow circle of light. The wooden shutters on the window are closed against the night air.

### Scene 009 — Wrapping the Headwrap
**Time:** 4:44 AM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp

Back in the bedroom, Marina stands before the small wooden dresser, pulling her curly hair back with both hands. She picks up a bright orange and yellow headwrap (turbante) from one of the hooks on the wall and begins wrapping it around her head with practiced hands, tucking the ends neatly. The mirror on the dresser is small and spotted with age. Several other colorful headwraps hang on the wall hooks.

### Scene 012 — Kitchen in Darkness
**Time:** 4:51 AM | **Location:** Kitchen | **Lighting:** Battery lamp, pre-dawn dark

Marina enters the small kitchen, setting the battery lamp on the wooden counter. The kitchen has a simple gas stove with two burners, a wooden table with three chairs, open shelves with plates and cups, and a small refrigerator humming in the corner (the power has come back on). A window above the sink shows the sky still black outside. She reaches for a metal pot on the shelf.

### Scene 016 — Drinking Coffee with Bread
**Time:** 4:59 AM | **Location:** Kitchen | **Lighting:** Battery lamp + faint pre-dawn gray

Marina sits at the wooden table, both hands wrapped around the warm coffee mug. A small plate holds two pieces of white bread, one already bitten. She eats quickly — this is fuel, not leisure. The battery lamp makes a pool of light on the table. The kitchen is quiet except for the hum of the refrigerator and the distant sound of waves from the waterfront. A rooster crows somewhere in the neighborhood.

**Objects:** wooden table, coffee mug (both hands), small plate, white bread (one bitten), battery lamp, refrigerator (humming), wooden chair, kitchen

---

### Scene 017 — Packing the Bait Bucket
**Time:** 5:03 AM | **Location:** Kitchen / back area | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn gray

Marina opens the small refrigerator and pulls out a plastic container of bait — small sardines kept cold overnight. She dumps them into a white plastic bait bucket, the silver fish flopping and glistening. The smell is strong and familiar. She snaps the bucket lid on and sets it by the back door beside her rubber boots. Her hands are already slick with fish scales.

**Objects:** small refrigerator (open), plastic container, bait (small sardines), white plastic bait bucket, bucket lid, silver fish, back door, rubber boots, fish scales on hands

### Scene 019 — Grabbing the Wide-Brimmed Hat
**Time:** 5:07 AM | **Location:** Hallway / back door | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn gray-blue

Marina takes the wide-brimmed straw hat from its hook by the back door and places it on her head over the orange headwrap. The hat is weathered and slightly bent, stained with salt. She checks herself briefly — waterproof pants, gray t-shirt, headwrap, hat. She picks up a small cloth bag from the hook beside it that holds her money and phone wrapped in a plastic bag to keep it dry.

**Objects:** wide-brimmed straw hat (weathered, salt-stained), hook, back door, orange headwrap, waterproof pants, gray t-shirt, small cloth bag, money, phone in plastic bag

**Time:** 5:09 AM | **Location:** Back doorstep | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn blue-gray

Marina sits on the wooden back step of the stilted house, pulling on her tall black rubber boots over her thick socks. She stamps each foot to settle it into the boot. The bait bucket sits beside her. Below the stilted house, she can see the muddy ground and the faint gleam of water from the nearby waterfront. The air is warm and humid, smelling of salt and mud. A dog trots by in the pre-dawn light.

**Objects:** wooden back step, stilted house, black rubber boots, thick socks, bait bucket, muddy ground, waterfront gleam, dog, humid air

### Scene 021 — Carrying Gear Down the Steps
**Time:** 5:11 AM | **Location:** Outside stilted house | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn blue

Marina descends the wooden steps of the stilted house carrying the bait bucket in one hand and the cloth bag slung across her body. The house stands on thick wooden stilts about a meter above the ground. Other wooden houses on stilts line the dirt path. The sky is lightening to a blue-gray. A neighbor's light flickers on in a nearby house. The path is damp from overnight humidity.

**Objects:** wooden steps, stilted house (on thick wooden stilts), bait bucket, cloth bag (slung across body), other stilted houses, dirt path, neighbor's light, damp ground, wide-brimmed hat

### Scene 022 — Walking the Path to the Dock
**Time:** 5:14 AM | **Location:** Waterfront path | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn, sky lightening

Marina walks along the dirt path toward the waterfront, rubber boots splashing through shallow puddles. Other figures move in the pre-dawn light — fishermen heading to their boats. She passes a small wooden tienda (shop) with its shutters still closed. Roosters crow from several yards. The smell of the ocean grows stronger. Mangrove roots are visible where the path meets the water's edge.

**Objects:** dirt path, shallow puddles, rubber boots, other fishermen (silhouettes), wooden tienda (shutters closed), roosters, mangrove roots, water's edge, wide-brimmed hat, bait bucket

### Scene 023 — Arriving at the Dock
**Time:** 5:18 AM | **Location:** Wooden dock | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn gray, horizon pink

Marina steps onto the weathered wooden dock, its planks gray and splintered from years of sun and salt water. Several small wooden fishing boats (lanchas) bob gently on the gray-green water, tied to mooring posts with thick rope. Her own boat is third from the end, its blue-painted hull faded. Pelicans perch on the mooring posts, hunched shapes in the dim light. The horizon shows the first thin line of pink.

**Objects:** weathered wooden dock, gray planks (splintered), fishing boats (lanchas), gray-green water, mooring posts, thick rope, Marina's boat (blue faded hull), pelicans, pink horizon line

### Scene 024 — Greeting a Fellow Fisherman
**Time:** 5:20 AM | **Location:** Wooden dock | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn gray-pink

Marina raises a hand in greeting to Don Julio, an older fisherman already untying his boat at the dock. He wears a similar wide-brimmed hat and rubber boots. They exchange a few words about the weather and tides. His boat is green with a small outboard motor. Other fishermen load gear onto their boats nearby. The water laps gently against the dock pilings.

**Objects:** Marina's raised hand, Don Julio (older fisherman), Don Julio's boat (green), wide-brimmed hats, rubber boots, dock pilings, water (lapping), outboard motor, other fishermen, mooring rope

### Scene 025 — Stepping into the Boat
**Time:** 5:22 AM | **Location:** Dock / boat | **Lighting:** Dawn beginning, gray-pink sky

Marina grips a mooring post with one hand and steps carefully from the dock down into her wooden boat, the lancha rocking under her weight. She steadies herself with practiced balance, one rubber boot planted firmly on the boat floor. The boat is about four meters long with wooden bench seats, an outboard motor at the stern, and her fishing gear stowed inside. The bait bucket goes beside the cooler.

**Objects:** mooring post, wooden boat (lancha), dock edge, rubber boots, boat floor, wooden bench seats, outboard motor (stern), fishing gear, bait bucket, plastic cooler

---

### Scene 026 — Checking the Fishing Nets
**Time:** 5:24 AM | **Location:** Boat at dock | **Lighting:** Dawn, sky brightening

Marina crouches in the boat and checks her fishing nets, which are neatly folded on the bow. She runs her hands along the nylon mesh, feeling for tears or weak spots. The nets have small lead weights along the bottom edge and cork floats along the top. She finds a small tear and makes a mental note to repair it later. Rope coils sit beside the nets. The gasoline can is secured near the motor.

**Objects:** fishing nets (nylon mesh, folded), lead weights, cork floats, small tear in net, rope coils, gasoline can, outboard motor, bow of boat, Marina's hands (checking)

### Scene 027 — Untying the Mooring Rope
**Time:** 5:27 AM | **Location:** Boat at dock | **Lighting:** Dawn, pink and gold horizon

Marina stands in the boat and reaches up to untie the thick mooring rope from the wooden post on the dock. Her strong arms pull the knot free with a practiced motion. She coils the wet rope and drops it into the boat. The boat drifts slightly from the dock. Other boats are already motoring out into the gray-green water, their outboard motors buzzing in the still morning air.

**Objects:** thick mooring rope, wooden mooring post, dock, coiled rope (wet), boat (drifting), other boats (motoring out), gray-green water, outboard motors (buzzing), dawn sky (pink and gold)

### Scene 028 — Starting the Motor
**Time:** 5:29 AM | **Location:** Boat leaving dock | **Lighting:** Dawn, golden light on water

Marina moves to the stern and grips the pull cord of the outboard motor. She pulls hard — once, twice — and the motor coughs to life, sputtering then settling into a steady putt-putt rhythm. Gray exhaust smoke drifts over the water. She sits on the stern bench, one hand on the motor's tiller to steer. The boat begins to move away from the dock, cutting a small wake through the calm water. The orange life vest is tucked under the bench.

**Objects:** outboard motor, pull cord, stern, motor exhaust (gray smoke), tiller (steering handle), stern bench, small wake, calm water, dock (receding), orange life vest (under bench)

---

### Scene 029 — Motoring Out Past the Mangroves
**Time:** 5:33 AM | **Location:** Waterway near mangroves | **Lighting:** Dawn, golden light through fog

The boat motors slowly through a narrow waterway lined with mangrove trees. The tangled dark roots of the mangroves reach down into the murky water like fingers. Fog hangs low over the water, turning the morning light into a soft golden haze. A white heron stands motionless among the mangrove roots. Marina steers carefully, watching for shallow spots. The motor putters at low speed.

**Objects:** mangrove trees, tangled roots, narrow waterway, murky water, fog (low), golden haze, white heron, boat, outboard motor (low speed), tiller, Marina's hand (steering)

### Scene 030 — Reaching Open Water
**Time:** 5:38 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Early morning, sun rising

The boat clears the mangrove channel and enters the open Pacific. The water changes from brown-murky to gray-green, with gentle swells rolling under the boat. The horizon stretches wide and endless, the sun a bright orange disc just above the water line. Marina adjusts her wide-brimmed hat against the growing light. The air is fresh with salt. Pelicans glide low over the water ahead of the boat.

**Objects:** Pacific Ocean, gray-green water, gentle swells, horizon, rising sun (orange disc), wide-brimmed hat, salt air, pelicans (gliding), boat, mangrove shoreline (behind)

## PART 2: FISHING AT SEA (5:38 AM - 8:30 AM)

---

### Scene 031 — Reading the Water
**Time:** 5:42 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Early morning sun, golden

Marina stands in the boat, one hand shading her eyes against the sunrise, scanning the water surface for signs of fish — ripples, dark patches, circling birds. Her waterproof pants and gray t-shirt are speckled with salt spray. The boat rocks gently on the swells. The motor idles in neutral. Her experienced eyes read the water the way others read a book.

**Objects:** Pacific Ocean water surface, ripples, sunrise, Marina's hand (shading eyes), waterproof pants, gray t-shirt, salt spray, boat (rocking), swells, idling motor

---

### Scene 032 — Choosing the Spot
**Time:** 5:48 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Morning sun, bright

Marina spots a promising area — a school of fish dimples the surface about fifty meters ahead. She pushes the tiller and the boat turns, the motor revving slightly. Pelicans are diving nearby, a sure sign of fish below. The water here is darker, deeper. She cuts the motor as the boat glides toward the spot, momentum carrying it forward. The fishing nets are ready at the bow.

**Objects:** water surface (dimpled by fish), tiller, boat (turning), motor, pelicans (diving), darker water, fishing nets (at bow), bow of boat, Marina's hand on tiller

---

### Scene 033 — Preparing to Cast the Net
**Time:** 5:52 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning sun

Marina moves to the bow, her rubber boots gripping the wet boat floor. She lifts the folded cast net with both hands, the lead weights clinking together. She gathers the net in careful loops over her left arm, the nylon mesh draping in organized folds. Her right hand holds the throw line. She stands balanced on the rocking boat, legs braced wide, eyes fixed on the water where the fish are moving.

**Objects:** cast net, lead weights, nylon mesh, throw line, loops of net (on left arm), rubber boots, wet boat floor, bow, rocking boat, fish movement in water

---

### Scene 034 — Casting the Net
**Time:** 5:54 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning sun

Marina swings her body and throws the cast net in a wide, circular arc over the water. The net opens into a perfect circle in the air, lead weights pulling the edges down. It hits the water with a soft splash, spreading flat on the surface before sinking. Marina holds the throw line firmly in her right hand, watching the net descend. Sunlight catches the wet nylon strands. The boat drifts slightly with the motion.

**Objects:** cast net (open circle in air), lead weights, water splash, throw line, Marina's right hand, nylon strands (sunlit), boat (drifting), Pacific Ocean surface

---

### Scene 035 — Waiting for the Net to Sink
**Time:** 5:56 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina holds the throw line and waits, counting slowly, letting the net sink deep enough to trap the fish below. The line is taut in her grip, extending from her hand to the water. The boat bobs gently. She watches the surface for signs — bubbles, movement. A frigate bird circles high overhead. The sun is climbing, warming her shoulders through the t-shirt. The wide-brimmed hat shades her face.

**Objects:** throw line (taut), Marina's hand (gripping), water surface, bubbles, boat (bobbing), frigate bird (circling overhead), sun, wide-brimmed hat, t-shirt, shoulders

### Scene 036 — Hauling the Net
**Time:** 5:58 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Morning sun, bright

Marina begins hauling the net back, pulling the throw line hand over hand with her strong arms. The net comes up heavy — a good sign. She pulls steadily, her feet braced against the boat's gunwale for leverage. The wet net piles onto the boat floor. As the bottom of the net breaks the surface, silver fish thrash and flash in the mesh, caught by the lead weight closure. Water streams from the net.

**Objects:** throw line, Marina's arms (pulling), wet net, boat floor, gunwale, silver fish (thrashing), mesh, lead weights, water streaming, boat

---

### Scene 037 — Fish in the Net
**Time:** 6:02 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean / boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina swings the heavy net over the gunwale and into the boat. She opens the gathered bottom and fish tumble onto the boat floor — a mix of corvina (sea bass), pargo (red snapper), and smaller sierra (mackerel). The silver and red fish flop and gasp on the wet wooden planks. Marina quickly counts — maybe fifteen good-sized fish. She smiles broadly, laugh lines deepening. A strong first cast.

**Objects:** net (open), fish (corvina, pargo, sierra), silver and red fish, wet wooden boat floor, gunwale, Marina's smile, fishing catch, boat

---

### Scene 038 — Sorting the Catch
**Time:** 6:05 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina crouches in the boat, sorting fish with quick, practiced hands. She tosses the larger corvina and pargo into the plastic cooler, packing them tightly. The smaller sierra go into a separate pile. Two undersized fish she tosses back over the side — they splash and disappear. Her rubber gloves, thin and blue, protect her hands from the spiny fins. The cooler lid is open, ice from home visible inside.

**Objects:** plastic cooler (open, with ice), corvina, pargo, sierra, rubber gloves (thin, blue), fish spines, boat floor, two small fish (tossed back), water splash, Marina's hands (sorting)

---

### Scene 039 — Baiting the Line
**Time:** 6:10 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina opens the bait bucket and pulls out a small sardine, silver and slippery. She threads it onto a large steel fishing hook attached to a thick hand line. Her fingers work deftly despite the slippery bait. She wipes her hands on her waterproof pants. The hand line is wound around a wooden spool. She will use this for larger fish in deeper water while waiting between net casts.

**Objects:** bait bucket (open), sardine (silver, slippery), steel fishing hook, hand line (thick), wooden spool, Marina's fingers, waterproof pants (wiped), deeper water

---

### Scene 040 — Casting the Hand Line
**Time:** 6:13 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun, sparkling water

Marina swings the baited hook in a circle overhead and releases it, the line singing as it flies out over the water. The lead sinker pulls the bait down quickly. She holds the spool in her left hand, letting the line play out through her right fingers, feeling for the moment the sinker touches bottom. The line goes slack — bottom reached. She wraps the line twice around her palm and settles in to wait, rocking with the boat.

**Objects:** baited hook, hand line, wooden spool, lead sinker, Marina's hands (left on spool, right on line), sparkling water, boat (rocking), overhead sky

### Scene 041 — Waiting with the Line
**Time:** 6:18 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun, bright

Marina sits on the wooden bench in the boat, the hand line looped around her right hand, feeling for the telltale tug of a fish. Her left hand rests on the gunwale. The boat drifts slowly on the current. She watches the pelicans dive — where pelicans feed, fish are plentiful. The sun is warm now, and she adjusts her hat lower over her eyes. The Pacific stretches endless and gray-green around her.

**Objects:** wooden bench, hand line (looped around right hand), gunwale, pelicans (diving), boat (drifting), current, sun, wide-brimmed hat, Pacific Ocean (gray-green), endless horizon

---

### Scene 042 — A Fish on the Line
**Time:** 6:24 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

A sharp tug jolts Marina's hand. She grips the line tight and pulls back to set the hook, feeling the heavy resistance of a large fish. She begins pulling the line in, hand over hand, the muscles in her forearms straining. The line cuts through the water in zigzag movements as the fish fights. The boat tilts slightly with the struggle. Marina braces her feet and pulls steadily, her face focused and determined.

### Scene 043 — Landing the Big Fish
**Time:** 6:28 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina hauls a large pargo rojo (red snapper) over the gunwale. The fish is beautiful — bright pink-red scales, easily three kilograms. It thrashes powerfully in the boat. Marina grabs it firmly behind the gills with one gloved hand and removes the hook with the other. She holds the fish up briefly, admiring it, sunlight gleaming on its wet scales. This one will fetch a good price at the market.

**Objects:** large pargo rojo (red snapper, pink-red scales), gunwale, rubber glove, hook (removed), boat, Marina's hands (holding fish), sunlight on wet scales, three-kilogram fish

### Scene 044 — Into the Cooler
**Time:** 6:30 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina lays the large red snapper into the plastic cooler on the bed of ice. She packs more crushed ice from a plastic bag around it to keep it fresh. The cooler is filling up nicely — several corvina, pargo, and sierra already nested in ice. She closes the cooler lid and latches it. Fresh fish must stay cold for the market. She rinses her gloves in the ocean water over the side of the boat.

**Objects:** plastic cooler, ice (crushed), red snapper, corvina, pargo, sierra, plastic bag (ice), cooler lid (latched), rubber gloves (rinsing), ocean water, boat side

### Scene 045 — Second Net Cast
**Time:** 6:38 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning

Marina has moved the boat to a new spot, motor puttering. She stands at the bow again, gathering the cast net in loops over her arm. The sun is higher now, warming the air. Sweat beads on her forehead under the headwrap. She spots another school of fish — the water dimples and flashes with silver — and throws the net in another wide arc. It opens perfectly and splashes down over the fish.

**Objects:** cast net, loops on arm, bow, motor (puttering), sun (higher), sweat on forehead, orange headwrap, water (dimpled, silver flashes), wide arc, splash

---

### Scene 046 — Hauling the Second Net
**Time:** 6:42 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning sun

Marina hauls the second net cast, her arms pulling the rope in a steady rhythm. This haul is even heavier than the first. She grunts with effort, planting one rubber boot on the gunwale for leverage. The net breaks the surface — a writhing mass of silver sierra mackerel, dozens of them, flashing and flopping. Water pours from the net into the boat. Marina grins — an excellent catch.

**Objects:** net (heavy), rope, Marina's arms (pulling), rubber boot on gunwale, sierra mackerel (dozens, silver, writhing), water pouring, boat, Marina's grin

---

### Scene 047 — Emptying the Net into the Boat
**Time:** 6:45 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning

Marina empties the net onto the boat floor, sierra mackerel spilling out in a silver flood. She works quickly, picking out the larger fish and dropping them into the cooler. Smaller ones go into a separate bucket for personal use — dinner tonight. A few crabs came up in the net too, their claws clicking. She tosses them into the bucket as well. The boat floor is slippery with fish and water.

**Objects:** net (emptied), sierra mackerel (silver flood), boat floor (slippery), cooler, bucket (for dinner fish), crabs (clicking claws), water, Marina's hands (sorting quickly)

### Scene 048 — Drinking Water
**Time:** 6:50 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning sun, hot

Marina pauses to drink from a plastic water bottle she keeps in a cloth bag tied to the bench. The water is warm but refreshing. She tips her hat back and wipes sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. The sun is getting strong now. She pours a little water into her palm and splashes it on the back of her neck. The ocean sparkles white and blue-gray around the boat.

**Objects:** plastic water bottle, cloth bag, wooden bench, sweat, forehead, back of hand, wide-brimmed hat (tipped back), neck (water splashed), sparkling ocean

### Scene 049 — Repairing the Net Tear
**Time:** 6:55 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning

While the hand line is in the water, Marina sits on the bench and repairs the small tear she noticed earlier in the cast net. She threads a thick nylon needle with net twine and weaves it through the torn mesh, creating new loops to close the hole. Her weathered fingers work with precision, the needle darting in and out. The repaired section blends with the old mesh. She bites the twine to cut it.

**Objects:** cast net, small tear, nylon needle, net twine, torn mesh, new loops, Marina's fingers (weaving), wooden bench, hand line (in water), teeth (biting twine)

### Scene 050 — Checking the Hand Line Again
**Time:** 7:00 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning

Marina picks up the hand line spool and gently tugs to check for a fish. Nothing yet. She reels in the line slowly, checking the bait. The sardine is half-eaten — something nibbled without getting hooked. She removes the ragged bait, drops it into the water, and threads a fresh sardine from the bait bucket onto the hook. She casts the line out again, the lead sinker pulling it deep.

**Objects:** hand line spool, bait (half-eaten sardine), hook, fresh sardine, bait bucket, lead sinker, water, ragged bait (dropped), Marina's hands (threading)

### Scene 051 — Third Net Cast from New Position
**Time:** 7:10 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning, sun higher

Marina motors the boat further along the coast, following a flock of pelicans that dive in the distance — a reliable sign of a fish school. She kills the motor and lets the boat drift into position. Standing at the bow, she gathers the repaired cast net and throws it in one smooth motion. The net sails wide and flat, a perfect circle, and lands on the water with a satisfying slap. She watches it sink below the surface.

**Objects:** boat, pelicans (diving in distance), motor (killed), bow, cast net (repaired), wide circle, water surface, slap on water, Marina (standing, throwing)

### Scene 052 — Hauling a Mixed Catch
**Time:** 7:14 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning

Marina pulls the net in steadily, the weight telling her it is a good haul. This time the catch is mixed — several jurel (jack fish) with their yellowish sides, more sierra, and a few small lisa (mullet). The fish tumble into the boat in a wet, shimmering pile. She sorts them quickly into cooler and bucket, her movements efficient after decades of practice.

**Objects:** net (heavy), jurel (jack fish, yellowish sides), sierra, lisa (mullet), wet shimmering pile, boat floor, cooler, bucket, Marina's hands (sorting)

### Scene 053 — A Pelican Lands on the Gunwale
**Time:** 7:20 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning

A large brown pelican lands heavily on the boat's gunwale, its wings folding with a ruffle. It eyes the pile of small fish in the bucket with a beady gaze. Marina laughs and tosses a small baitfish toward the bird. The pelican catches it in its pouch-like bill, tilts its head back, and swallows. It stays perched on the gunwale, hoping for more. Marina shakes her head, still smiling.

**Objects:** brown pelican, gunwale, folded wings, small fish, bucket, baitfish (tossed), pelican's bill (pouch-like), Marina (laughing, smiling), boat

### Scene 054 — Pouring Gasoline into the Motor
**Time:** 7:25 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning

Marina unscrews the cap of the red gasoline can and carefully pours fuel into the outboard motor's tank. The gasoline gurgles as it flows. She watches the level carefully, stopping when the tank is full. She screws the motor's fuel cap back on, then replaces the cap on the gasoline can. A few drops of fuel shine on the surface of the water beside the boat. The smell of gasoline mixes with salt air.

### Scene 055 — Moving to Deeper Water
**Time:** 7:30 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning, sun strong

Marina starts the motor and steers the boat toward deeper water, where the color shifts from gray-green to a darker blue-gray. The coast is now a distant line of green mangroves. Waves are slightly larger here, the boat rising and falling on the swells. Marina adjusts the motor speed and stands, scanning for fish signs. Her rubber boots are wet and splattered with fish scales.

### Scene 056 — Catching a Large Corvina on the Line
**Time:** 7:38 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Bright morning

The hand line jerks hard in Marina's hand — a strong fish. She sets her feet and begins pulling, the line cutting through the water at an angle. Whatever is on the hook is fighting hard, pulling the line to the left. Marina pulls back, gains some line, lets it out when the fish surges, then pulls again. After several minutes, a large corvina breaks the surface — silver-white, at least four kilograms. She swings it into the boat.

**Objects:** hand line (jerking), Marina's hands (pulling), line (cutting water), corvina (silver-white, large), water surface, boat, rubber boots (braced), four-kilogram fish

### Scene 057 — Icing the Big Corvina
**Time:** 7:42 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Bright morning sun

Marina opens the cooler lid and carefully lays the big corvina on top of the other fish, packing more crushed ice from the bag around it. The cooler is nearly full now — a productive morning. She closes the lid firmly and latches it. She counts mentally: at least forty fish of various sizes. Enough for a good market day. She pushes her hat back and wipes her brow, satisfied.

**Objects:** cooler (open, nearly full), large corvina, crushed ice, plastic bag, other fish (packed), cooler lid (latched), Marina's hat (pushed back), brow (wiped), satisfied expression

**Time:** 7:50 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Mid-morning, sun hot

Marina makes one final cast with the net, throwing it far over glinting water. The sun is hot now, beating down on her shoulders. Sweat darkens the back of her gray t-shirt. This last haul brings in a dozen small lisa and a few more sierra. She adds them to the bucket — these will be for cooking at home. She folds the net neatly and stows it at the bow. Fishing is done for today.

**Objects:** cast net (final throw), glinting water, sun (hot), sweat, gray t-shirt (darkened back), lisa, sierra, bucket, net (folded, stowed), bow

### Scene 059 — Heading Back to Shore
**Time:** 8:00 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Mid-morning, bright sun

Marina starts the motor and turns the boat toward shore, the distant line of mangroves growing larger. The boat cuts through the swells, spray flying from the bow. She sits at the stern, hand on the tiller, squinting against the sun's glare on the water. The cooler is full and heavy in the center of the boat. The orange life vest shifts under the bench with the motion. The ride back takes about twenty minutes.

### Scene 061 — Approaching the Dock
**Time:** 8:18 AM | **Location:** Dock area | **Lighting:** Bright morning sun

The dock comes into view — weathered wooden planks, mooring posts, a few boats already tied up from early returns. Marina cuts the motor and lets the boat glide the last few meters, reaching out with one hand to grab a mooring post. The boat bumps gently against the dock. She ties the mooring rope with a quick, practiced knot. A fisherman on the dock waves — Don Julio is already back, his green boat tied up.

After her shower, Marina wraps the clean towel around herself and steps out of the shower stall. She dries off quickly, patting her arms and legs. Her dark brown skin is clean and refreshed. She wrings out her curly hair with the towel. The small mirror on the wall shows her reflection — tired but satisfied from a productive morning. She applies a small amount of cocoa butter from a jar on the shelf to her arms and elbows.

Marina changes into a colorful printed dress — bright blue with yellow flowers — that she wears for afternoons in town. She pulls it over her head and smooths the fabric. She picks a fresh headwrap from the hooks on the wall — this one is bright green with gold patterns. She wraps it skillfully around her damp curly hair. Small gold hoop earrings go into her ears. She slips on brown leather sandals. She looks in the dresser mirror — ready for the afternoon.

She places a paper napkin beside the plate. The table is simple but clean, the wood worn smooth. Through the kitchen window, she can see the waterfront and the glint of boats. She pours cold lemonade from a plastic pitcher into the glass.

The house is quiet except for the fan humming and the distant sound of waves through the open window.

Marina turns on the small battery-powered radio that sits on the kitchen shelf. Cumbia music fills the kitchen — a lively accordion and drums. She taps her sandal on the wooden floor to the beat while finishing the last of her rice. The radio crackles occasionally — reception is spotty in Tumaco. A news bulletin interrupts the music, reporting on weather and tide conditions for the Pacific coast. Marina listens carefully.

She scrubs the plate with a small brush and dish soap, rinses the glass, and sets them both on a drying rack beside the sink. She washes the iron skillet carefully — scrubbing with salt and water, not soap, to preserve the seasoning. The pot that held the coconut rice gets a thorough scrubbing. She leaves them to dry on the rack.

She is going as a community leader now, not a fisherwoman.

Marina steps out the front door and pulls it closed behind her. She secures it with a simple padlock on a metal hasp — the house does not have a fancy lock. She drops the key into the woven tote bag. Standing on the top wooden step, she looks out over the neighborhood — wooden houses on stilts, dirt paths, the waterfront gleaming in the afternoon sun. A warm ocean breeze blows the hem of her dress.

Marina introduces the second topic — clean water access. Several neighborhoods rely on roof-collected rainwater, and the dry season means low tank levels. A young man stands and suggests the community petition for a shared water tank with a filtration system. Marina nods and writes his suggestion on the chalkboard. Another woman asks about costs. The discussion is lively, hands going up, voices overlapping. Marina keeps order firmly but fairly.

Marina stands again to introduce the third topic — her own proposal for a fishing cooperative. She speaks passionately: if the fishermen and fisherwomen of Tumaco band together, they can negotiate better prices for their catch, share costs for ice and gasoline, and support each other during bad seasons. She draws a simple diagram on the chalkboard showing how the cooperative would work. The room listens intently.

Marina leans back against the wooden railing of the steps, listening to the evening sounds. Somewhere in the neighborhood, someone plays a marimba — the deep wooden notes drifting through the warm air. Crickets chirp. A dog barks in the distance. Roberto puts his arm around Marina's shoulder. Yurany stretches her legs down the steps, sandals dangling from her toes. The ocean is a dark line under the first stars.

Marina lifts the red gasoline can and tilts it, judging the weight. About half full — enough for one more trip. She makes a mental note to buy more gasoline at the fuel station tomorrow after the market. She writes a reminder in her spiral notebook at the kitchen table: "Gasolina" with a line under it. She checks the can's cap is tight and stores it in the corner of the back area, away from any heat source.

Marina stands at the concrete bathroom sink, brushing her teeth by the light of the single bare bulb. The mirror reflects her face — tired from the long day but content. She brushes methodically, rinses with water from the faucet, and spits into the sink. She splashes water on her face one last time and pats dry with the towel. The rubber boots sit in the corner, cleaned and ready for tomorrow.

**Objects:** concrete sink, toothbrush, toothpaste, bare bulb, mirror (reflection), tired content face, water, faucet, towel, rubber boots (corner, clean), bathroom

### Scene 152 — Unwrapping the Headwrap
**Time:** 8:25 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp + overhead light

Marina stands before the small dresser mirror and unwraps her green and gold headwrap, carefully folding it. Her black curly hair springs free, compressed from being wrapped all day. She shakes her head slightly, letting the curls loosen. She hangs the headwrap on its hook on the wall among the collection of colorful wraps. She runs her fingers through her hair, working out the flat spots. Roberto is already in bed, reading a folded newspaper.

Marina changes out of her blue dress and into her light cotton nightgown — soft and light purple, reaching her knees. The dress goes on a hanger on the hook. She removes her gold hoop earrings and places them in a small wooden box on the dresser. She slips off her sandals and leaves them beside the bed. The nightgown is cool and comfortable after the long day. She stretches her arms overhead, rolling her shoulders.

### Scene 154 — Evening Prayer
**Time:** 8:32 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp glow

Marina stands before the image of Virgen del Carmen on the wall and crosses herself. She prays quietly — giving thanks for the day's catch, for the community meeting, for her family's health. Her hands are pressed together, her eyes closed. The battery lamp casts a soft golden light on the religious image. The dried palm cross behind the frame casts a small shadow. Roberto waits in bed, respectfully quiet.

Marina picks up the small battery-powered alarm clock from the nightstand and sets it for 4:30 AM — the same time as always. She checks that the alarm is switched on, the small green indicator light glowing. She places it back on the nightstand, within easy reach. Tomorrow will be another fishing day, another market day. The routine is steady and reliable, like the tides.

**Objects:** battery-powered alarm clock, nightstand, 4:30 AM setting, green indicator light, Marina's hand (setting alarm), battery lamp

### Scene 156 — Getting into Bed
**Time:** 8:37 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp

Marina pulls back the white sheet and slides into bed beside Roberto. The bed is firm — a simple mattress on a wooden frame. She pulls the sheet up to her chest. Roberto folds the newspaper and places it on the nightstand. He reaches over and squeezes Marina's hand. The mosquito net hangs above them, a white canopy in the lamp light. Marina adjusts her pillow — a thin, well-worn pillow — and settles in.

**Objects:** white sheet, bed, mattress, wooden bed frame, Roberto, newspaper (folded, on nightstand), hands (squeezed), mosquito net (white canopy), battery lamp, thin pillow

---

### Scene 157 — Pulling Down the Mosquito Net
**Time:** 8:39 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp

Roberto reaches up and releases the mosquito net from its tie-up hooks. The white mesh falls around the bed in a soft curtain, enclosing them in a gauzy tent. Marina tucks the edges of the net under the mattress on her side to seal it. The net filters the lamp light into a diffused glow. A mosquito buzzes outside the net — kept safely out. The ocean breeze stirs the net gently through the open shutters.

**Objects:** mosquito net (falling, white mesh, gauzy tent), tie-up hooks, mattress edges (tucking), Roberto (reaching), lamp light (diffused), mosquito (buzzing outside), ocean breeze, open shutters

### Scene 158 — Turning Off the Lamp
**Time:** 8:41 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp to darkness

Marina reaches through the mosquito net to the nightstand and clicks off the battery-powered lamp. The room goes dark except for the faint moonlight coming through the wooden shutters. Her eyes begin to adjust. She can see the outline of the Virgen del Carmen image on the wall, the bulk of the dresser, the white ghost of the mosquito net. The sound of waves fills the darkness. Roberto's breathing begins to slow.

**Objects:** battery-powered lamp (clicking off), darkness, moonlight, wooden shutters, Virgen del Carmen outline, dresser outline, mosquito net (white, ghostly), waves (sound), Roberto's breathing

### Scene 159 — The Sound of Waves
**Time:** 8:45 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Dark, moonlight

In the darkness, Marina lies on her back, listening. The waves are rhythmic — rush and retreat, rush and retreat — a lullaby she has heard every night of her life in Tumaco. The wooden house creaks softly with the ocean breeze. Through the shutters, she can see a sliver of moon over the water. A distant boat motor hums — a fisherman heading out for night fishing. Marina's eyelids grow heavy.

**Objects:** darkness, waves (rhythmic), wooden house (creaking), ocean breeze, shutters, sliver of moon, moonlight on water, distant boat motor, Marina's heavy eyelids

### Scene 160 — Thinking About Tomorrow
**Time:** 8:48 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Dark, moonlight

Marina's mind drifts through tomorrow's plans: wake at 4:30, fish the morning run, sell at the market, visit the school principal about the roof, buy gasoline. She thinks about the fishing cooperative — there is paperwork to do, members to sign up. Her mind touches briefly on Yurany's biology quiz, on Roberto's gear, on the lentil soup for lunch. The thoughts soften and blur as sleep approaches. The mosquito net sways.

**Objects:** darkness, Marina (thinking), tomorrow's plans, fishing cooperative, Yurany's quiz, mosquito net (swaying), moonlight

---

### Scene 161 — Falling Asleep
**Time:** 8:52 PM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Dark, faint moonlight

Marina turns on her side, facing the window. The moonlight paints a silver stripe across the wooden floor through the shutter gaps. Her curly hair fans across the thin pillow. Her breathing deepens and evens out, matching Roberto's. The battery alarm clock ticks softly on the nightstand. The house is still except for the eternal waves. Marina sleeps, her strong hands resting on the sheet, ready for another day.

**Objects:** moonlight (silver stripe), wooden floor, shutter gaps, curly hair (on pillow), thin pillow, breathing (deep, even), alarm clock (ticking), nightstand, waves, Marina's hands (resting), white sheet

### Scene 162 — Adjusting the Mosquito Net (Pre-dawn)
**Time:** 4:33 AM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Dark, battery lamp

Marina carefully lifts the edge of the mosquito net and tucks it up on its hook so she can get out of bed without letting mosquitoes in for Roberto. The net bunches on her side, leaving Roberto's side still draped. She moves slowly and quietly, her bare feet finding the familiar woven mat. The lamp light is low, just enough to see by. A gecko chirps on the ceiling above.

**Objects:** mosquito net (lifted, hooked on one side), Roberto (still sleeping, draped side), woven mat, bare feet, battery lamp (low light), gecko (chirping, ceiling)

### Scene 163 — Choosing the Headwrap
**Time:** 4:45 AM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Battery lamp

Marina stands before the wall hooks where six colorful headwraps hang in a row — orange and yellow, green and gold, deep purple, red with white patterns, blue with gold thread, and bright pink. She selects the orange and yellow one for today — her fishing headwrap, the one she does not mind getting wet. She holds it up briefly, the fabric vivid even in the low lamp light, then begins the wrapping process.

**Objects:** wall hooks, six colorful headwraps (orange/yellow, green/gold, deep purple, red/white, blue/gold, bright pink), Marina's hands (selecting), orange and yellow headwrap, battery lamp light

---

### Scene 164 — Checking the Weather from the Window
**Time:** 4:50 AM | **Location:** Bedroom | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn dark

Marina pushes open the wooden shutters of the bedroom window and leans out, testing the air. The pre-dawn sky is clear — no rain clouds. The breeze is light, coming from the south — a good fishing wind. She can smell the tide — low and salty, meaning the fish will be near shore. She nods to herself, satisfied, and closes the shutters halfway, leaving them cracked for the breeze. The ocean is a dark murmur below.

**Objects:** wooden shutters (pushed open), bedroom window, pre-dawn sky (clear), breeze (light, south), tide smell (low, salty), ocean (dark murmur), Marina (leaning out, nodding)

### Scene 165 — Passing the Family Photos
**Time:** 4:38 AM | **Location:** Hallway | **Lighting:** Battery lamp carried

Walking down the hallway, Marina passes two framed photographs on the wooden wall. One shows her and Roberto on their wedding day — both young, Marina in a white dress, Roberto in a pressed shirt, laughing on the dock. The other shows baby Yurany in Marina's arms, taken at the town's annual fishing festival. Marina glances at them briefly, as she does every morning, the lamp light sweeping across the faded prints.

### Scene 166 — Rinsing the Coffee Mug
**Time:** 5:01 AM | **Location:** Kitchen | **Lighting:** Pre-dawn gray

Marina rinses her empty coffee mug at the kitchen sink, turning it upside down on the drying rack. She wipes the table where a few bread crumbs fell, brushing them into her palm and tossing them out the window for the birds. The kitchen is tidy enough for now — she will clean properly after lunch. She turns off the gas stove, making sure the knob is fully closed. The blue flame disappears.

**Objects:** empty coffee mug, kitchen sink, drying rack, table, bread crumbs, palm, window (crumbs tossed), gas stove (knob closed), blue flame (disappearing)

### Scene 167 — The Dock at Dawn — Full View
**Time:** 5:19 AM | **Location:** Wooden dock | **Lighting:** Dawn, pink-orange sky

A wide view of the Tumaco fishing dock at dawn. The sky is painted in bands of pink, orange, and pale gold above the dark Pacific water. Dozens of small wooden boats bob on their mooring lines. Fishermen move along the dock in rubber boots and wide hats, loading gear, calling to each other. Pelicans line the mooring posts like sentries. Marina's silhouette is visible on the dock, her wide-brimmed hat and sturdy frame unmistakable against the glowing horizon.

**Objects:** Tumaco fishing dock, dawn sky (pink, orange, pale gold), Pacific water (dark), wooden boats (dozens, bobbing), mooring lines, fishermen, rubber boots, wide hats, pelicans (on posts), Marina's silhouette, glowing horizon

### Scene 168 — Checking the Life Vest
**Time:** 5:23 AM | **Location:** Boat at dock | **Lighting:** Dawn

Before heading out, Marina pulls the orange life vest from under the stern bench and checks the buckles and straps. The vest is faded from sun but the buckles click firmly. She does not wear it while fishing — it restricts her movements with the nets — but it is always in the boat, within reach. She tucks it back under the bench where it stays dry. Safety first, even for an experienced fisherwoman.

**Objects:** orange life vest (faded), stern bench, buckles, straps, clicking buckles, Marina's hands (checking), boat, dock

---

### Scene 169 — Watching a Pelican Dive
**Time:** 6:15 AM | **Location:** Pacific Ocean | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina pauses from fishing to watch a pelican execute a dramatic dive. The large bird folds its wings and plunges straight down from ten meters up, hitting the water with a tremendous splash. It surfaces a moment later, a fish wriggling in its gullet. Marina laughs — "Better than my net!" she says to no one. The pelican shakes water from its feathers and takes off heavily, the fish swallowed. Other pelicans circle, reading the water for their own dives.

**Objects:** pelican (diving, wings folded), ten-meter plunge, tremendous splash, fish in gullet, water surface, Marina (laughing), other pelicans (circling), morning sun, boat

### Scene 170 — Stretching on the Boat
**Time:** 7:05 AM | **Location:** Boat | **Lighting:** Morning sun

Marina stands in the boat and stretches, her arms reaching overhead, her back arching. Hours of hauling nets and pulling lines take a toll. She rolls her shoulders, then bends side to side, loosening her lower back. Her strong arms are sore but she ignores it — the work is not done yet. She takes a deep breath of salt air and adjusts her hat. The Pacific stretches around her, calm and vast.

**Objects:** Marina (stretching, arms overhead), arching back, shoulders (rolling), sore arms, wide-brimmed hat (adjusted), salt air, Pacific Ocean (calm, vast), boat

### Scene 171 — The Mangrove Channel Birds
**Time:** 8:14 AM | **Location:** Mangrove waterway | **Lighting:** Dappled morning light

As the boat moves slowly through the mangrove channel on the way back, Marina passes a nesting area. White egrets perch in the mangrove branches, their bright feathers striking against the dark green leaves. A kingfisher darts across the channel in a flash of blue. Beneath the roots, tiny crabs crawl over the mud. Marina cuts the motor to low, gliding quietly so as not to disturb the birds. The air smells of salt and vegetation.

**Objects:** mangrove channel, white egrets (in branches), dark green leaves, kingfisher (blue flash), tiny crabs, mud, mangrove roots, motor (low), boat (gliding), salt and vegetation smell

Back at the dock, Marina opens the cooler and counts her catch before heading to the market. She tallies on her fingers: twelve corvina, the big pargo rojo, eight sierra, six jurel, four lisa, and the crabs. She nods — a strong haul. She estimates the market value mentally, her lips moving as she calculates. The sun glints off the wet fish scales in the cooler. She closes the lid and lifts the heavy cooler.

**Objects:** dock, cooler (open), fish (counted), fingers (tallying), corvina (twelve), pargo rojo, sierra (eight), jurel (six), lisa (four), crabs, wet fish scales (glinting), cooler lid, heavy cooler

**Time:** 8:33 AM | **Location:** Small tienda near dock | **Lighting:** Bright morning

On the way to the market, Marina stops at a small tienda near the dock to buy a bag of ice. The tienda is a wooden shack with an open front, shelves stacked with bottled water, snacks, and basic supplies. An old chest freezer hums against the back wall. The shopkeeper, a thin man with a mustache, hands Marina a heavy bag of crushed ice. She pours some into the cooler on her head, re-balancing the load, and pays with coins from her cloth bag.

**Objects:** small tienda (wooden shack, open front), shelves, bottled water, snacks, chest freezer (humming), shopkeeper (thin, mustache), bag of crushed ice, cooler (on head), coins, cloth bag

**Time:** 9:15 AM | **Location:** Fish market | **Lighting:** Market lights + daylight

A wide view of the Tumaco fish market at peak morning activity. Rows of concrete tables hold fresh fish of every variety on beds of ice. Vendors call out prices, their voices echoing under the metal roof. Customers — women with shopping bags, restaurant buyers with clipboards, a grandmother with a small child — move between the tables. The air is thick with the smell of fresh ocean and melting ice. Marina stands at her table, serving a customer.

### Scene 175 — Wrapping Fish in Newspaper
**Time:** 10:00 AM | **Location:** Fish market — Marina's table | **Lighting:** Market lights

Marina wraps a customer's purchase in a double layer of newspaper, tucking the ends neatly. Her hands move with speed — fold, tuck, fold, tuck — the fish disappearing into a tidy package. She places it in a thin plastic bag and hands it to the customer with a smile. A stack of old newspapers sits under her table, collected from neighbors for this purpose. The newsprint is already stained with fish oil and water.

**Objects:** newspaper (double layer), fish (wrapped), Marina's hands (folding, tucking), tidy package, thin plastic bag, customer, stack of old newspapers (under table, stained)

### Scene 176 — Dona Carmen's Shrimp Display
**Time:** 10:20 AM | **Location:** Fish market — neighboring table | **Lighting:** Market lights

Marina glances over at Dona Carmen's table. The older woman has arranged her pink shrimp in a beautiful fan pattern on the ice, with the larger langostinos in the center. A handwritten sign reads "Langostinos Frescos" in red ink. Dona Carmen catches Marina looking and winks. The two women share a companionable laugh. Dona Carmen offers Marina a taste of a fresh-cooked shrimp from a small bowl — Marina pops it in her mouth and nods approvingly.

### Scene 177 — Coconut Rice Preparation Detail — Stirring
**Time:** 12:18 PM | **Location:** Kitchen | **Lighting:** Indoor + window light

A close view of the pot on the stove as Marina stirs the coconut rice. The white rice grains are suspended in the creamy coconut milk, beginning to absorb the liquid. Small bubbles pop on the surface. Marina stirs with the wooden spoon in slow circles, scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent sticking. The sweet coconut aroma rises with the steam. She lowers the flame and covers the pot, letting it simmer.

**Objects:** pot (on stove), white rice grains, creamy coconut milk, small bubbles, wooden spoon (slow circles), pot bottom (scraping), coconut aroma, steam, flame (lowered), pot lid (covering)

### Scene 178 — Squeezing Limes for Lemonade
**Time:** 12:22 PM | **Location:** Kitchen | **Lighting:** Indoor + window light

Marina cuts three small green limes in half on the cutting board and squeezes them one by one into the plastic pitcher, her hands twisting firmly. The lime juice streams out, seeds caught in her curled fingers. She adds cold water from the refrigerator, several spoons of sugar, and stirs vigorously. She tastes with a clean spoon — tart and sweet. Ice cubes from the refrigerator's small freezer compartment go into the pitcher with a splash.

### Scene 180 — Applause After the Cooperative Vote
**Time:** 3:22 PM | **Location:** Community center | **Lighting:** Indoor

The room erupts in applause after the cooperative vote. Community members clap, some stand, the older man taps his cane on the floor in approval. Marina's face breaks into a wide grin, her gold earrings swinging as she nods to the crowd. Dona Paola clasps her hands together in excitement. This has been Marina's dream for years — a cooperative to strengthen the fishing families. Don Julio in the front row pumps his fist.

### Scene 182 — Sunset Over the Waterfront
**Time:** 6:10 PM | **Location:** Kitchen window view | **Lighting:** Sunset orange-pink

Through the kitchen window, the sunset paints the sky in layers of orange, pink, and deep purple over the Tumaco waterfront. The dark shapes of fishing boats on the water are silhouetted against the glowing horizon. The mangrove line is a dark fringe along the shore. Marina pauses from setting up dinner to look through the window, one hand resting on the counter. The beauty stops her for a moment, as it does every evening.

### Scene 183 — Roberto's Fishing Stories
**Time:** 6:25 PM | **Location:** Kitchen table (dinner) | **Lighting:** Indoor electric light

Roberto tells a fishing story from his afternoon trip — a large robalo (snook) that fought for ten minutes before breaking the line and escaping. He gestures with his arms to show the size, exaggerating. Yurany rolls her eyes playfully. Marina laughs, reaching over to pat Roberto's arm. The family's dinner plates are half-eaten. The lentil soup steam curls in the light. It is a familiar, comfortable scene.

**Time:** 6:42 PM | **Location:** Kitchen sink | **Lighting:** Indoor electric light

A close view of Yurany at the kitchen sink, water running over a ceramic plate. She scrubs with the small brush, soap bubbles forming. Her braids are pushed over one shoulder to keep them dry.

Yurany hums a song from her phone's playlist — a reggaeton melody — while she works.

### Scene 185 — Marina Oiling the Rubber Boots
**Time:** 7:35 PM | **Location:** Back steps | **Lighting:** Dim light from doorway

Marina sits on the back steps and applies a thin coat of petroleum jelly to her rubber boots to keep them from cracking. She rubs the jelly into the black rubber with a cloth, working it into the seams. The boots are her most important tool besides the nets — without good boots, she cannot fish. She sets them upright by the back door, ready for 5 AM. The night insects sing around her. A gecko catches a moth on the wall.

### Scene 186 — The Moon Over the Water
**Time:** 8:50 PM | **Location:** Bedroom (view from bed) | **Lighting:** Moonlight

Marina lies in bed under the mosquito net, her eyes not yet closed. Through the window's half-open shutters, she can see the moon — nearly full, white and bright — hanging over the Pacific Ocean. The moonlight makes a silver path across the dark water, stretching from the shore to the horizon. She watches it for a long moment. The moon controls the tides, the tides control the fish, the fish control her life. She smiles softly in the dark and closes her eyes.

**Objects:** bed, mosquito net, half-open shutters, moon (nearly full, white, bright), Pacific Ocean, moonlight path (silver, on dark water), shore, horizon, Marina's soft smile, closed eyes
