Beside the bed, a plastic crate turned on its side serves as a nightstand, holding a smartphone with a cracked screen protector, a charger cable, and a small digital alarm clock. Against the opposite wall, a folding table holds DJ equipment: a used DJ controller (black with multicolored pads and knobs), a laptop (silver, sticker-covered lid), over-ear headphones with blue accents, a tangle of audio cables, and a small portable Bluetooth speaker. A plastic chair sits at the table. The motorcycle helmet (red and black) hangs from a wall hook near the door. The black motorcycle jacket with reflective strips hangs on a nail beside it. The orange Rappi insulated delivery backpack leans against the wall near the door. A small wooden closet (ropero) with one door slightly ajar reveals jeans, hoodies, and t-shirts on wire hangers. The walls are bare concrete painted off-white, with one reggaeton concert poster taped up. The floor is bare gray tile. A single window with thin beige curtains looks out onto a narrow street. A pair of black ankle boots sits by the door. A small electric fan sits on the floor near the bed.",

Typical scenes include wide avenues (carreras) with heavy traffic — yellow taxis, red TransMilenio articulated buses on dedicated lanes, cars, other motorcycles weaving between traffic. Concrete and brick buildings line the streets — a mix of small shops (tiendas), bakeries (panaderías), fruit vendors with carts, empanada stands, tinto (coffee) carts with thermoses, pharmacies (droguerías), and cell phone repair shops. Traffic lights, road signs, crosswalks with pedestrians. Street vendors on corners. Santiago's red and black Honda CB 125 motorcycle, slightly scratched, with mirrors and turn signals. The orange Rappi delivery backpack is strapped to his back. He wears his red and black helmet, black motorcycle jacket with reflective strips, black gloves. The Bogotá sky is often overcast with gray clouds, green mountains (cerros) visible in the distance. Street art and murals on some walls. Potholes in the road. The occasional ciclovía (bike lane) with cyclists.",
