# A Day in the Life of Santiago: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Santiago, a 19-year-old Colombian motorcycle delivery rider and aspiring DJ living in Bogotá's Kennedy neighborhood.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Young male character relatable to teen and young adult learners
- Urban working-class vocabulary (motorcycle, traffic, delivery, streets)
- Music and technology vocabulary (DJ equipment, headphones, laptop, speaker)
- Colombian urban context (Bogotá neighborhoods, TransMilenio, tiendas)
- Objects shown in real-world settings
- Cultural context embedded naturally
- Working-class Bogotá daily life authentically represented

## PART 1: MORNING — BEDROOM (8:00 AM - 8:30 AM)

### Scene 001: Morning Alarm
**Time:** 8:00 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, close-up on plastic crate nightstand
**Description:** A smartphone with a cracked screen protector vibrates on a plastic milk crate turned sideways as a nightstand, the alarm screen glowing bright white in the dim room. The small digital alarm clock beside it reads 8:00. A charger cable snakes from the phone across the crate's surface. The thin beige curtains filter pale gray Bogotá morning light. In the background, Santiago lies in the single bed under a dark blue comforter, one arm hanging over the side, face buried in a flat pillow. The small electric fan on the gray tile floor hums quietly.

### Scene 002: Reaching for Phone
**Time:** 8:01 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at bed
**Description:** Santiago reaches one brown-skinned arm out from under the dark blue comforter toward the plastic crate nightstand, fingers fumbling for the vibrating smartphone. He wears a loose gray t-shirt, the sleeve bunched up at his shoulder. His short dark brown hair with a fade cut is mussed from sleep. His eyes are half-closed, face scrunched against the morning. The thin silver chain necklace is visible at his collar. The charger cable tugs slightly as he pulls the phone toward him.

### Scene 003: Checking Notifications
**Time:** 8:03 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed
**Description:** Santiago lies on his back in bed, holding the smartphone above his face with both hands, the screen illuminating his sleepy features. He scrolls through notifications — Rappi delivery app alerts, WhatsApp messages, Instagram. He wears black athletic shorts and a loose gray t-shirt. The dark blue comforter is pushed down to his waist. The flat pillow is dented beneath his head. Morning light through the thin beige curtains creates a soft gray glow across the bare off-white concrete walls.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 8:05 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at bed
**Description:** Santiago sits up on the edge of the single bed, bare feet on the cool gray tile floor. He hunches forward, elbows on knees, rubbing his face with both hands. His short dark hair is flattened on one side from sleeping. The dark blue comforter is bunched behind him. The small electric fan oscillates on the floor nearby. Across the room, the folding table with his DJ controller, sticker-covered laptop, and tangled audio cables is visible. The red and black motorcycle helmet hangs on its wall hook by the door.

### Scene 005: Standing and Stretching
**Time:** 8:07 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, center of room
**Description:** Santiago stands in the center of his small room, arms stretched overhead, fingers interlocked, arching his back in a long morning stretch. He wears black athletic shorts and a loose gray t-shirt, bare feet on the gray tile. His slim athletic build is visible. The silver chain necklace hangs against his chest. Behind him the single bed is unmade, the dark blue comforter twisted. The reggaeton concert poster on the wall is partially visible. The small wooden closet door hangs slightly ajar, revealing dark clothing on wire hangers inside.

### Scene 006: Picking Up Towel
**Time:** 8:08 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at closet
**Description:** Santiago pulls a blue towel from the small wooden closet, draping it over his shoulder. Inside the closet, wire hangers hold dark blue jeans, black hoodies, and several t-shirts. A pair of black canvas sneakers and a pair of black slides sit on the closet floor. He holds his phone in his other hand, checking the Rappi app for early delivery requests. The orange Rappi insulated delivery backpack leans against the wall near the door beside the black ankle boots.

### Scene 007: Grabbing Toiletries Basket
**Time:** 8:09 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, near door
**Description:** Santiago picks up a small plastic basket of toiletries from the floor near the closet — soap bar, shampoo bottle, disposable razor, deodorant stick, and a small bottle of men's cologne rattle inside. The blue towel is over his shoulder. He opens the bedroom door with his free hand, stepping into the narrow hallway of the shared house. The motorcycle jacket with reflective strips hangs on its nail beside the door. The black motorcycle gloves rest on the plastic crate nightstand.

## PART 2: MORNING — BATHROOM (8:10 AM - 8:35 AM)

### Scene 008: Entering Shared Bathroom
**Time:** 8:10 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom doorway, entering
**Description:** Santiago steps into the small shared bathroom, pushing the door open with his shoulder. He carries the plastic toiletries basket in one hand and the blue towel over his shoulder. The fluorescent tube light above the rectangular mirror flickers on, casting harsh white light across the white tile walls with slightly stained grout. The gray tile floor is damp from a housemate's earlier shower. The clear plastic shower curtain is pulled to one side. The white porcelain sink with chrome faucet sits beneath the mirror.

### Scene 009: Setting Down Basket
**Time:** 8:11 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at shelf
**Description:** Santiago places his plastic toiletries basket on the white plastic shelf mounted on the wall, sliding it next to two other baskets belonging to housemates. His basket contains a bar of soap, a shampoo bottle, a disposable razor, a can of shaving cream, a deodorant stick, and a small bottle of men's cologne. He hangs the blue towel on the towel hook on the back of the door. The frosted glass window near the ceiling lets in faint morning light from outside.

### Scene 010: Looking in Mirror
**Time:** 8:12 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago stands at the white porcelain sink, leaning forward slightly, examining his face in the rectangular mirror. The fluorescent tube light casts even white light across his medium brown features. His short dark hair with the fade cut is messy from sleep — pressed flat on one side, standing up on the other. His dark brown eyes are still slightly puffy. He runs a hand over his chin, checking for stubble. The thin silver chain necklace hangs at his collarbone. He wears the loose gray t-shirt and black shorts from sleeping.

### Scene 011: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 8:14 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Santiago brushes his teeth with a blue toothbrush, white foam forming around his mouth. He holds the toothbrush in his right hand, left hand braced on the edge of the sink. The Colgate toothpaste tube lies on the sink ledge beside the toothbrush holder, which holds several toothbrushes of different colors belonging to the house residents. The rectangular mirror reflects his focused expression. Water drips from the chrome faucet into the white porcelain basin.

### Scene 012: Rinsing Mouth
**Time:** 8:16 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Santiago cups water from the running chrome faucet in both hands, bringing it to his mouth to rinse. He spits into the white porcelain sink, then rinses again. Water splashes against the basin. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. The blue toothbrush goes back into the holder. The fluorescent tube light buzzes faintly overhead. A small puddle of water sits on the gray tile floor near the rubber bathmat.

### Scene 013: Turning on Shower
**Time:** 8:17 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at shower stall
**Description:** Santiago reaches into the shower stall and turns the chrome handle, testing the water temperature with an outstretched hand. The water streams down from the showerhead, steam beginning to rise. The clear plastic curtain hangs to one side. He has pulled off his gray t-shirt, which hangs on the towel hook beside the blue towel. His slim athletic build and medium brown skin are visible — he still wears the black shorts. The rubber bathmat sits on the gray tile floor in front of the shower entrance.

### Scene 014: Post-Shower at Mirror
**Time:** 8:25 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago stands at the mirror with a blue towel wrapped around his waist and a smaller towel draped over one shoulder. His short dark hair is wet and darkened, water droplets on his brown skin. The mirror is slightly fogged from the shower steam, and he wipes a clear patch with his hand. The bathroom smells of soap. His plastic toiletries basket is open on the shelf, the bar of soap wet and sitting in its groove. Steam still wisps from the shower stall behind him.

### Scene 015: Applying Deodorant
**Time:** 8:27 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago lifts his right arm and applies deodorant from a white stick, swiping it under his arm. The towel is wrapped around his waist. His reflection shows in the now partially cleared rectangular mirror. The deodorant stick has a blue cap sitting on the shelf beside the shampoo bottle. The disposable razor and can of shaving cream remain unused in the basket today — he shaved yesterday. The fluorescent light casts sharp shadows.

### Scene 016: Quick Cologne Spray
**Time:** 8:28 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago holds the small bottle of men's cologne at arm's length and sprays it once on the side of his neck, then once on his wrist. The glass bottle is dark blue with a silver cap. He rubs his wrists together briefly. The thin silver chain necklace glints against his brown skin. He checks his reflection one more time — satisfied. The toiletries basket is nearly repacked on the shelf.

### Scene 017: Gathering Toiletries
**Time:** 8:30 AM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, near door
**Description:** Santiago gathers his toiletries back into the plastic basket — soap, shampoo, razor, shaving cream, deodorant, and cologne all nestled together. He picks up the blue towel from the hook on the back of the door, draping it over his shoulder. He wears the towel around his waist. He steps toward the door, pulling it open with one hand while balancing the basket. The bathroom light buzzes behind him. A housemate's flip-flops are visible on the floor outside the door.

## PART 3: GETTING DRESSED — BEDROOM (8:32 AM - 8:50 AM)

### Scene 018: Back in Room — Choosing Clothes
**Time:** 8:32 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at closet
**Description:** Santiago stands at the open wooden closet in his towel, scanning the wire hangers. His delivery work clothes are easy to find — the dark blue jeans and a black hoodie. A few graphic tees hang beside them. He pulls the jeans off a hanger, tossing them onto the unmade bed. The DJ controller on the folding table catches the gray morning light from the window. The smartphone on the crate nightstand buzzes with another Rappi notification.

### Scene 019: Getting Dressed — Jeans and Hoodie
**Time:** 8:35 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, center of room
**Description:** Santiago pulls the black hoodie over his head, tugging it down over his chest. He already wears the dark blue jeans and a pair of dark socks. His short dark hair pokes through the hoodie's neck hole slightly mussed. The thin silver chain necklace is tucked inside the hoodie collar. The blue towel lies in a heap on the bed. On the floor near the door, the black ankle boots wait to be laced up. The orange Rappi delivery backpack leans against the wall.

### Scene 020: Lacing Boots
**Time:** 8:37 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, sitting on bed
**Description:** Santiago sits on the edge of the single bed, leaning forward to lace up his black ankle boots. His fingers pull the laces tight and tie them in quick double knots. The dark blue jeans are cuffed slightly above the boot tops. Beside him on the bed, the smartphone displays the Rappi delivery app map showing his zone in Kennedy. The dark blue comforter is pushed to one side. The small electric fan hums from the floor.

### Scene 021: Putting On Motorcycle Jacket
**Time:** 8:39 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, near door
**Description:** Santiago takes the black motorcycle jacket with reflective strips off the nail by the door and swings it on over the black hoodie. He zips it halfway up, the reflective strips catching the light. The jacket is slightly worn at the elbows but in good condition. The black motorcycle gloves poke out from one pocket. He adjusts the collar, the silver chain necklace now hidden beneath layers. The bedroom is tidy enough — bed unmade but clothes put away.

### Scene 022: Grabbing Helmet and Backpack
**Time:** 8:40 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at door
**Description:** Santiago lifts the red and black full-face motorcycle helmet off the wall hook by the door, tucking it under his left arm. With his right hand he grabs the orange Rappi insulated delivery backpack by its top handle, swinging it onto one shoulder. The backpack is large and boxy, bright orange with the Rappi logo. He pats his jeans pocket checking for his wallet and keys. The smartphone is in his hoodie pocket. He takes one last glance at the room — DJ controller, laptop, headphones all waiting for tonight.

### Scene 023: Walking Through Hallway
**Time:** 8:42 AM
**Setting:** Shared house hallway
**Description:** Santiago walks through the narrow hallway of the shared house, motorcycle helmet under one arm and Rappi backpack on his shoulder. The hallway has bare white walls and gray tile flooring. A single overhead bulb lights the corridor. Two other closed bedroom doors line the hall. A small shelf near the entrance holds a communal shoe tray with various sneakers and sandals. The front door at the end of the hallway is a heavy metal security door with two deadbolts, painted dark green.

### Scene 024: Quick Breakfast — Bread and Coffee
**Time:** 8:44 AM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen
**Description:** Santiago stands at a small counter in the shared house kitchen, pouring hot coffee from a thermos into a white ceramic mug. On a small plate beside him sits a bread roll (pan) split open and spread with butter. The kitchen is compact — a two-burner gas stove, a small refrigerator with magnets and notes, a chrome sink with stacked dishes, and open shelves with assorted plates and cups. He takes a sip of the strong black coffee — tinto — and bites into the bread roll, chewing quickly. The motorcycle helmet sits on the counter. The Rappi backpack rests against the wall.

### Scene 025: Checking Rappi App Over Breakfast
**Time:** 8:46 AM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen
**Description:** Santiago holds the smartphone in one hand and the bread roll in the other, scrolling through the Rappi delivery app while eating. The screen shows a map of Bogotá with delivery zones highlighted. A new order notification pops up. He takes a quick sip of the tinto from the white mug on the counter. Crumbs dot the small plate. The overhead kitchen light is a bare bulb in a simple fixture. A window above the sink shows the overcast Bogotá sky outside, gray clouds hanging low.

### Scene 026: Rinsing Mug
**Time:** 8:48 AM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen
**Description:** Santiago rinses the white ceramic mug under the chrome faucet at the kitchen sink, shaking off the water and setting it on the dish rack beside other drying cups. He wipes his hands on a cloth towel hanging from a hook on the cabinet door. The small plate goes into the sink. He checks the time on his phone — 8:48. Time to go. The motorcycle helmet waits on the counter. He slings the orange Rappi backpack onto his back with both straps.

## PART 4: HEADING OUT — STREET (8:50 AM - 9:10 AM)

### Scene 027: Exiting the House
**Time:** 8:50 AM
**Setting:** Front of shared house, Kennedy neighborhood street
**Description:** Santiago steps through the heavy dark green metal security door onto the narrow sidewalk of a Kennedy neighborhood street. He wears the full delivery outfit — black motorcycle jacket with reflective strips over the black hoodie, dark blue jeans, black ankle boots, orange Rappi backpack on his back. The helmet is in his hand. The shared house is a two-story brick building with a small barred window and the green metal door. Neighboring houses are similar — close together, painted different faded colors, metal security bars on windows. The narrow street has cracked pavement. A tienda across the street has its metal shutters half-raised, crates of fruit visible inside.

### Scene 028: Walking to Motorcycle
**Time:** 8:51 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood street, at parked motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago walks a few meters down the sidewalk to where his red and black Honda CB 125 motorcycle is parked against the curb, chained to a metal post with a heavy chain lock. The motorcycle is slightly scratched from daily use, the chrome mirrors reflecting the overcast sky. He fishes a small key ring from his jeans pocket — a motorcycle key and a house key on a simple metal ring. A neighbor walking past raises a hand in greeting. The sidewalk is narrow and cracked, a concrete light pole nearby.

### Scene 029: Unlocking Motorcycle Chain
**Time:** 8:52 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood street, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago crouches beside the red and black Honda CB 125, inserting the key into the heavy chain lock that secures the motorcycle to the metal post. The chain is thick, silver-colored, and heavy. He twists the key and the lock opens with a click. He loops the chain and lock together and stores them in the small compartment under the motorcycle seat, lifting the seat with one hand. The Rappi backpack shifts on his back. His black ankle boots rest on the cracked pavement.

### Scene 030: Putting On Helmet
**Time:** 8:53 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood street, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago lifts the red and black full-face helmet with both hands and pulls it down over his head. He adjusts the chin strap, clicking the buckle shut with a practiced snap. The dark visor is flipped up, revealing his brown face and dark eyes inside the helmet. The orange Rappi backpack is strapped tightly to his back. He swings one leg over the motorcycle seat, settling into position. His black gloved hands grip the handlebars. The motorcycle's mirrors reflect the Kennedy street behind him.

### Scene 031: Starting the Motorcycle
**Time:** 8:54 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood street, on motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago turns the motorcycle key in the ignition and presses the electric starter button on the right handlebar. The Honda CB 125 engine rumbles to life, a steady vibration through the seat. He revs the throttle once, the engine note rising. He checks both mirrors — the left shows the narrow street behind, the right shows a parked car and the tienda. He flips the dark visor down over his eyes. His black gloved hands rest on the clutch lever and brake lever. The dashboard gauges light up — fuel gauge, speedometer, odometer.

### Scene 032: Pulling into Traffic
**Time:** 8:55 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood street, riding
**Description:** Santiago eases the motorcycle into the street, the Honda CB 125 rolling forward as he releases the clutch and gives gentle throttle. He leans slightly as he navigates around a pothole in the cracked pavement. A yellow taxi passes in the opposite direction. The Kennedy neighborhood unfolds around him — rows of brick and concrete buildings, colorful painted facades, metal security doors, a few pedestrians on narrow sidewalks heading to work. The overcast Bogotá sky hangs gray above. The green mountains — the cerros — are hazy in the distance.

### Scene 033: First Traffic Light
**Time:** 8:58 AM
**Setting:** Busy intersection, Kennedy
**Description:** Santiago stops the motorcycle at a red traffic light at a busy Kennedy intersection. He puts one booted foot on the pavement for balance, the engine idling beneath him. Other motorcycles line up beside him — delivery riders from other apps, commuters, a man on a scooter. A red TransMilenio articulated bus rolls through on its dedicated lane, long and segmented. Pedestrians cross the crosswalk in front of him. A street vendor on the corner sells tinto from a cart with a large silver thermos, pouring small cups for waiting commuters. The traffic light hangs from a cable strung across the intersection.

### Scene 034: Weaving Through Traffic
**Time:** 9:02 AM
**Setting:** Major avenue (carrera), heading north
**Description:** Santiago rides the Honda CB 125 along a major avenue, weaving carefully between lanes of slow-moving traffic. Yellow taxis, sedans, buses, and other motorcycles fill the road. He signals with his left hand before changing lanes. The orange Rappi backpack is visible on his back. The avenue is lined with concrete and brick buildings — small shops, a panadería with bread visible in the window, a droguería (pharmacy) with a green cross sign, a cell phone repair shop with hand-painted signage. The TransMilenio dedicated lane runs along the center of the avenue with a station platform. The sky remains overcast and gray.

### Scene 035: First Delivery Pickup — Restaurant
**Time:** 9:08 AM
**Setting:** Outside a small restaurant, commercial street
**Description:** Santiago pulls the motorcycle up to the curb outside a small restaurant on a commercial street. He flips his visor up and checks his phone — the Rappi app shows the order details: restaurant name, customer address, estimated time. The restaurant has a simple storefront with a hand-painted sign, a glass door, and a menu board on the sidewalk. He swings his leg off the motorcycle, leaving the engine running, and walks toward the entrance with the orange Rappi backpack open and ready. A few plastic tables and chairs sit on the sidewalk outside the restaurant. The restaurant's fluorescent interior light spills out through the glass door.

---

## PART 5: MORNING DELIVERIES (9:10 AM - 12:30 PM)

### Scene 036: Picking Up First Order
**Time:** 9:10 AM
**Setting:** Inside small restaurant, at counter
**Description:** Santiago stands at the restaurant counter, orange Rappi backpack open on the counter beside him. A worker behind the counter hands him a white plastic bag tied at the top, heavy with food containers inside. Santiago checks the order on his phone screen, verifying the items listed in the app against the bag. He nods to the worker. The restaurant interior is simple — a few wooden tables, a glass display case with empanadas and other prepared foods, a counter with a cash register, fluorescent overhead lights, walls painted bright yellow with a menu handwritten on a whiteboard.

### Scene 037: Loading Backpack
**Time:** 9:12 AM
**Setting:** Outside restaurant, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago carefully places the white plastic bag of food into the orange Rappi insulated delivery backpack, adjusting it so the containers sit flat and will not tip during the ride. He zips the backpack closed and hoists it onto his back, tightening both straps. He checks the delivery address on his phone one more time, memorizing the route. The restaurant storefront is behind him. He straddles the motorcycle, flips the dark visor down, and grips the handlebars. A pedestrian walks past on the sidewalk carrying a grocery bag.

### Scene 038: Navigating to First Delivery
**Time:** 9:15 AM
**Setting:** Bogotá residential street, riding
**Description:** Santiago rides through a residential neighborhood, the Honda CB 125 humming on a quieter side street. He checks house numbers as he rides slowly — two-story and three-story brick buildings with numbered doors and barred windows. Laundry hangs from upper balconies. A woman sweeps the sidewalk in front of her house with a straw broom. A small tienda on the corner has bags of chips hanging in the window display and a Coca-Cola sign. The overcast sky creates flat, even lighting. The green cerros are visible at the end of the straight street.

### Scene 039: Arriving at Delivery Address
**Time:** 9:20 AM
**Setting:** Residential building entrance
**Description:** Santiago stops the motorcycle in front of a residential building and pulls out his phone. He taps the "arrived" button on the Rappi app and dials the customer's number. He stands beside the motorcycle, helmet visor flipped up, orange Rappi backpack on his back. The building entrance has a metal security gate with an intercom panel of numbered buttons. A potted plant sits beside the entrance. The building is three stories of red brick with small balconies. He holds the phone to his ear, waiting for the customer to answer.

### Scene 040: Handing Over Delivery
**Time:** 9:22 AM
**Setting:** Residential building entrance, at gate
**Description:** A customer appears at the metal security gate, opening it partially. Santiago holds out the white plastic bag of food with both hands, the Rappi backpack now open. The customer reaches through the gate to take the bag. Santiago's phone shows the delivery confirmation screen. He smiles — the delivery is complete. The motorcycle idles at the curb behind him. The narrow sidewalk has a concrete light pole and a small tree in a square of dirt. The building's red brick wall frames the scene.

### Scene 041: Confirming Delivery on App
**Time:** 9:24 AM
**Setting:** At motorcycle, residential street
**Description:** Santiago stands beside his motorcycle, tapping the "delivered" button on the Rappi app. The screen shows a green checkmark and the delivery earnings — a few thousand Colombian pesos. He checks for the next available order. The orange Rappi backpack hangs open and empty on his back. He takes a quick breath, adjusts his motorcycle gloves, and swings onto the bike. The residential street stretches ahead, quiet except for a passing car and a dog trotting on the sidewalk.

### Scene 042: Riding to Second Pickup
**Time:** 9:28 AM
**Setting:** Busy avenue, riding through traffic
**Description:** Santiago accelerates onto a busy avenue, merging into the flow of motorcycles and cars. The Honda CB 125 engine revs as he shifts gears. A yellow taxi honks to his left. He checks his left mirror and changes lanes smoothly. The avenue passes a large supermarket with a parking lot, a string of small shops with colorful signage, and a construction site with orange barriers and workers in hard hats. A TransMilenio bus stop has a crowd of people waiting behind glass dividers on the elevated platform. The Rappi backpack is flat against his back, empty and ready for the next order.

### Scene 043: Second Pickup — Bakery
**Time:** 9:35 AM
**Setting:** Outside a panadería (bakery), commercial street
**Description:** Santiago parks the motorcycle outside a panadería — a Colombian bakery with the warm smell of fresh bread drifting from the open door. The storefront has a glass display window showing trays of pan de bono (cheese bread), pandebono, buñuelos (cheese fritters), and pastries arranged in neat rows. A hand-painted sign above the door reads the bakery's name in bright letters. Santiago walks in with the Rappi backpack, phone in hand showing the order: a box of buñuelos and two café con leche for the customer. The sidewalk outside has a green metal bench and a trash bin.

### Scene 044: Waiting for Bakery Order
**Time:** 9:37 AM
**Setting:** Inside panadería, at counter
**Description:** Santiago leans against the bakery counter, phone in hand, waiting for the order to be prepared. A woman behind the counter uses tongs to place golden buñuelos into a paper box. Behind the glass display case, trays of bread and pastries are neatly arranged. Two tall paper cups of café con leche sit on the counter, lids already placed. The bakery interior has warm lighting, cream-colored walls, and a chalkboard menu listing prices in pesos. The smell of fresh bread fills the small space. Another customer browses the display case nearby.

### Scene 045: Loading Bakery Order
**Time:** 9:40 AM
**Setting:** Outside panadería, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago carefully places the paper box of buñuelos flat in the bottom of the orange Rappi backpack, then nestles the two paper cups of café con leche upright beside it, securing them so they will not spill. He zips the insulated backpack closed. The warmth of the fresh buñuelos radiates through the backpack fabric. He pulls the backpack on, tightens the straps, and mounts the motorcycle. The bakery's glass window glows warm behind him. A motorcyclist passes on the street.

### Scene 046: Delivery Through Neighborhood
**Time:** 9:45 AM
**Setting:** Narrow residential street, riding
**Description:** Santiago navigates a narrow residential street, the motorcycle rolling at a moderate pace over uneven pavement. He carefully avoids a pothole near a storm drain. The street is lined with two-story houses painted in faded pastels — green, blue, yellow — with metal security doors and barred windows. An elderly man sits in a plastic chair outside his door. A stray dog trots along the gutter. Small Colombian flags hang from a string between two buildings, left over from a recent holiday. The mountains are hidden behind the buildings and the overcast sky.

### Scene 047: Second Delivery Complete
**Time:** 9:52 AM
**Setting:** Apartment building lobby, at door
**Description:** Santiago hands the paper box and the two café con leche cups to a smiling customer at the door of an apartment building lobby. The customer holds the door open with one foot while taking the items. Santiago's phone shows the delivery confirmation. The lobby is simple — tile floor, a staircase leading up, a row of metal mailboxes on the wall. A fluorescent light illuminates the space. Santiago nods politely as the customer thanks him. The orange Rappi backpack is empty again on his back.

### Scene 048: Quick Break — Tinto Cart
**Time:** 10:00 AM
**Setting:** Street corner, at tinto cart
**Description:** Santiago stands beside his parked motorcycle at a street corner, holding a small plastic cup of tinto — hot, sweet black coffee — purchased from a tinto cart vendor. The tinto cart is a metal pushcart with a large silver thermos, a stack of small plastic cups, a sugar container, and a hand-written price sign. The vendor, an older man in a cap and apron, pours another cup for another customer. Santiago sips the tinto, helmet resting on the motorcycle seat, visor flipped up. The bitter-sweet coffee is strong and warming. Traffic passes on the street behind him. A street mural depicting colorful tropical birds covers the wall of a building across the street.

### Scene 049: Accepting Third Order
**Time:** 10:05 AM
**Setting:** Street corner, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago crushes the empty plastic tinto cup and drops it in a trash bin on the corner. He pulls out his phone and sees a new Rappi order notification pop up. He taps "accept" — the pickup is at a chicken restaurant five minutes away. The order details show: a quarter chicken with rice, beans, and fried plantain. He tucks the phone into the mount clipped to the motorcycle handlebar, the map navigation starting. He puts on the helmet, clips the chin strap, flips the visor down, and starts the motorcycle engine.

### Scene 050: Riding Past Street Art
**Time:** 10:08 AM
**Setting:** Urban avenue, riding
**Description:** Santiago rides along an avenue where a long concrete wall is covered in elaborate street art — a mural of a giant hummingbird in blues and greens, the Colombian flag woven into abstract geometric patterns, and a portrait of a woman's face surrounded by flowers. The bright colors contrast with the gray overcast sky above. The Honda CB 125 passes in front of the mural, Santiago's orange Rappi backpack and red-black helmet creating splashes of color against the art. A few pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, one taking a photo of the mural with a phone. A yellow taxi waits at the curb.

### Scene 051: Third Pickup — Chicken Restaurant
**Time:** 10:12 AM
**Setting:** Chicken restaurant storefront, commercial strip
**Description:** Santiago parks the motorcycle outside a pollo asado restaurant with a large rotating chicken sign above the door. Through the glass window, whole chickens rotate on a vertical spit, their golden-brown skin glistening. He walks inside with the Rappi backpack. The restaurant smells of roasted chicken and charcoal. A counter attendant in a white apron prepares the order — a quarter chicken, yellow rice, red beans, and fried plantain in a styrofoam container. A chalkboard menu on the wall lists combo meals in Spanish. Plastic tables with red checkered cloths fill the small dining area.

### Scene 052: Careful Loading — Hot Food
**Time:** 10:15 AM
**Setting:** Outside chicken restaurant, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago places the warm styrofoam container carefully into the orange Rappi insulated backpack, making sure it sits flat. He adds a small plastic bag with napkins and a tiny container of ají (hot sauce) that the restaurant included. He zips the backpack tightly, the insulated walls keeping the heat in. The aroma of roasted chicken lingers. He mounts the motorcycle, checks the delivery address on the phone mount, and starts the engine. A bus rumbles past on the avenue, its diesel exhaust puffing gray.

### Scene 053: Navigating a Roundabout
**Time:** 10:20 AM
**Setting:** Busy roundabout, riding
**Description:** Santiago enters a busy roundabout, merging carefully into the circling traffic. Yellow taxis, a large cargo truck, motorcycles, and a city bus all rotate around the center island, which has a small monument and a patch of green grass. He signals and takes the second exit, leaning the motorcycle slightly into the curve. His left mirror shows a delivery motorcycle from another app close behind. The roundabout is surrounded by mid-rise commercial buildings, a bank branch, and a mobile phone store with large banners. Traffic flows in organized chaos.

### Scene 054: Third Delivery — Office Building
**Time:** 10:28 AM
**Setting:** Office building entrance, commercial area
**Description:** Santiago pulls up to a modern office building with a glass entrance and a security guard standing outside in a dark uniform. He dismounts, visor up, and checks the Rappi app — the customer will come down to the lobby. He waits near the entrance, the styrofoam container in a plastic bag held in one hand, orange Rappi backpack open. The office building has six floors with tinted windows. Workers in business clothes walk in and out through the glass doors. A small garden with trimmed hedges lines the entrance walkway.

### Scene 055: Handing Over to Office Worker
**Time:** 10:30 AM
**Setting:** Office building lobby entrance
**Description:** A young woman in business attire steps out of the glass doors and approaches Santiago. He hands her the plastic bag containing the chicken lunch, and she thanks him. Santiago shows her the Rappi app confirmation on his phone screen. She nods and walks back inside. He taps "delivered" on the app — another order complete, another few thousand pesos earned. The security guard watches from his post. Santiago walks back to the motorcycle, pulling on his gloves.

### Scene 056: Checking Earnings
**Time:** 10:33 AM
**Setting:** Parked at curb, commercial area
**Description:** Santiago sits on the motorcycle at the curb, engine off, helmet resting on the fuel tank. He holds his phone, scrolling through the Rappi app earnings screen. The morning total shows the earnings from three completed deliveries. He calculates mentally — a decent start, but he needs more to cover rent and save for new DJ equipment. He checks for new orders. The commercial street buzzes around him — cars, pedestrians, a fruit vendor pushing a cart with stacked papayas, mangoes, and bananas. The overcast sky has brightened slightly.

### Scene 057: Fourth Pickup — Empanada Stand
**Time:** 10:40 AM
**Setting:** Street empanada stand
**Description:** Santiago stops at a street-side empanada stand — a metal cart with a large flat frying pan of oil, where golden empanadas sizzle. The vendor, a woman in an apron and hairnet, uses tongs to flip the empanadas. A hand-painted sign lists types: carne (beef), pollo (chicken), queso (cheese), with prices in pesos. The Rappi order is for a dozen mixed empanadas. Santiago watches as the vendor places hot empanadas into a paper-lined box. The smell of frying dough and spiced meat fills the air. Steam rises from the oil. A squeeze bottle of ají verde (green hot sauce) sits on the cart's counter.

### Scene 058: Empanada Delivery — Residential
**Time:** 10:52 AM
**Setting:** Residential apartment, at door
**Description:** Santiago climbs to the second floor of a residential building, carrying the box of empanadas in both hands. The narrow stairwell has worn concrete steps and a metal railing. He knocks on a green-painted metal door. A man opens it, the sound of a television playing inside. Santiago hands over the warm box of empanadas. The hallway smells of cooking from other apartments. The fluorescent hallway light casts a flat glow. He checks the delivery confirmation on his phone, nods, and heads back down the stairs, boots echoing on the concrete.

### Scene 059: Riding Through Ciclovía Area
**Time:** 11:00 AM
**Setting:** Avenue with ciclovía lane, riding
**Description:** Santiago rides along an avenue that has a marked ciclovía lane — a dedicated bicycle path separated from traffic by painted lines and small plastic bollards. Cyclists pedal in the lane — commuters, a man on a cargo bike with boxes, a woman on a mountain bike. Santiago stays in the motorcycle lane to the left, respecting the ciclovía boundary. The avenue passes a park with tall eucalyptus trees and green grass. A few joggers run on a dirt path in the park. The Bogotá skyline of office towers is visible in the distance, partially obscured by gray clouds.

### Scene 060: Fifth Order — Juice Bar
**Time:** 11:10 AM
**Setting:** Juice bar storefront
**Description:** Santiago enters a small juice bar with a bright green facade and a hand-painted sign reading "Jugos Naturales." The interior has a long counter with a glass display of whole fruits — mangoes, papayas, lulo (a Colombian citrus fruit), maracuyá (passion fruit), guanábana, and strawberries. Industrial blenders sit on the counter behind. A worker in a green apron blends a smoothie, the blender whirring loudly. Santiago's order is for two large fresh juices — one mango, one lulo — in sealed plastic cups with lids and straws. He waits, phone in hand, the Rappi backpack on the counter.

### Scene 061: Securing Juice Cups
**Time:** 11:14 AM
**Setting:** Outside juice bar, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago places the two large sealed plastic cups of fresh juice into the Rappi backpack, fitting them upright and wedging them with the insulated walls so they will not tip. He tucks a few napkins around them for extra stability. The cups are cold and condensation beads on the plastic. He zips the backpack carefully and lifts it onto his back. The juice bar's green facade is behind him. A mother and child walk past on the sidewalk, the child pointing at the motorcycle.

### Scene 062: Delivery to Apartment Tower
**Time:** 11:22 AM
**Setting:** Apartment tower entrance, at security desk
**Description:** Santiago walks into the lobby of a taller apartment tower — ten floors, modern with a marble-tile floor and a security desk. The security guard asks for his ID and the apartment number. Santiago shows the Rappi app on his phone. The guard nods and gestures toward the elevator. Santiago waits in the lobby instead — many riders prefer not to go upstairs. The customer comes down a minute later, a university-age woman with a backpack, who takes the two juice cups gratefully. The lobby has a potted palm tree and a bulletin board with building notices.

### Scene 063: Quick Phone Call — Mom
**Time:** 11:28 AM
**Setting:** Parked on side street, on motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago sits on his parked motorcycle on a quiet side street, helmet on the seat beside him. He holds his phone to his ear, calling his mamá Gloria. He asks if everything is okay at home in Soacha, asks about his sister Camila's school, and tells his mom he will visit on Sunday. His expression is warm and soft — different from his focused delivery-rider face. The narrow street has a few parked cars and a small park with a bench and a tree. The overcast sky has broken slightly, a patch of pale blue visible.

### Scene 064: Accepting Sixth Order
**Time:** 11:35 AM
**Setting:** Side street, on motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago ends the call with his mom and immediately sees a new Rappi notification. He taps "accept" — the pickup is at a pizza place nearby. He puts on the helmet, clips the strap, and starts the engine. The side street connects to a busier road ahead. He pulls out, checking mirrors. A group of schoolchildren in uniforms walks on the sidewalk with a teacher, heading toward a park. The children carry small backpacks in various colors. Santiago waits for them to pass before accelerating.

### Scene 065: Pizza Pickup
**Time:** 11:42 AM
**Setting:** Pizza restaurant, at counter
**Description:** Santiago stands at the counter of a small pizza restaurant, the orange Rappi backpack open on the counter. A worker slides a flat square pizza box across the counter — the box is warm, grease spots forming on the bottom. The restaurant has a brick oven visible in the back, red and white checkered decor, and a neon "PIZZA" sign in the window. Santiago tucks the pizza box flat in the backpack, the insulated walls wrapping it snugly. The smell of melted cheese and tomato sauce fills the air. He zips the backpack and heads for the door.

### Scene 066: Riding with Pizza — Careful Cornering
**Time:** 11:48 AM
**Setting:** Residential street, riding
**Description:** Santiago rides through a residential neighborhood, taking corners slowly and gently to keep the pizza flat in the backpack. The Honda CB 125 leans only slightly into the turns. Speed bumps force him to slow to a crawl, the motorcycle bouncing gently over the yellow-painted concrete humps. The neighborhood has tree-lined streets, painted walls, and a few dogs napping in the shade of doorways. A woman hangs laundry on a line strung between her house and a pole. The smell of fresh laundry mixes with the warm pizza aroma.

### Scene 067: Pizza Delivery — Family Home
**Time:** 11:55 AM
**Setting:** Family home, at front door
**Description:** Santiago stands at the front door of a modest family home — a single-story brick house with a small garden of potted flowers behind a low wall. He holds the pizza box with both hands. A man opens the door, two small children visible behind him jumping with excitement at the sight of the pizza box. Santiago hands the box over with a smile. The children cheer. He taps "delivered" on his phone as he walks back to the motorcycle. The family home has a colorful front door — bright red — and a Colombian flag sticker on the window.

### Scene 068: Midday Traffic Jam
**Time:** 12:05 PM
**Setting:** Major avenue, stuck in traffic
**Description:** Santiago sits on the idling motorcycle in heavy midday traffic on a major avenue. Cars, taxis, and buses are bumper to bumper, barely moving. Exhaust fumes shimmer in the air. He filters slowly between the lanes, the motorcycle narrow enough to squeeze through gaps. Other delivery riders do the same — a Rappi rider on a bicycle, an iFood rider on a scooter. The TransMilenio bus lane to the right moves faster, a red bus gliding past the gridlock. A traffic officer in a reflective vest stands at the next intersection, directing traffic with hand signals.

### Scene 069: Stopping for Gas
**Time:** 12:15 PM
**Setting:** Gas station, at pump
**Description:** Santiago pulls the Honda CB 125 up to a gas pump at a small Terpel gas station. He removes the gas cap and inserts the nozzle, filling the small tank. The digital display on the pump ticks upward — showing liters and pesos. A gas station attendant in a red Terpel uniform stands nearby, ready to help. The gas station has a small convenience store (tienda de conveniencia) with a glass door, a rack of snacks and drinks visible inside. Other vehicles — a taxi, a truck — fill up at adjacent pumps. Santiago watches the gauge, stopping at a round number of pesos.

### Scene 070: Paying for Gas
**Time:** 12:18 PM
**Setting:** Gas station, at attendant
**Description:** Santiago pulls a folded bill from his jeans pocket and hands it to the gas station attendant. The attendant makes change from a leather waist pouch. Santiago tucks the change back in his pocket and replaces the gas cap on the motorcycle. He checks the fuel gauge on the dashboard — full. The Terpel station canopy provides shade from the overcast sky. A small line of cars waits behind. Santiago mounts the bike and rides toward the station exit, passing the convenience store and an air pump for tires.

## PART 6: LUNCH BREAK (12:30 PM - 1:15 PM)

### Scene 071: Parking for Lunch
**Time:** 12:30 PM
**Setting:** Side street near corrientazo restaurant, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago parks the Honda CB 125 on a side street near a corrientazo restaurant — a cheap Colombian set-lunch spot popular with workers. He removes his helmet and hangs it on the motorcycle mirror. The orange Rappi backpack comes off his back and he loops one strap around the mirror as well for security. He unzips the motorcycle jacket partway — it is warm despite the overcast sky. The restaurant has a simple open-air entrance with a hand-painted sign listing today's menu: soup, rice, beans, meat, plantain, salad, juice — one price.

### Scene 072: Entering Corrientazo Restaurant
**Time:** 12:32 PM
**Setting:** Corrientazo restaurant entrance
**Description:** Santiago steps into the corrientazo restaurant through the open-air entrance. The small space has six plastic tables with plastic chairs, most occupied by workers — construction workers in dusty clothes, a taxi driver, other delivery riders with their app-branded backpacks nearby. A large serving counter at the back has metal pans of food — yellow rice, red beans (frijoles), stewed beef (carne guisada), fried plantain (tajadas), a green salad, and a large pot of soup (sopa del día). A woman behind the counter serves plates. The walls are painted bright blue with a clock and a small TV playing a news channel.

### Scene 073: Ordering Corrientazo Lunch
**Time:** 12:34 PM
**Setting:** Corrientazo restaurant, at counter
**Description:** Santiago stands at the serving counter, pointing to indicate his choices. The woman behind the counter places a large oval plate and begins serving — a scoop of yellow rice, a ladle of red beans, a piece of stewed beef, two slices of fried plantain (tajadas), and a small mound of green salad with sliced tomato. She hands him a bowl of the soup of the day — chicken and potato (ajiaco-style). A tall glass of fresh juice (jugo de lulo) is poured from a pitcher. Santiago carries the tray with both hands to a free table.

### Scene 074: Eating Lunch — Soup First
**Time:** 12:37 PM
**Setting:** Corrientazo restaurant, seated at table
**Description:** Santiago sits at a plastic table, spooning the hot chicken and potato soup from the bowl. The soup is thick, with chunks of potato and shredded chicken, a slice of corn on the cob visible. Steam rises from the surface. His large oval plate of rice, beans, beef, plantain, and salad waits beside it. The glass of lulo juice sweats with condensation. A metal napkin dispenser and a squeeze bottle of ají (hot sauce) sit on the table. He eats hungrily — the morning deliveries have built an appetite. His phone rests face-up on the table, Rappi app paused.

### Scene 075: Main Course — Rice, Beans, Meat
**Time:** 12:42 PM
**Setting:** Corrientazo restaurant, seated at table
**Description:** Santiago digs into the main plate with a fork and knife, cutting a piece of the stewed beef and eating it with a forkful of yellow rice and red beans. The fried plantain slices are sweet and golden, and he eats one between bites. The green salad with sliced tomato and a drizzle of lime juice sits untouched for now. He takes a long drink of the lulo juice — tangy and refreshing. The TV on the wall shows a soccer match highlight. Another delivery rider at the next table eats the same corrientazo, helmet on the chair beside him.

### Scene 076: Scrolling Phone During Lunch
**Time:** 12:48 PM
**Setting:** Corrientazo restaurant, seated at table
**Description:** Santiago leans back in the plastic chair, the plate mostly empty now — a few grains of rice and a smear of beans remaining. He holds his phone, scrolling through Instagram. He watches a short video of a DJ performing at a club, the DJ's hands moving across a controller similar to his own. His expression is focused, studying the technique. The lulo juice glass is half-empty. The corrientazo restaurant bustles around him — plates clattering, conversation in Spanish, the TV news anchor speaking. He saves the DJ video to watch again later.

### Scene 077: Paying for Lunch
**Time:** 12:55 PM
**Setting:** Corrientazo restaurant, at counter
**Description:** Santiago stands at the counter, pulling folded peso bills from his front jeans pocket. He hands the bills to the woman behind the counter, who makes change from a small plastic tray. The corrientazo price is written on a whiteboard behind her — affordable for a working rider. He drops a small tip on the counter. The empty plate and soup bowl have been cleared. He nods goodbye to the woman and another delivery rider he exchanged a few words with during the meal. The restaurant is still busy with the lunch rush.

### Scene 078: Post-Lunch Stretch
**Time:** 12:58 PM
**Setting:** Sidewalk outside corrientazo restaurant
**Description:** Santiago stands on the sidewalk outside the corrientazo restaurant, stretching his arms overhead and rolling his neck. The motorcycle jacket is unzipped, showing the black hoodie underneath. His stomach is full from the hearty lunch. He takes a deep breath of the Bogotá air — cool and slightly humid. The side street has a few parked cars and motorcycles. A tienda next to the restaurant has its door open, shelves of snacks, drinks, and household items visible inside. A hand-painted Coca-Cola advertisement covers one side wall of the tienda.

### Scene 079: Buying Water at Tienda
**Time:** 1:00 PM
**Setting:** Tienda, at counter
**Description:** Santiago steps into the small tienda beside the restaurant. The narrow shop is packed from floor to ceiling — shelves hold bags of chips, cookies, cleaning products, canned goods, and candy. A refrigerated glass-door cooler at the back holds bottles of water, soda, and beer. Santiago pulls a cold bottle of water from the cooler and takes it to the counter. The tienda owner — a middle-aged man behind a counter protected by a glass partition with a small opening — rings up the purchase. Santiago pays with coins. A radio plays vallenato music softly from a small speaker on a shelf.

### Scene 080: Back on the Motorcycle
**Time:** 1:05 PM
**Setting:** Side street, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago takes a long drink from the cold water bottle, then caps it and tucks it into a side pocket of the Rappi backpack. He puts on the motorcycle jacket fully, zipping it up, and grabs the red and black helmet from the mirror. He settles the Rappi backpack on his back and mounts the Honda CB 125. He checks the Rappi app — the lunch rush means plenty of orders. He accepts the next one, a restaurant seven minutes away. The engine starts with a rumble, and he pulls into the street.

---

## PART 7: AFTERNOON DELIVERIES (1:10 PM - 5:30 PM)

### Scene 081: Afternoon Pickup — Arepa Restaurant
**Time:** 1:15 PM
**Setting:** Arepa restaurant, at counter
**Description:** Santiago picks up an order at a small arepa restaurant — the counter displays rows of golden arepas stuffed with various fillings behind glass. The order is for three arepas de choclo (sweet corn arepas) with cheese. A woman wraps them in foil and places them in a paper bag. The restaurant walls are painted warm orange, with photos of different arepa varieties displayed. Santiago places the warm bag in the Rappi backpack, the sweet corn smell filling his nostrils. A glass pitcher of aguapanela (sugarcane water) sits on the counter for customers.

### Scene 082: Delivery to University Area
**Time:** 1:28 PM
**Setting:** University neighborhood, at building entrance
**Description:** Santiago delivers the arepas to a student waiting outside a building near a university campus. The student wears a university hoodie and carries a backpack covered in pins. The neighborhood has a youthful energy — a bookstore with stacked displays in the window, a copy shop with printed banners, a cafeteria with outdoor seating where students study with laptops. The street is lined with old trees. Santiago recognizes the student energy — he briefly considered university but chose to work and save. He taps "delivered" and rides on.

### Scene 083: Rain Begins
**Time:** 1:45 PM
**Setting:** Avenue, riding in light rain
**Description:** Light rain begins to fall on Bogotá — a typical afternoon drizzle. Santiago rides the motorcycle with raindrops speckling his dark visor. He flips the visor partially up to see better. The road surface glistens with water, reflecting the brake lights of cars ahead. Pedestrians open umbrellas on the sidewalk. A few dash into doorways for cover. The Honda CB 125's tires roll through shallow puddles. Santiago rides more cautiously in the rain, keeping extra distance from the yellow taxi ahead. The green mountains disappear behind a curtain of gray rain clouds.

### Scene 084: Rain Delivery — Covered Entrance
**Time:** 2:00 PM
**Setting:** Building with covered entrance, in rain
**Description:** Santiago pulls under a building's covered entrance overhang, sheltering from the rain while delivering an order. Water drips from his helmet and the tips of his motorcycle gloves. The orange Rappi backpack has water beading on its insulated surface. He hands a bag of food to a customer who stepped into the covered entrance. The rain falls steadily beyond the overhang, creating a curtain of water. Puddles form on the sidewalk. The motorcycle is parked just under the overhang, its chrome mirrors beaded with raindrops.

### Scene 085: Riding in Heavier Rain
**Time:** 2:15 PM
**Setting:** Avenue, riding in rain
**Description:** The rain intensifies and Santiago rides more slowly through the wet streets. His motorcycle jacket's reflective strips gleam in the headlights of oncoming cars. Water sprays from the front tire. He grips the handlebars firmly through the wet gloves. The avenue's traffic has slowed — cars have their headlights on, wipers sweeping. A TransMilenio bus splashes through a large puddle in its dedicated lane. Street vendors have covered their carts with plastic sheets. Santiago presses on — rainy days mean more orders, as people do not want to go out.

### Scene 086: Brief Shelter — Under Bridge
**Time:** 2:30 PM
**Setting:** Under a highway overpass, parked
**Description:** Santiago pulls the motorcycle under a highway overpass, joining several other motorcyclists sheltering from a heavy downpour. The concrete overpass provides a dry strip above, while rain pours down on either side like waterfalls. He removes his helmet, running a hand over his wet hair. Other delivery riders check their phones. A street vendor has set up under the overpass selling empanadas from a small cart, taking advantage of the captive audience. Santiago checks the Rappi app — three more orders waiting. The rain on the road creates a rushing sound. His boots are damp but not soaked.

### Scene 087: Rain Easing — Back on the Road
**Time:** 2:45 PM
**Setting:** Avenue, riding as rain clears
**Description:** The rain eases to a light mist and Santiago rides back onto the avenue. The wet road reflects the gray sky and the colored lights of shop signs. Everything looks freshly washed — the green of park trees is more vivid, the painted buildings brighter. A double rainbow arcs faintly over the cerros in the east. Santiago accelerates gradually, the Honda CB 125 engine humming. His visor is clear now. Puddles dot the road but traffic is moving again. A few other delivery riders emerge from shelters and rejoin the flow.

### Scene 088: Afternoon Delivery — Pharmacy Items
**Time:** 3:00 PM
**Setting:** Droguería (pharmacy), at counter
**Description:** Santiago picks up an unusual Rappi order — not food, but pharmacy items from a droguería. The small pharmacy has a glass counter with medicine shelves behind it, a green cross neon sign in the window, and a pharmacist in a white coat. The order is a bag of items — cold medicine, a box of tissues, and throat lozenges. Santiago places the small white plastic bag in the Rappi backpack. Rappi delivers more than food — medicine, groceries, anything. He tucks the receipt into the bag and heads out. The pharmacy's fluorescent lights are bright and clinical.

### Scene 089: Pharmacy Delivery — Apartment
**Time:** 3:12 PM
**Setting:** Apartment entrance, at intercom
**Description:** Santiago presses the intercom button at an apartment building entrance, the small speaker crackling. A voice answers and buzzes the door open. He enters the lobby — clean tile floor, a small table with a vase of artificial flowers, an elevator with metal doors. He takes the elevator to the fourth floor, the Rappi backpack on his back. A woman in a bathrobe opens the apartment door, sniffling with a cold. He hands her the pharmacy bag. She thanks him hoarsely. He nods sympathetically and heads back to the elevator. The delivery app confirms the order.

### Scene 090: Mid-Afternoon — Tinto Break
**Time:** 3:25 PM
**Setting:** Street corner, at tinto vendor cart
**Description:** Santiago stops for another tinto at a different street corner vendor. This cart is slightly larger, with a red-and-yellow striped umbrella for shade. The vendor pours the hot black coffee from a silver thermos into a small plastic cup, adding two spoonfuls of sugar without asking — Bogotá tinto is always sweet. Santiago leans against his parked motorcycle, sipping the hot coffee, watching the afternoon traffic flow. The post-rain air is cool and fresh. A man at a nearby newspaper stand flips through headlines. The sidewalk has a row of potted plants outside a hair salon.

### Scene 091: Grocery Store Pickup
**Time:** 3:40 PM
**Setting:** Small supermarket, at entrance
**Description:** Santiago enters a small neighborhood supermarket — Éxito Express — with fluorescent lighting and narrow aisles stacked with products. A Rappi order for groceries: a bag of rice, a bottle of cooking oil, a bunch of bananas, and a carton of eggs. He navigates the aisles with a small hand basket, picking items from the shelves. The supermarket has a produce section at the front with stacked fruits and vegetables — green plantains, ripe yellow bananas, red tomatoes, white onions. Muzak plays softly overhead. He checks items against the app list on his phone.

### Scene 092: Checkout and Loading
**Time:** 3:48 PM
**Setting:** Small supermarket, at checkout
**Description:** Santiago places the grocery items on the checkout conveyor — rice bag, cooking oil bottle, bananas, and egg carton. The cashier scans each item with a barcode reader. The total appears on a small screen. Santiago pays using the Rappi app payment method — the app covers grocery orders. He bags the items carefully in a plastic bag, placing the egg carton on top so it will not be crushed. Outside, he loads everything into the Rappi backpack, keeping the eggs protected. The supermarket entrance has shopping carts stacked to one side and promotional posters on the glass doors.

### Scene 093: Grocery Delivery — Walk-Up
**Time:** 4:00 PM
**Setting:** Residential house, at front door
**Description:** Santiago walks up to a residential house carrying the plastic bag of groceries in both arms — the rice bag is heavy. The house has a small front yard with a low brick wall and an iron gate. An older woman opens the gate and the front door, thanking Santiago profusely. He sets the grocery bag on a small table just inside the door. The house interior is visible briefly — tile floors, a religious painting on the wall, a potted fern. The woman offers him a glass of water, which he politely declines. He confirms the delivery on his phone and heads back to the motorcycle.

### Scene 094: Late Afternoon Orders Slow Down
**Time:** 4:20 PM
**Setting:** Parked on residential street, on motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago sits on his parked motorcycle, scrolling through the Rappi app. Orders have slowed in the late afternoon — the gap between lunch rush and dinner. He takes the opportunity to rest, removing his helmet and setting it on the fuel tank. He drinks from his water bottle. The late afternoon light has shifted — the overcast sky has thinned, and warm golden light breaks through, casting long shadows on the street. He checks his total earnings for the day so far, doing mental math. A cat watches him from a windowsill across the street.

### Scene 095: WhatsApp with DJ Friend
**Time:** 4:28 PM
**Setting:** Parked on residential street, on motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago types a WhatsApp message on his phone, chatting with his friend Carlos — another aspiring DJ. They discuss tonight's plan — Carlos got them a small gig at a bar in the Chapinero neighborhood. Santiago grins, excited. He sends a fire emoji and a headphone emoji. The WhatsApp chat shows previous messages about music tracks and set lists. The phone screen reflects off his dark brown eyes. The late afternoon golden light warms the scene. His silver chain necklace glints. The motorcycle engine is off, cooling in the shade of a building.

### Scene 096: One More Delivery — Coffee Shop
**Time:** 4:45 PM
**Setting:** Specialty coffee shop, at counter
**Description:** Santiago picks up an order at a small specialty coffee shop — a fancier place than the tinto carts, with exposed brick walls, wooden shelves of coffee bags from different Colombian regions, and a gleaming espresso machine. The order is for two iced lattes in clear plastic cups. The barista — a young woman in a black apron — hands the cups across the counter. Santiago places them carefully in the insulated Rappi backpack. The coffee shop has a chalkboard menu with drinks in both Spanish and English. Soft jazz plays from a small speaker.

### Scene 097: Final Afternoon Delivery
**Time:** 5:00 PM
**Setting:** Co-working space lobby
**Description:** Santiago delivers the two iced lattes to a young man in a co-working space lobby — a modern space with glass walls, a reception desk, and people visible at desks with laptops inside. The customer takes the drinks and waves thanks. Santiago taps "delivered" — his last order before heading home. The co-working space has motivational quotes painted on the walls and a small lounge area with colorful bean bag chairs. The contrast between this modern workspace and Santiago's street-level hustle is visible but he does not dwell on it. He heads for the exit.

### Scene 098: Riding Home — Golden Hour
**Time:** 5:15 PM
**Setting:** Avenue, riding toward Kennedy, golden hour
**Description:** Santiago rides the Honda CB 125 toward home, heading south toward the Kennedy neighborhood. The late afternoon sun breaks through the clouds, casting golden light across Bogotá. The cerros — the green eastern mountains — glow warm in the low light. The avenue is busy with rush-hour traffic but flowing. Santiago's motorcycle jacket reflective strips catch the golden light. The orange Rappi backpack is empty and light on his back. He rides relaxed now — the work portion of his day is nearly done. Shop lights begin to turn on along the avenue as dusk approaches.

### Scene 099: Arriving at Kennedy — Neighborhood Streets
**Time:** 5:35 PM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood street, riding
**Description:** Santiago turns onto the familiar Kennedy neighborhood streets, the motorcycle humming at a lower speed. He passes the tienda where he sometimes buys minutes for his phone, the panadería where he gets bread, the corner where neighborhood guys play micro-fútbol on a small concrete court. Kids kick a ball on the sidewalk. A woman calls out from a window above to a child playing below. The neighborhood has a lived-in warmth — faded paint, metal doors, laundry lines, stray dogs, the smell of cooking from open windows. Santiago waves to a neighbor sitting on a plastic chair outside her door.

### Scene 100: Parking and Chaining Motorcycle
**Time:** 5:40 PM
**Setting:** Outside shared house, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago parks the Honda CB 125 in its usual spot against the curb near the shared house. He swings off, removes the helmet, and ruffles his sweaty hair. He opens the seat compartment, pulls out the heavy chain and lock, and threads the chain through the rear wheel and around the metal post, clicking the lock shut. The motorcycle is secure for the evening. He picks up the helmet, the empty Rappi backpack, and heads for the dark green metal security door. The Kennedy street is quieter now in the early evening. A street light flickers on above.

## PART 8: EVENING — RETURN HOME (5:42 PM - 6:30 PM)

### Scene 101: Entering the House
**Time:** 5:42 PM
**Setting:** Shared house hallway
**Description:** Santiago steps through the heavy dark green metal security door into the narrow hallway of the shared house. He carries the motorcycle helmet under his arm and the empty Rappi backpack by its top handle. The hallway overhead bulb is on. He can hear music playing softly from one of the housemate's rooms — cumbia from a phone speaker. The communal shoe tray near the entrance has a few pairs of shoes in it. Santiago kicks off his black ankle boots and places them in the tray. The cool gray tile feels good on his socked feet after a long day in boots.

### Scene 102: Entering His Room — Dropping Gear
**Time:** 5:44 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room
**Description:** Santiago pushes open his bedroom door and drops the motorcycle helmet onto the wall hook by the door with a practiced toss. The orange Rappi backpack goes against the wall in its usual spot. He hangs the motorcycle jacket on the nail. The room is as he left it — bed unmade, DJ controller and laptop on the folding table, fan on the floor. He unzips the black hoodie, pulling it off and tossing it onto the bed. He stretches his arms, rolling his shoulders — stiff from hours of riding. The evening light through the thin beige curtains is warm and golden.

### Scene 103: Checking Earnings — Total for Day
**Time:** 5:46 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, sitting on bed
**Description:** Santiago sits on the edge of the bed in his dark blue jeans and a black t-shirt (the hoodie removed), holding his phone. He opens the Rappi app and scrolls to the earnings summary. The screen shows the day's total — number of deliveries completed, total pesos earned, tips received. He nods, satisfied — a decent day. He opens the calculator app and subtracts gas, phone data, and lunch cost. The remaining amount goes toward rent and his DJ equipment fund. The small digital alarm clock on the crate nightstand shows 5:46 PM.

### Scene 104: Video Calling Sister
**Time:** 5:50 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, sitting on bed
**Description:** Santiago holds his phone in front of his face, video-calling his younger sister Camila on WhatsApp. The screen shows a 15-year-old girl in a school uniform, smiling and talking animatedly. Santiago grins back, asking about her school day. She shows him a drawing she made in art class. He gives a thumbs up. The video call interface shows their faces side by side. The thin beige curtains glow with the warm evening light behind him. His silver chain necklace is visible at his t-shirt collar. The DJ controller on the folding table is visible in the background of his video frame.

### Scene 105: Grabbing Towel and Toiletries
**Time:** 5:55 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at closet
**Description:** Santiago ends the video call and stands up, grabbing the blue towel from where he left it draped on the bed earlier. He picks up the plastic toiletries basket from the closet area. He grabs a fresh casual outfit from the closet — gray jogger pants and a white t-shirt — draping them over his arm. He needs a shower after a full day of riding in the Bogotá heat and rain. He steps out of the room, leaving the door ajar, and heads down the hallway to the shared bathroom. The hallway is quiet now, the cumbia music having stopped.

---

## PART 9: EVENING — BATHROOM (5:57 PM - 6:25 PM)

### Scene 106: Evening Shower — Entering Bathroom
**Time:** 5:57 PM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom
**Description:** Santiago enters the shared bathroom for his evening shower. The fluorescent tube light flickers on. The bathroom is clean — a housemate has wiped the sink. He places his toiletries basket on the shelf, the casual clothes folded on the closed toilet lid behind the partition wall, and hangs the blue towel on the hook. He turns the shower handle and tests the water temperature — the water heater takes a moment. Steam begins to rise. The frosted glass window near the ceiling shows the darkening evening sky outside.

### Scene 107: Post-Shower — Mirror
**Time:** 6:10 PM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago stands at the mirror, blue towel wrapped around his waist, another smaller towel draped over one shoulder. His short dark hair is wet and glistening. Water droplets run down his brown skin. The mirror is half-fogged from the shower steam, and he wipes a clear patch with his palm. His reflection shows a tired but satisfied young face — dark brown eyes, the thin silver chain necklace wet against his collarbone. The fluorescent light casts even white light. His toiletries basket is open on the shelf — soap bar wet, shampoo bottle recapped.

### Scene 108: Shaving
**Time:** 6:12 PM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago spreads shaving cream from the can onto his chin and jaw with his right hand, then picks up the disposable razor with practiced ease. He tilts his head back slightly, drawing the razor along his jawline in smooth downward strokes. The mirror reflects his focused expression. Shaving cream and stubble accumulate on the razor blade, which he rinses under the running chrome faucet between strokes. He has a gig tonight and wants to look sharp. A small spot of shaving cream sits on his earlobe unnoticed. The fluorescent light provides clear, even illumination for shaving.

### Scene 109: Rinsing Face
**Time:** 6:15 PM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Santiago cups water from the chrome faucet and splashes it across his freshly shaved face, rinsing away the remaining shaving cream. He pats his face dry with the small towel from his shoulder. His jawline is smooth and clean. He examines his face in the mirror, turning left and right, satisfied with the shave. A tiny bit of water drips from his chin. The disposable razor goes back into the toiletries basket. The can of shaving cream gets recapped.

### Scene 110: Applying Deodorant and Cologne
**Time:** 6:17 PM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago applies the deodorant stick under both arms, lifting each arm in turn. Then he picks up the small bottle of men's cologne — dark blue glass with a silver cap — and sprays it once on each side of his neck and once on his wrist. He rubs his wrists together. The cologne mixes with the clean soap smell. He is getting ready for tonight's DJ gig and wants to smell good. He checks his reflection one final time — clean-shaven, fresh, silver chain necklace in place. He begins to repack the toiletries basket.

### Scene 111: Getting Dressed — Casual for Now
**Time:** 6:20 PM
**Setting:** Shared bathroom
**Description:** Santiago pulls on the gray jogger pants and the white t-shirt he brought — casual comfort for the next few hours before changing into his DJ outfit. The towel goes back on the hook. His feet are bare on the rubber bathmat. He gathers the toiletries basket and the blue towel, tucking the small shoulder towel into the basket. He checks his phone — it is 6:20 PM. The DJ gig at the bar starts at 10 PM, so he has time for dinner and DJ practice first. He exits the bathroom, flicking off the fluorescent light.

---

## PART 10: EVENING — DINNER AND RELAXATION (6:25 PM - 7:30 PM)

### Scene 112: Back in Room — Casual
**Time:** 6:25 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room
**Description:** Santiago returns to his room in gray jogger pants and a white t-shirt, bare feet on the gray tile. He tosses the blue towel over the back of the plastic chair and sets the toiletries basket by the closet. The room is dimmer now — the evening light through the curtains is fading to deep gold and purple. He turns on the overhead light — a single bare bulb in a ceiling socket. He slides his feet into the black slides by the bed. The DJ controller on the folding table catches the light, its pads and knobs waiting.

### Scene 113: Heading to Kitchen — Dinner
**Time:** 6:28 PM
**Setting:** Shared house hallway, heading to kitchen
**Description:** Santiago walks down the narrow hallway in his casual outfit — gray joggers, white t-shirt, black slides. He passes a housemate's open door and exchanges a brief greeting — "Quiubo, parce" (What's up, bro) — the housemate, a young man about Santiago's age, waves from his bed where he watches something on his phone. The hallway leads to the small shared kitchen at the back of the house. The smell of cooking fills the hall — someone is already making dinner. The overhead bulb lights the corridor.

### Scene 114: Making Dinner — Eggs and Rice
**Time:** 6:32 PM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen
**Description:** Santiago stands at the two-burner gas stove in the small shared kitchen, a pan heating on one burner with a thin layer of oil. He cracks two eggs into the pan — they sizzle immediately, the whites turning opaque. On the other burner, a small pot of leftover rice from the communal rice cooker heats with a lid on. He holds a spatula in one hand and his phone in the other, watching a DJ tutorial on YouTube while the eggs cook. The small refrigerator hums behind him. A few dishes are stacked in the chrome sink. The bare-bulb overhead light illuminates the compact space.

### Scene 115: Plating Dinner
**Time:** 6:38 PM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Santiago slides two fried eggs from the pan onto a plate already loaded with a mound of reheated white rice. He adds a drizzle of ají from a small bottle in the fridge — the homemade hot sauce adds bright orange color and heat. He sets the pan in the sink. A glass of water from the kitchen tap sits beside the plate. The simple meal is typical for young working Colombians — quick, filling, cheap. He carries the plate to the small counter area — there is no dining table, just a narrow counter against the wall with two stools.

### Scene 116: Eating Dinner — Watching DJ Tutorial
**Time:** 6:42 PM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen, at counter
**Description:** Santiago sits on a stool at the narrow kitchen counter, eating his rice and eggs with a fork in his right hand while his phone is propped against the wall playing a DJ tutorial video. The video shows a DJ's hands moving across a controller, explaining beatmatching technique in Spanish. Santiago watches intently, chewing slowly, pausing the fork to observe a tricky transition. The plate is slowly clearing — the rice and egg yolk mixing together on the plate. The glass of water is half empty. The kitchen window above the sink shows a dark blue evening sky.

### Scene 117: Washing Dishes
**Time:** 6:52 PM
**Setting:** Shared house small kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Santiago stands at the chrome sink, washing his plate, fork, and the frying pan under running water with a sponge and dish soap. The suds are white and bubbly. He rinses each item and sets them on the small dish rack to dry. The pot of rice goes back in the fridge with a plate over it as a lid. He wipes down the counter with a damp cloth — keeping the shared kitchen clean is an unwritten house rule. The phone in his jogger pocket buzzes — a WhatsApp message from his DJ friend Carlos confirming tonight's gig details.

### Scene 118: WhatsApp Conversation — Gig Details
**Time:** 6:55 PM
**Setting:** Shared house hallway, walking back to room
**Description:** Santiago walks down the hallway toward his room, reading Carlos's WhatsApp messages. The chat shows: "Hermano we play 10 PM to midnight. Bar El Sótano, Chapinero. Bring your controller and laptop. I have the speakers. Get there by 9:30 to set up." Santiago types back: "Listo parce, nos vemos allá" (Ready bro, see you there). He adds a DJ emoji and a fire emoji. He pushes open his bedroom door, the excitement for tonight's gig building. His dark brown eyes are bright with anticipation.

---

## PART 11: DJ PRACTICE SESSION (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM)

### Scene 119: Setting Up DJ Equipment
**Time:** 7:00 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago sits in the plastic chair at the folding table, opening the sticker-covered silver laptop. The screen illuminates with the login screen. He types his password and the desktop appears — a wallpaper of a famous DJ performing at a festival. He opens the DJ software — Virtual DJ — the interface filling the screen with two virtual turntables, waveforms, and a crossfader. He connects the DJ controller via a USB cable — the controller's pads light up in a rainbow of colors: red, blue, green, purple, orange. The over-ear headphones with blue accents sit beside the controller, ready.

### Scene 120: Putting On Headphones
**Time:** 7:03 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago places the over-ear headphones over his ears, the black headband settling on top of his short dark hair. The ear cups — black with blue accent lines — cover his ears fully. He adjusts them slightly for comfort. The thin cable connects from the headphones to the DJ controller. He loads a reggaeton track into the left virtual turntable on the laptop screen — the waveform appears, green and jagged. He presses play on the controller — the music starts, audible only through the headphones, keeping the room quiet for his housemates.

### Scene 121: Loading Tracks
**Time:** 7:06 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table, close-up on laptop
**Description:** The laptop screen shows the Virtual DJ software interface. Santiago's brown hand drags a track from his music library into the right virtual turntable — the track title is visible in the software. His music library is organized into folders: "Reggaeton," "Guaracha," "Electronic," "Dembow," "Crossover." The waveforms of two tracks display side by side — one green, one blue. The BPM (beats per minute) counters show on each deck. Santiago scrolls through his library, selecting songs for tonight's set at the bar.

### Scene 122: Beatmatching Practice
**Time:** 7:10 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago works the DJ controller with both hands, eyes fixed on the laptop screen. His right hand adjusts the jog wheel — a round dial on the controller — nudging the second track's tempo to match the first. His left hand rests on the crossfader — a horizontal slider in the center of the controller. The two waveforms on the screen align as he matches the beats. He nods his head to the rhythm, feeling the sync through the headphones. The controller's colored pads glow steadily — red and blue. His silver chain necklace hangs over his white t-shirt as he leans forward in concentration.

### Scene 123: Crossfading Between Tracks
**Time:** 7:15 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago slides the crossfader slowly from left to right on the DJ controller, blending one track into the next. The laptop screen shows the two waveforms overlapping as the transition happens — the outgoing track fading, the incoming track rising. His headphones play the seamless mix. He smiles slightly — a clean transition. His fingers hover over the effects knobs on the controller, ready to add a filter or echo. The room is quiet except for the faint bleed of bass from the headphones. The overhead bare bulb light casts a warm glow. The electric fan turns slowly on the floor.

### Scene 124: Adding Effects — Echo and Filter
**Time:** 7:20 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago twists a knob on the DJ controller, adding a high-pass filter to the current track — the bass drops out, leaving only the high frequencies. Then he presses a blue pad, triggering an echo effect. The laptop screen shows the effect parameters changing in real-time. He builds the tension, then releases the filter — the bass drops back in, the full track booming through the headphones. He nods his head vigorously, feeling the drop. His technique is improving — weeks of YouTube tutorials and practice paying off. The controller LEDs pulse with the beat.

### Scene 125: Recording a Practice Mix
**Time:** 7:28 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago clicks the "record" button on the laptop DJ software — a red circle appears on screen, indicating recording is active. He begins a practice mix, transitioning through several tracks he plans to play tonight. His hands move between the jog wheels, crossfader, effects knobs, and volume sliders on the controller. The headphones sit snugly on his ears. The practice mix will be saved as an audio file that he can listen back to and critique. The laptop screen timer ticks upward — 00:00, 01:15, 02:30. His expression is focused, completely absorbed in the music.

### Scene 126: Replaying and Critiquing
**Time:** 7:45 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago stops the recording and plays it back through the headphones, listening critically. He scrubs through the timeline on the laptop, finding a transition he did not like — a slight beat mismatch around the three-minute mark. He rewinds and listens again, noting the error. He makes a mental note to adjust the timing there. His phone lies on the table beside the controller, screen showing WhatsApp messages from Carlos: "Que tracks vas a tocar?" (What tracks are you going to play?). Santiago picks up the phone to reply with a list of track names.

### Scene 127: Practicing the Set List
**Time:** 7:55 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago runs through the set list for tonight's gig — a sequence of twelve tracks progressing from chill reggaeton to high-energy guaracha. He practices each transition, refining the blends. The laptop screen shows tracks queued in order. His hands are more confident now, the movements becoming muscle memory. The controller pads flash as he triggers hot cues — markers within tracks that jump to specific moments. The room outside the headphones is silent. The beige curtains are dark now — night has fallen outside the window. The overhead bulb is the only light besides the laptop screen and controller LEDs.

### Scene 128: Taking a Break — Stretching
**Time:** 8:15 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, standing
**Description:** Santiago removes the headphones, draping them around his neck, and stands up from the plastic chair. He stretches his arms overhead, arching his back, then rolls his wrists and flexes his fingers — they have been gripping the controller for over an hour. He picks up his phone from the table and checks the time — 8:15 PM. Still an hour and fifteen minutes before he needs to leave for the bar. He takes a sip of water from a plastic bottle on the crate nightstand. The DJ controller's LEDs continue to glow softly on the folding table, the laptop screen showing the paused software.

### Scene 129: Watching DJ Performance Video
**Time:** 8:20 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, sitting on bed
**Description:** Santiago sits on the bed, back against the wall, watching a DJ performance video on his phone. The video shows a famous Colombian DJ performing at a festival — huge crowd, colorful stage lights, massive speakers. Santiago studies the DJ's movements, energy, and crowd interaction. He takes mental notes. His headphones hang around his neck, the blue accents catching the overhead light. The phone screen reflects in his dark brown eyes. The flat pillow is propped behind him. The dark blue comforter is bunched to one side. He dreams of performing at a big stage someday.

### Scene 130: Choosing DJ Outfit
**Time:** 8:35 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at closet
**Description:** Santiago stands at the open wooden closet, pulling out his DJ outfit. He selects the black slim-fit jeans, a black graphic tee with an electronic music logo — a white geometric design on the front — and his black canvas sneakers. He lays them on the bed. From the top of the closet, he takes down a small black crossbody bag — just big enough for his phone, wallet, and keys. He checks himself in the small mirror on the inside of the closet door, running a hand through his short dark hair, adjusting the fade's clean lines. The silver chain necklace is already around his neck.

### Scene 131: Getting Dressed for the Gig
**Time:** 8:40 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, center of room
**Description:** Santiago pulls on the black slim-fit jeans, swapping the gray jogger pants. He pulls the black graphic tee over his head — the white electronic music logo stretches across his chest. He tucks the front of the shirt slightly into the jeans. The silver chain necklace sits on top of the black tee. He laces up the black canvas sneakers, sitting on the bed. The small crossbody bag goes over one shoulder. He stands and checks the closet mirror again — the DJ outfit looks sharp. Clean-shaven, fresh cologne, styled hair. He looks like a DJ ready to perform.

### Scene 132: Packing DJ Equipment
**Time:** 8:45 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago carefully disconnects the DJ controller from the laptop, coiling the USB cable neatly. He places the DJ controller into a padded soft case — a black nylon bag with a zipper, slightly worn at the corners. The sticker-covered laptop goes into a laptop sleeve and then into a black backpack — different from the Rappi backpack, this one is for his music gear. The over-ear headphones go around his neck. He double-checks the bag — controller, laptop, USB cable, headphone adapter, a few extra audio cables. Everything he needs for the gig.

### Scene 133: Charging Phone — Quick Top-Up
**Time:** 8:50 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at crate nightstand
**Description:** Santiago plugs his phone into the charger cable on the crate nightstand for a quick top-up before heading out. The battery icon on the screen shows 42 percent — he needs more for the night. He sets the phone down and sits on the bed, bouncing his knee with nervous energy. Tonight's gig is small — a bar in Chapinero — but every gig matters. It is a chance to be heard, to build a reputation. He stares at the reggaeton concert poster on the wall for a moment, imagining himself on that stage. The phone screen shows the charging animation.

### Scene 134: Last Mirror Check
**Time:** 8:55 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at closet mirror
**Description:** Santiago stands at the closet mirror one last time. Black slim-fit jeans, black graphic tee with white logo, silver chain necklace, black canvas sneakers, clean-shaven jaw. He adjusts the chain so it sits centered. He runs a hand through his short dark hair one more time — the fade is clean, the top is styled forward. The headphones hang around his neck, the blue accents matching his overall dark aesthetic. The black crossbody bag holds his phone, wallet, and keys. He nods at his reflection — ready.

### Scene 135: Unplugging Phone — Heading Out
**Time:** 9:00 PM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, near door
**Description:** Santiago unplugs the phone from the charger — 58 percent now, enough for the night. He tucks it into the crossbody bag. He picks up the black backpack with the DJ equipment — controller, laptop, cables — and slings it over one shoulder. The headphones stay around his neck. He opens the bedroom door, flicks off the overhead light. The room goes dark except for the faint glow of the small digital alarm clock on the crate nightstand and the electric fan's indicator light. The motorcycle helmet comes off the wall hook. He is taking the motorcycle to Chapinero.

### Scene 136: Heading Out for the Gig
**Time:** 9:02 PM
**Setting:** Shared house hallway, heading to front door
**Description:** Santiago walks through the narrow hallway with the DJ equipment backpack, motorcycle helmet under his arm, and headphones around his neck. A housemate's door is open — the guy waves and says "Suerte, parce" (Good luck, bro). Santiago grins and fist-bumps him through the doorway. He reaches the front door, puts on his black ankle boots from the shoe tray, and opens the heavy dark green security door. The Kennedy neighborhood street outside is dark, lit by street lamps and the warm glow from tiendas still open for the evening.

### Scene 137: Night Ride — Starting Motorcycle
**Time:** 9:05 PM
**Setting:** Outside shared house, at motorcycle, night
**Description:** Santiago unchains the Honda CB 125 in the dark, the street lamp casting orange light on the chrome. He stores the chain under the seat. The DJ equipment backpack goes on his back — heavier than the Rappi backpack. He puts on the red and black helmet, the chin strap clicking. He straddles the motorcycle and turns the key. The headlight illuminates the dark street ahead, the beam cutting through the cool Bogotá night air. The engine rumbles to life. The dashboard gauges glow green. He pulls on his motorcycle gloves — safety even on a night ride.

### Scene 138: Night Ride Through Bogotá
**Time:** 9:15 PM
**Setting:** Major avenue, riding at night
**Description:** Santiago rides through nighttime Bogotá, the city transformed by darkness and artificial light. Neon shop signs glow in reds, blues, and greens along the avenue. Car headlights and taillights create streams of white and red. Street lamps cast pools of orange light on the wet pavement — it rained earlier. The TransMilenio stations are lit bright white, passengers waiting inside the glass-walled platforms. The cerros are invisible in the darkness, marked only by a few scattered lights from hillside houses. Santiago weaves through moderate nighttime traffic, the DJ backpack firm on his back.

### Scene 139: Arriving at Chapinero — Bar District
**Time:** 9:28 PM
**Setting:** Chapinero neighborhood, street with bars and nightlife
**Description:** Santiago turns onto a Chapinero side street alive with nightlife. Bars, small clubs, and restaurants line both sides — neon signs, chalkboard sidewalk menus, groups of people smoking outside, music spilling from open doors. The neighborhood is more bohemian than Kennedy — older buildings with character, street art on walls, a more diverse crowd. Santiago spots the bar — "El Sótano" — its entrance marked by a neon sign and a staircase leading down to a basement level. He parks the motorcycle nearby, chains it to a pole, and removes the helmet.

### Scene 140: Meeting Carlos Outside the Bar
**Time:** 9:32 PM
**Setting:** Outside Bar El Sótano, Chapinero street
**Description:** Santiago's friend Carlos stands outside the bar entrance, smoking and scrolling his phone. Carlos is about 22, stocky build, wearing a black cap backwards, a denim jacket, and sneakers. He grins when he sees Santiago and they do a quick handshake-to-hug greeting — the classic Colombian male greeting. "Listo, hermano?" (Ready, bro?) Carlos asks. Santiago nods, adjusting the DJ backpack on his shoulder. The bar's neon "El Sótano" sign glows blue above the staircase entrance. Music — a low thump of bass — rises from below. A bouncer with a clipboard stands at the top of the stairs.

### Scene 141: Descending to the Bar
**Time:** 9:35 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, staircase down
**Description:** Santiago and Carlos descend the narrow concrete staircase to Bar El Sótano — "The Basement." The walls of the staircase are covered in band posters, stickers, and graffiti tags. Dim purple and blue lights illuminate the steps. The bass grows louder with each step — the bar's sound system is playing background music. Santiago carries the DJ backpack carefully on the stairs, one hand on the metal railing. The air grows warmer and slightly humid as they descend. At the bottom, a small room opens up — the bar.

### Scene 142: Inside Bar El Sótano
**Time:** 9:37 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, interior
**Description:** Bar El Sótano is a small basement bar with low ceilings, exposed brick walls, and dim lighting from purple and blue LED strip lights along the ceiling edges. A bar counter with stools runs along one wall, a bartender polishing glasses behind it. Shelves of liquor bottles are backlit in warm amber. The DJ booth is in the far corner — a raised wooden platform with space for equipment, a small mixer already set up by the bar's house system, and two tall speakers on stands flanking the booth. About twenty small tables fill the space, a few already occupied by early-evening patrons. The floor is dark concrete. A small disco ball hangs from the ceiling.

### Scene 143: Setting Up DJ Equipment
**Time:** 9:40 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago and Carlos set up their equipment in the DJ booth. Santiago unzips the padded case and places his DJ controller on the wooden table, connecting it to his laptop via the USB cable. Carlos plugs audio cables from the controller into the bar's mixer, which connects to the two tall speakers. Santiago opens the laptop — the Virtual DJ software loads, the two virtual turntables appearing on screen. He puts on the over-ear headphones, one ear cup on, one off — the classic DJ monitoring position. The controller pads light up in colors. Carlos tests the speaker connection with a quick burst of sound.

### Scene 144: Sound Check
**Time:** 9:48 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago plays a test track through the speakers at low volume — a reggaeton beat fills the small bar. He adjusts the equalizer on the mixer, tweaking the bass and treble until the sound is balanced for the room's acoustics. Carlos stands near one of the tall speakers, giving a thumbs up when the bass sounds right. The bartender nods approvingly from behind the bar. A few early patrons look up from their drinks. Santiago stops the test track, satisfied with the sound. The laptop screen shows the prepared set list — twelve tracks in order. The disco ball begins to rotate slowly, casting moving dots of light.

### Scene 145: Pre-Gig Nerves — Deep Breath
**Time:** 9:55 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago stands behind the DJ controller, hands flat on the wooden table surface, taking a deep breath. The bar is filling up — more people descending the staircase, finding tables, ordering drinks at the bar. The ambient music plays at low volume. In five minutes he starts his set. His heart beats fast. He adjusts the headphones around his neck, checks the set list on the laptop one more time, and cracks his knuckles. Carlos claps him on the shoulder — "Dale, parce, vas a romperla" (Go for it, bro, you're going to kill it). Santiago exhales and nods. The purple and blue lights cast shadows on his focused face.

### Scene 146: First Track — The Set Begins
**Time:** 10:00 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago presses play on the DJ controller and the first track of his set fills Bar El Sótano through the speakers — a smooth reggaeton intro with a building synth line. The bass vibrates through the floor. He has one headphone ear cup pressed to his left ear, the other ear open to hear the room sound. His right hand rests on the jog wheel, his left on the crossfader. The bar is about half full now — people at tables, standing at the bar, a few heads already nodding to the beat. The purple and blue LED lights pulse softly. The disco ball scatters light dots across the brick walls. Santiago's expression shifts from nervous to focused.

### Scene 147: Building the Energy — Second Track
**Time:** 10:08 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago transitions smoothly into the second track — the energy kicks up a notch, the BPM slightly faster, the bassline harder. He slides the crossfader, the blend clean and seamless. A few people near the small open area in front of the DJ booth start to move — bobbing heads, tapping feet, one couple swaying together. Santiago feeds off the crowd's reaction, a slight smile crossing his face. The controller pads flash blue and green as he triggers a filter effect. The laptop waveforms move in sync. Carlos stands to the side of the booth, nodding approval and filming a short video on his phone.

### Scene 148: Crowd Dancing — Mid-Set
**Time:** 10:30 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth and dance floor
**Description:** The small bar is packed now, the dance floor crowded with about thirty people moving to the music. Santiago has built the energy through four tracks, each one raising the tempo and intensity. He stands at the controller, headphones on one ear, body moving with the beat. His hands work the controller expertly — adjusting volume, triggering effects, cueing the next track. The purple and blue lights strobe slowly. The disco ball spins faster, scattering light. Faces in the crowd glow in the colored light. Carlos dances near the booth, drink in hand. The air is warm and electric with music and movement.

### Scene 149: Big Drop — Crowd Reaction
**Time:** 10:45 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago builds a tension sequence — cutting the bass, adding a rising filter, the crowd's anticipation growing as the music thins to just hi-hats and a vocal sample. He raises one hand from the controller, palm up, the crowd following the gesture — then drops it, slamming the crossfader and bringing the bass back in with a massive guaracha drop. The crowd erupts — cheers, hands in the air, the dance floor jumping. Santiago grins wide, caught in the moment, his dark brown eyes alive with excitement. The speakers thump, the walls vibrate, the disco ball spins. This is why he works deliveries all day — for moments like this.

### Scene 150: Transitioning to Calmer Track
**Time:** 11:00 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago brings the energy down after the peak, transitioning into a smoother, slower reggaeton track — giving the crowd a chance to breathe. His crossfade is gradual, the outgoing track's bass fading as the incoming track's melody rises. A few dancers leave the floor for their tables, reaching for drinks. Others stay, swaying to the mellower beat. Santiago takes a sip from a water bottle that Carlos placed on the edge of the DJ booth. His face glistens slightly under the colored lights — the basement bar is warm. He loads the next track, keeping the momentum flowing smoothly.

### Scene 151: Reading the Crowd
**Time:** 11:05 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago scans the crowd from behind the DJ controller, headphones half-on, gauging the energy. He reads body language — a group near the bar is chatting, the dance floor crowd wants more energy, a couple requests something from the edge of the booth. He nods, selecting a popular track from his library on the laptop, dragging it to the next deck. Reading the crowd is a skill he is learning — knowing when to push the energy and when to pull back. The purple lights cast his face in shadow. His dark brown eyes scan left to right across the room.

### Scene 152: Building Energy Again — Guaracha Set
**Time:** 11:12 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago launches into a guaracha sequence — fast, tribal-influenced electronic music that is popular in Colombian clubs. The BPM jumps up, the tribal drums and synth stabs filling the bar. The dance floor explodes back to life — people moving fast, feet stamping, hands clapping. Santiago works the controller with intensity, his fingers moving rapidly between the jog wheels and the effects pads. He triggers a siren sound effect from a blue pad — the crowd responds with cheers. His body bounces with the beat. The disco ball spins fast, scattering wild patterns of light across the dancers.

### Scene 153: Carlos Filming from the Crowd
**Time:** 11:20 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, dance floor view of DJ booth
**Description:** Carlos stands in the crowd, phone held up vertically, filming Santiago at the DJ booth. The phone screen shows Santiago in the colored lights — hands on the controller, headphones on one ear, the laptop screen glowing behind him. The crowd dances in the foreground of the video. Carlos pans the camera from the crowd to the DJ booth, capturing the energy. He uploads a short clip to Instagram Stories with a fire emoji and the tag for Bar El Sótano. Santiago is unaware of the camera, fully absorbed in the music and the controller.

### Scene 154: Mixing a Surprise Track
**Time:** 11:28 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago surprises the crowd by mixing in a classic Colombian salsa sample over the electronic beat — the horn section and piano riff from a well-known song. The crowd recognizes it instantly — cheers, singing along, a few hands raised. Santiago grins, proud of the creative mix. He adjusts the EQ, letting the salsa sample sit on top of the guaracha beat for eight bars before filtering it out smoothly. The blend of traditional and modern is what makes his sets unique. The bartender behind the counter nods approvingly, wiping glasses.

### Scene 155: Last Track — Closing the Set
**Time:** 11:45 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago announces his last track through a quick fade-down and fade-up — a signal to the crowd. The final track is a big reggaeton anthem, one everyone knows. The crowd sings along, the bar unified in the music. Santiago plays it straight, no tricks, letting the song speak for itself. He removes the headphones from his ear and drapes them around his neck, smiling broadly as the crowd enjoys the finale. The purple and blue lights pulse with the beat. The laptop screen shows the track's waveform nearing its end. Two hours have flown by.

### Scene 156: Set Complete — Crowd Applause
**Time:** 11:55 PM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** The last track fades out and Santiago raises both hands — a thank you to the crowd. Applause and cheers fill the small bar. A few people near the booth clap him on the shoulder. Santiago is breathing hard, his face shiny under the lights, a huge grin on his face. Carlos runs up and hugs him — "Lo hiciste, hermano!" (You did it, bro!). The ambient music kicks back in from the bar's playlist, the energy winding down. Santiago stands at the booth, soaking in the moment, the DJ controller still warm from his hands.

### Scene 157: Packing Up Equipment
**Time:** 12:00 AM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, DJ booth
**Description:** Santiago carefully disconnects the DJ controller from the laptop and the mixer, coiling cables neatly. He places the controller back in its padded soft case, zipping it shut. The laptop goes into its sleeve and then the black backpack. Audio cables get wound and tucked into a side pocket. The headphones go around his neck. Carlos unplugs the connection to the house speakers. The bar is still open, patrons chatting at tables, but the dance floor has cleared. The purple lights dim to a softer glow. The disco ball slows to a lazy rotation.

### Scene 158: Thanking the Bar Owner
**Time:** 12:05 AM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, at bar counter
**Description:** Santiago approaches the bar counter where the bar owner — a bearded man in his 40s in a black t-shirt — hands him a folded envelope. Inside is the payment for the gig in cash — Colombian pesos. Santiago counts it discreetly, nods, and shakes the owner's hand. "Bien, hermano, la gente lo disfrutó" (Good, bro, people enjoyed it), the owner says. Santiago thanks him and asks about future gigs. The owner says he will call next week. It is a small victory — one gig leads to another. A water glass sits on the bar in front of Santiago.

### Scene 159: Quick Water at the Bar
**Time:** 12:08 AM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, at bar counter
**Description:** Santiago sits on a bar stool, drinking a tall glass of cold water. The ice clinks against the glass. His face is still flushed from the two-hour set, his black graphic tee slightly damp at the collar. The headphones hang around his neck. The DJ backpack sits at his feet. The bar has thinned out — a few lingering groups, the bartender washing glasses. The ambient music plays softly. Carlos sits beside him, talking excitedly about the set's high points. Santiago listens, hydrating, the adrenaline slowly fading. The bar's brick walls and dim lights feel intimate and comfortable.

### Scene 160: Leaving the Bar
**Time:** 12:15 AM
**Setting:** Bar El Sótano, staircase up
**Description:** Santiago climbs the narrow staircase out of Bar El Sótano, DJ backpack on one shoulder, helmet in the other hand. Carlos follows behind. The staircase walls with their band posters and stickers pass by. At the top, the cool Bogotá night air hits them — a relief after the warm basement. The Chapinero street is quieter now but still lit with neon signs. A few people walk on the sidewalk. Santiago takes a deep breath of the mountain-cooled air. The "El Sótano" neon sign glows blue above the staircase entrance.

### Scene 161: Saying Goodbye to Carlos
**Time:** 12:18 AM
**Setting:** Chapinero street, outside bar
**Description:** Santiago and Carlos stand on the sidewalk outside the bar. They do the Colombian handshake-hug goodbye. "Buena, parce, estuvo duro" (Nice, bro, it was fire), Carlos says. Santiago grins — "Nos vemos, hermano" (See you, bro). Carlos heads off toward the TransMilenio station for the bus home. Santiago walks to his chained motorcycle a few meters down the street. The Chapinero nightlife continues — people exiting other bars, a taxi waiting at the curb, the faint thump of music from other basements. The cool night air carries the smell of arepas from a late-night stand.

### Scene 162: Night Ride Home
**Time:** 12:22 AM
**Setting:** Bogotá street, riding at night
**Description:** Santiago rides the Honda CB 125 through the late-night Bogotá streets, the DJ backpack secure on his back. The city is quieter now — fewer cars, mostly taxis and a few late-night buses. The street lamps cast orange pools of light on the empty avenues. Traffic lights cycle through green-yellow-red with almost no traffic to direct. The motorcycle headlight illuminates the road ahead. The cool air flows past his helmet. He rides steadily, not too fast — the roads are less predictable at night, with potholes hidden in shadow. The cerros are invisible in the darkness but he knows they are there, the eastern wall of the city.

### Scene 163: Passing a Late-Night Arepa Stand
**Time:** 12:30 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood, street corner at night
**Description:** Santiago spots a late-night arepa stand on a Kennedy street corner — a metal cart with a flat griddle, smoke rising, a bare bulb illuminating the vendor. The smell of grilling corn dough is irresistible. He pulls the motorcycle over, flips the visor up, and orders an arepa de queso — a hot corn cake stuffed with melted white cheese. The vendor, an older woman in an apron and wool hat against the Bogotá cold, presses the arepa flat on the griddle. Santiago leans against the motorcycle, the cheese oozing as he takes the first bite. The hot arepa warms his gloved hands.

### Scene 164: Finishing the Arepa
**Time:** 12:34 AM
**Setting:** Kennedy street corner, at motorcycle, night
**Description:** Santiago finishes the arepa, licking melted cheese from his fingers. He crumples the paper wrapper and drops it in a trash bin by the stand. He pays the vendor with a coin from his jeans pocket. "Gracias, señora," he says. She nods and smiles, turning back to the griddle where another arepa sizzles. The Kennedy street is dark and quiet — most houses have their lights off, the metal security doors shut. A stray dog trots past under a street lamp. Santiago puts his gloves back on, mounts the motorcycle, and rides the last few blocks home.

### Scene 165: Arriving Home — Parking Motorcycle
**Time:** 12:38 AM
**Setting:** Outside shared house, at motorcycle, night
**Description:** Santiago parks the Honda CB 125 in its spot, the motorcycle headlight briefly illuminating the dark green security door before he kills the engine. The street is silent except for a distant dog barking. He removes the helmet, his hair damp with sweat from the warm helmet. He chains the motorcycle to the metal post — the familiar click of the lock. He gathers the DJ backpack and helmet, fishing for the house key in his crossbody bag. The street lamp above casts a dim orange circle. His breath makes a faint mist in the cool Bogotá highland night air.

## PART 12: LATE NIGHT — RETURN HOME AND WIND DOWN (12:40 AM - 1:00 AM)

### Scene 166: Entering the Dark House
**Time:** 12:40 AM
**Setting:** Shared house hallway, night
**Description:** Santiago opens the heavy dark green security door as quietly as possible, stepping into the hallway. The house is dark and silent — his housemates are asleep. He closes the door softly, turning the deadbolts gently. He carries the motorcycle helmet and DJ backpack, walking in socked feet after leaving his boots in the shoe tray. He navigates the dark hallway by memory, the gray tile cool under his feet. A thin line of light shows under one housemate's door — still awake, watching something on a phone with earbuds. Santiago moves past silently toward his room.

### Scene 167: Entering His Room — Post-Gig
**Time:** 12:42 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, night
**Description:** Santiago pushes open his bedroom door and enters the dark room. He sets the DJ backpack on the floor beside the folding table and hangs the motorcycle helmet on the wall hook. The small electric fan is still on from earlier, turning slowly. He turns on the overhead light — the bare bulb harsh after the dark. The room is as he left it — bed unmade, the small digital alarm clock on the crate nightstand reading 12:42. The thin beige curtains are dark against the night outside. He exhales long and deep — the adrenaline from the gig is still fading.

### Scene 168: Putting Away DJ Equipment
**Time:** 12:44 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago unzips the DJ backpack and carefully removes the padded controller case and the laptop sleeve. He places the DJ controller back on the folding table in its usual spot — pads facing up, cables coiled beside it. The sticker-covered laptop goes beside it, closed. The over-ear headphones with blue accents he drapes over the laptop. The audio cables go into a small pile beside the controller. He treats his equipment with care — it is expensive and hard-won, bought with months of delivery earnings. The controller's pads are dark now, unplugged, waiting for the next session.

### Scene 169: Changing into Sleep Clothes
**Time:** 12:47 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, center of room
**Description:** Santiago pulls off the black graphic tee and tosses it toward the closet area — it lands on the floor, a problem for tomorrow. He takes off the black slim-fit jeans, stepping out of them. The silver chain necklace comes off and he sets it on the crate nightstand beside the phone. He pulls on the familiar black athletic shorts and the loose gray t-shirt — his sleep clothes. The crossbody bag goes on the floor by the closet. The black canvas sneakers get kicked to the foot of the bed. The overhead bulb light is too bright for the late hour — he squints.

### Scene 170: Plugging In Phone
**Time:** 12:49 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at crate nightstand
**Description:** Santiago sits on the edge of the bed and plugs the smartphone into the charger cable on the crate nightstand. The phone screen lights up — 23 percent battery, new WhatsApp notifications from Carlos: photos and a video clip from tonight's set. Santiago opens the video — it shows him at the DJ booth, the crowd dancing, the colored lights. He watches it twice, smiling. He saves it to his phone gallery. He taps through Instagram — Carlos has already posted a Story tagging him. A few likes and comments from people who were at the bar. He double-taps a fire emoji comment.

### Scene 171: Scrolling Social Media in Bed
**Time:** 12:52 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed
**Description:** Santiago lies in bed on his back, the dark blue comforter pulled up to his waist, scrolling through social media on the phone held above his face. The phone screen illuminates his features in white-blue light — the rest of the room is dark, the overhead bulb now off. Only the phone glow, the small digital alarm clock's red numbers, and the faint indicator light on the electric fan provide light. He watches another DJ's Instagram Reel, double-taps to like, then switches to YouTube to save a tutorial for later. His eyes grow heavy, the phone screen blurring.

### Scene 172: Setting Alarm
**Time:** 12:55 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed
**Description:** Santiago opens the alarm app on his phone, setting it for 8:00 AM — another day of deliveries tomorrow. The alarm screen shows a simple digital clock interface with the time set. He double-checks that the alarm sound is on and the volume is up. He places the phone face-down on the crate nightstand, the charger cable connected. The red numbers on the small digital alarm clock read 12:55. He pulls the dark blue comforter up to his chest and shifts onto his side, pulling the flat pillow under his head.

### Scene 173: Replaying the Night in His Mind
**Time:** 12:57 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed, dark
**Description:** Santiago lies in the dark, eyes open, staring at the dim ceiling. The electric fan hums and turns. The thin beige curtains are completely dark — no street light reaches this side. He replays the gig in his mind — the moment the bass dropped and the crowd erupted, Carlos filming, the bar owner handing him the envelope, the smooth transitions that worked, the one transition that was slightly off. He smiles in the dark. It was a good night. The Kennedy neighborhood outside is silent. A distant car passes on the avenue, its engine sound fading.

### Scene 174: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 1:00 AM
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed, dark
**Description:** Santiago's breathing deepens and slows. His body relaxes into the thin mattress, one hand resting on his chest, the other tucked under the flat pillow. The dark blue comforter rises and falls gently with each breath. The silver chain necklace lies on the crate nightstand beside the charging phone and the small digital alarm clock, its red numbers now reading 1:00. The DJ controller on the folding table is a dark silhouette across the room, its pads unlit. The motorcycle helmet hangs on its hook by the door. The orange Rappi backpack leans against the wall. The electric fan turns and hums. Santiago sleeps — tomorrow he rides again.

## SUPPLEMENTARY SCENES: ADDITIONAL DELIVERY ENCOUNTERS (Various Times)

### Scene 175: Navigating a Construction Zone
**Time:** 11:15 AM (alternate morning delivery)
**Setting:** Avenue under construction, riding
**Description:** Santiago navigates a stretch of avenue under construction — orange traffic cones narrow the road to one lane, a flagman in a reflective vest waves traffic through. A jackhammer pounds concrete nearby, the sound rattling through Santiago's helmet. The Honda CB 125 rolls slowly over rough, unpaved road surface. Piles of gravel and sand sit beside the lane. A construction crew in yellow hard hats and orange vests operates heavy machinery — a small excavator digging a trench. Orange mesh barriers line the work zone. Traffic backs up behind the construction, horns honking.

### Scene 176: Delivery in the Rain — Poncho
**Time:** 2:20 PM (alternate rainy afternoon)
**Setting:** Residential street, in heavy rain
**Description:** Santiago rides through heavy rain wearing a clear plastic poncho over his motorcycle jacket — the poncho flaps in the wind, water streaming off it. The orange Rappi backpack is visible underneath, protected. His visor has rain streaming down it, making visibility poor. He rides extra slowly, headlight on in the gray gloom. The residential street's gutters overflow with brown rainwater. Pedestrians huddle under awnings and umbrella. A woman dashes across the street with a newspaper over her head. The motorcycle tires splash through puddles on the cracked pavement.

### Scene 177: Flat Tire on Side Street
**Time:** 3:30 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Quiet side street, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago crouches beside the Honda CB 125 on a quiet side street, examining the rear tire — flat, the rubber visibly deflated against the pavement. A nail is embedded in the tread. He sighs, pulling off his gloves. He opens the phone and searches for the nearest moto taller (motorcycle repair shop). The Rappi app shows an active order — he will need to cancel or reassign it. The side street has a low brick wall with a vine growing over it, a closed metal gate, and a cat sitting on the wall watching him. His tools are limited — he needs a shop. He pushes the motorcycle toward the main road, boots scraping on the pavement.

### Scene 178: At the Motorcycle Repair Shop
**Time:** 3:45 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Small motorcycle repair shop (moto taller)
**Description:** Santiago stands in a small moto taller — a garage-like space open to the street, with motorcycle parts, tires, and tools organized on shelves and hooks along the walls. A mechanic in grease-stained blue coveralls examines the flat rear tire, the Honda CB 125 up on a small stand. Air compressors, tire irons, wrenches, and oil cans clutter the workbench. A hand-painted sign above the entrance reads "TALLER DE MOTOS" in red letters. Santiago watches as the mechanic removes the nail and patches the inner tube. Another motorcycle — partially disassembled — sits in the corner of the shop. A radio plays salsa music.

### Scene 179: Paying the Mechanic
**Time:** 4:00 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Motorcycle repair shop
**Description:** The mechanic reinstalls the patched tire and lowers the motorcycle from the stand. He pumps the tire with a hand gauge, checking the pressure. Santiago pulls peso bills from his pocket and pays the mechanic. The cost is modest — a common roadside repair. The mechanic wipes his hands on a rag and nods. Santiago tests the tire by pressing on it with his boot — firm and round. He thanks the mechanic — "Gracias, patrón" — and wheels the motorcycle out of the shop onto the street. The repair has cost him an hour of delivery time and some earnings, but the bike is rolling again.

### Scene 180: TransMilenio Encounter — Bus Splash
**Time:** 10:30 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Major avenue, riding alongside TransMilenio lane
**Description:** Santiago rides alongside the dedicated TransMilenio lane on a major avenue. A long red articulated TransMilenio bus — two segments connected by a flexible joint — barrels through a large puddle in its lane, sending a wall of brown water splashing toward Santiago. He swerves slightly, but the water hits his left side — splashing his jeans, boots, and the motorcycle jacket. He shakes his head inside the helmet, water dripping from the jacket's reflective strips. The TransMilenio bus continues without slowing, passengers visible through the windows. Santiago wipes his visor with a gloved hand and rides on.

### Scene 181: Delivery to a Street Market Area
**Time:** 11:45 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Street market area, walking with delivery
**Description:** Santiago walks through a crowded street market carrying a delivery bag — the motorcycle is parked a block away, the market streets too narrow for vehicles. Market stalls line both sides — canvas tarps and metal frames sheltering vendors selling produce (green plantains, ripe mangoes, red tomatoes, white onions, bunches of cilantro), fresh flowers in colorful buckets, and household goods. The narrow passage is crowded with shoppers carrying bags. The ground is wet with vegetable debris. Santiago navigates carefully, delivery bag held high to avoid bumping people. The market smells of ripe fruit, flowers, and raw fish from a pescadería nearby.

### Scene 182: Crossing a Busy Intersection on Foot
**Time:** 12:00 PM (alternate midday)
**Setting:** Major intersection, walking
**Description:** Santiago crosses a busy intersection on foot, carrying a large delivery bag — the order was for a building across the intersection from where he parked. He waits at the crosswalk with a group of pedestrians — office workers, a woman with a stroller, a man carrying a toolbox. The traffic light turns green for pedestrians and they cross in a group. Yellow taxis idle at the stop line. A street vendor on the median sells bottles of water and bags of chips from a small rolling cart. Santiago walks quickly, boots on the painted crosswalk lines, the orange Rappi backpack bobbing on his back.

## SUPPLEMENTARY SCENES: DJ AND MUSIC LIFE (Various Times)

### Scene 183: Watching YouTube Tutorial — Mixing Technique
**Time:** 7:30 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago sits at the folding table, the laptop open to YouTube. A DJ tutorial video plays — a close-up of hands on a DJ controller, the instructor explaining how to use the EQ knobs to create smooth transitions. Santiago mimics the movements on his own controller, pausing the video to practice, then playing it again. A notebook beside the laptop has handwritten notes — BPM ranges, transition techniques, track names. A pen sits on the notebook. The overhead bulb provides the main light, the laptop screen adding a white glow. The headphones are on his ears, one cup pushed back.

### Scene 184: Downloading New Tracks
**Time:** 8:00 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at laptop
**Description:** Santiago scrolls through a music download site on the laptop, previewing new reggaeton and guaracha tracks through his headphones. The website shows album art thumbnails, track names, BPM indicators, and download buttons. He clicks to preview a track — the waveform plays on screen, the headphones delivering the sound. He nods to a track he likes, clicking download. A folder on the desktop labeled "New Tracks - February" fills with MP3 files. The internet connection is slow — a progress bar inches across the screen for each download. The small Bluetooth speaker on the table sits unused, headphones preferred for late-night listening.

### Scene 185: Organizing Music Library
**Time:** 8:30 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at laptop
**Description:** Santiago drags and drops music files into organized folders on the laptop — sorting new downloads by genre into "Reggaeton," "Guaracha," "Electronic," "Dembow," and "Crossover." He renames files that have messy names from the download, typing the correct artist and track title. The Virtual DJ software is open in the background, its music library syncing with the new additions. He tags each track with BPM and key information. The organizational work is unglamorous but essential — finding the right track in the middle of a set depends on a clean library. The laptop screen casts blue-white light on his concentrated face.

### Scene 186: Recording a Mix for SoundCloud
**Time:** 9:00 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table
**Description:** Santiago records a 30-minute mix on the laptop, the Virtual DJ software's record function capturing every transition. He plays through a curated set of ten tracks, blending them seamlessly. The headphones are fully on both ears, the room silent except for the faint bass bleed. His hands move between the DJ controller's jog wheels, crossfader, and EQ knobs with growing confidence. The laptop screen shows the recording timer counting up — 15:00, 16:00, 17:00. When finished, he stops the recording and exports it as an MP3. He will upload it to his SoundCloud page — "DJ Santi Bogotá" — later tonight.

### Scene 187: Uploading to SoundCloud
**Time:** 9:35 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at laptop
**Description:** Santiago opens the SoundCloud website on the laptop, his profile page showing: "DJ Santi Bogotá" with a profile photo of him at a DJ booth. He has six previous mixes uploaded, with a modest number of plays and a few followers. He clicks "upload," selects the new MP3 mix file, and types a title and description. He adds genre tags: "reggaeton," "guaracha," "Colombian DJ," "Bogotá." The upload progress bar moves slowly on the slow internet connection. He adds a cover image — the screenshot from tonight's gig. While waiting, he scrolls through other DJs' profiles, listening to their mixes for inspiration.

### Scene 188: Practicing Scratching Technique
**Time:** 7:45 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at folding table, close-up on hands
**Description:** Santiago practices scratching on the DJ controller — his right hand moves the jog wheel back and forth rapidly in short, rhythmic bursts while his left hand cuts the crossfader in and out. The headphones play the result — a percussive, rhythmic scratch pattern over the playing track. His technique is rough but improving. He repeats the same pattern over and over — muscle memory building. The controller's jog wheel spins smoothly under his fingertips. His dark brown eyes focus intensely on his hands. A bead of concentration forms on his brow. The silver chain necklace sways slightly as his hands move.

### Scene 189: Listening to a New Track — Discovery
**Time:** 10:00 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, lying on bed
**Description:** Santiago lies on the bed, headphones on, eyes closed, listening to a new track he discovered on SoundCloud. The music fills his ears — a blend of Colombian folk rhythms and electronic production that he has never heard before. His foot taps the dark blue comforter to the beat. His face shows a mix of surprise and inspiration — this is the kind of fusion he wants to create in his own sets. The phone screen on the crate nightstand shows the SoundCloud app with the track's waveform playing. The overhead light is off, only the phone glow and the alarm clock's red numbers illuminating the room.

### Scene 190: Messaging a DJ Mentor
**Time:** 10:15 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, sitting on bed
**Description:** Santiago types a long WhatsApp message to an older DJ he looks up to — DJ Rafa, who runs a small DJ collective in Bogotá. The message asks about an upcoming DJ workshop and whether Santiago can attend. He also shares the link to his new SoundCloud mix, asking for feedback. The WhatsApp chat shows a history of their conversation — DJ Rafa has given Santiago tips and advice before, mentoring him informally. Santiago re-reads the message twice before sending, making sure it sounds respectful. The blue checkmarks appear — read. Three dots — Rafa is typing. Santiago waits, heart racing slightly.

## SUPPLEMENTARY SCENES: DAILY LIFE DETAILS (Various Times)

### Scene 191: Morning Phone Charge Check
**Time:** 8:02 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at crate nightstand
**Description:** Santiago picks up the phone from the crate nightstand and unplugs the charger cable. The battery icon shows 100 percent — full charge. The charger cable coils on the crate surface. He checks the Rappi app — the system is already showing available delivery zones and estimated earnings for the day. Push notifications show a "bonus zone" in the Chapinero area for the morning. He makes a mental note to head there first. The small digital alarm clock reads 8:02. The thin beige curtains glow with gray morning light.

### Scene 192: Checking Motorcycle Before Ride
**Time:** 8:52 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Outside shared house, at motorcycle
**Description:** Santiago performs a quick pre-ride check of the Honda CB 125. He squeezes the front and rear brake levers — firm, working. He checks the tire pressure by pressing on each tire with his thumb — good. He tests the headlight — flick on, flick off. He checks the mirror adjustments — left and right, both showing the street behind. He opens the seat and checks the chain and lock are stored. The fuel gauge shows three-quarters full. He wipes the mirrors with the cuff of his jacket. A neighborhood boy on a bicycle rides past, waving.

### Scene 193: Sending Money to Family — Phone Transfer
**Time:** 6:00 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, sitting on bed
**Description:** Santiago opens his banking app on the phone — a simple digital wallet popular in Colombia. He transfers a portion of his weekly earnings to his mamá Gloria's account in Soacha. The screen shows the transfer amount, the recipient name "Gloria M.", and a confirmation button. He taps "send" and the transfer completes with a green checkmark. He does this every week — part of his earnings goes to help the family. He sends his mom a WhatsApp message: "Listo, mami, ya mandé" (Done, mom, I already sent it). A heart emoji comes back almost immediately. He smiles.

### Scene 194: Hand-Washing Delivery Clothes
**Time:** 6:30 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Shared house small patio/wash area
**Description:** Santiago stands at a concrete wash basin (lavadero) on the small covered back patio of the shared house, hand-washing his work jeans and the black hoodie. He scrubs the jeans with a bar of blue laundry soap (jabón Rey), the basin filling with sudsy water. The patio is a small tiled area with a clothesline strung between two posts, a few other housemates' clothes already drying. A plastic bucket sits beside the basin with more dirty clothes waiting. The patio looks onto a narrow backyard with a concrete wall and a neighbor's house beyond. Santiago wrings out the jeans and hangs them on the line with plastic clothespins.

### Scene 195: Hanging Laundry to Dry
**Time:** 6:40 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Shared house small patio, at clothesline
**Description:** Santiago clips the washed black hoodie to the clothesline with two plastic clothespins. The jeans already hang beside it, dripping slightly onto the tile patio. He adds a couple of t-shirts and socks to the line. The clothesline stretches from a metal hook on the house wall to a concrete post, sagging slightly under the weight. The evening sky above the patio is gray-blue, the first stars not yet visible. The patio light — a bulb in a plastic fixture — casts yellow light. A potted plant in a cracked clay pot sits in the corner. The wash basin drains slowly.

### Scene 196: Cleaning His Room
**Time:** 5:00 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room
**Description:** Santiago sweeps the gray tile floor of his room with a short broom, pushing dust and small debris toward the door. He straightens the dark blue comforter on the bed, pulling it flat. The closet door gets pushed closed. He picks up a few t-shirts from the floor and hangs them on wire hangers. The DJ controller and laptop are carefully wiped with a cloth. He picks up the empty water bottle from the crate nightstand and the crumpled bread wrapper from breakfast. The room looks noticeably better — small and simple but tidy. The thin beige curtains let in late afternoon light.

### Scene 197: Sunday Visit — Riding to Soacha
**Time:** 10:00 AM (Sunday)
**Setting:** Highway south of Bogotá, riding toward Soacha
**Description:** Santiago rides the Honda CB 125 south on the highway toward Soacha, where his family lives. The road is a wide two-lane highway with moderate Sunday traffic — cars, buses, trucks. The landscape changes from urban Bogotá to the peri-urban sprawl of Soacha — clusters of apartment towers and working-class neighborhoods spreading across flat terrain. The green cerros still rise to the east. Santiago carries a plastic bag tied to the motorcycle rack — fruit he bought at the market for his family. He wears casual clothes — no Rappi backpack today. His helmet visor is up, enjoying the cool morning air. A road sign reads "Soacha" with a distance marker.

### Scene 198: Arriving at Family Home in Soacha
**Time:** 10:30 AM (Sunday)
**Setting:** Santiago's family home, Soacha, at front door
**Description:** Santiago parks the motorcycle on the narrow street outside a modest house in Soacha — a single-story brick house with a corrugated metal roof, painted green with white trim. A small front porch has two plastic chairs and a potted geranium. The metal front door is open, the inner wooden door visible. His mamá Gloria — a woman in her early 40s with dark hair in a bun, wearing a floral apron — appears at the door, smiling wide. Santiago removes his helmet, grinning, and walks up to give her a kiss on the cheek. He holds up the bag of fruit. "Traje fruta, mami" (I brought fruit, mom).

### Scene 199: Family Lunch in Soacha
**Time:** 12:30 PM (Sunday)
**Setting:** Family home kitchen, Soacha
**Description:** Santiago sits at the family dining table with his mamá Gloria, papá Hernán — a weathered man in his mid-40s in a polo shirt — and his younger sister Camila, 15, in a t-shirt and jeans with her dark hair in a ponytail. The table is set with a homemade lunch — a large pot of sancocho (hearty chicken and vegetable soup) in the center, plates of white rice, sliced avocado, and a pitcher of limonada (lemonade). Santiago ladles sancocho into his bowl — chunks of chicken, potato, yuca, corn on the cob, and plantain in a rich broth. The family talks and laughs, catching up on the week. The kitchen has warm-colored walls and a window with a view of the neighbor's roof.

### Scene 200: Playing with Sister's Phone
**Time:** 1:30 PM (Sunday)
**Setting:** Family home living room, Soacha
**Description:** Santiago and Camila sit on a worn couch in the small living room, both looking at Camila's phone. She shows him a TikTok dance she learned, and he laughs. He shows her the video from his DJ gig — she watches with wide eyes and says he looks cool. The living room has a small TV on a wooden stand, a religious image (Virgen del Carmen) on the wall, a bookshelf with school textbooks and framed family photos, and curtains with a floral pattern. Mamá Gloria brings them each a glass of limonada. Papá Hernán watches a soccer match on the TV, the volume low.

## SUPPLEMENTARY SCENES: ADDITIONAL BEDROOM AND BATHROOM (Various Times)

### Scene 201: Late Night Snack — Crackers in Bed
**Time:** 11:30 PM (alternate late night)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed
**Description:** Santiago sits in bed, back against the wall, eating crackers from an open package. Crumbs fall on the dark blue comforter. A glass of water from the kitchen sits on the crate nightstand. He scrolls through music forums on his phone, reading about upcoming tracks and DJ equipment. The overhead light is off — only the phone screen illuminates the room. The cracker package (galletas de soda) is a cheap Colombian brand, the plastic wrapping rustling as he pulls out another one. The DJ controller across the room is a dark shape. The electric fan turns, pushing cool air.

### Scene 202: Alarm Snooze — Five More Minutes
**Time:** 8:00 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, in bed
**Description:** The smartphone alarm blares on the crate nightstand. Santiago's hand emerges from under the dark blue comforter, fumbling for the phone. He finds it, squints at the bright screen, and taps "snooze" — five more minutes. He retracts his hand under the comforter, pulling it over his head. The thin beige curtains show gray morning light. The small digital alarm clock confirms it is 8:00 AM. The motorcycle helmet hangs patiently on the wall hook. The Rappi backpack leans against the wall, waiting. The room is quiet except for the electric fan and the distant sound of traffic outside.

### Scene 203: Making the Bed — Quick Version
**Time:** 8:35 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Santiago's rented room, at bed
**Description:** Santiago pulls the dark blue comforter roughly flat across the single bed — a quick, young-man version of making the bed. The flat pillow gets tossed to the head of the bed. It is not neat, but it is off the floor. He picks up the gray t-shirt from the bed and tosses it into the closet. The room looks passable. He grabs his phone from the crate nightstand and tucks it in his pocket. The motorcycle jacket waits on its nail by the door. Today is another delivery day.

### Scene 204: Morning Bathroom — Splashing Face
**Time:** 8:11 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Santiago stands at the bathroom sink, cupping cold water from the chrome faucet and splashing it on his face. The water shocks him awake — he gasps slightly, then splashes again. Water drips from his chin and jawline into the white porcelain basin. He grabs the blue towel from the hook and pats his face dry. His eyes are more alert now, his dark brown irises visible in the rectangular mirror. The fluorescent tube light buzzes overhead. No time for a shower this morning — he overslept and needs to start deliveries quickly.

### Scene 205: Quick Deodorant — No Shower Morning
**Time:** 8:13 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at shelf
**Description:** Santiago grabs the deodorant stick from his toiletries basket on the shelf and applies it quickly under both arms, lifting his gray t-shirt. A quick spray of cologne on the neck — two sprays, fast. He runs his fingers through his short dark hair, trying to flatten the sleep-pressed side. The mirror shows an imperfect but acceptable result. He brushes his teeth rapidly — a two-minute brush instead of the usual three. He spits, rinses, and drops the blue toothbrush back in the holder. He is dressed in yesterday's jeans and a fresh black t-shirt. Speed over perfection this morning.

### Scene 206: Evening Bathroom — Washing Hands After Dinner
**Time:** 7:00 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Santiago stands at the bathroom sink, washing his hands with the bar of soap after cooking and eating dinner. The soap lathers white between his fingers — he scrubs the cooking oil and food residue off. He rinses under the cold chrome faucet, the water running clear. He dries his hands on the blue towel. The mirror reflects his casual evening appearance — white t-shirt, gray joggers, silver chain necklace. The fluorescent light is steady and bright. He checks his teeth briefly in the mirror — clean. He exits the bathroom, leaving the light on for the next user.

### Scene 207: Checking Mirror Before Going Out
**Time:** 9:00 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Shared bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Santiago stands close to the rectangular mirror in the shared bathroom, checking his appearance before heading out for a DJ gig. He adjusts the silver chain necklace so the clasp is at the back. He turns his head left and right, checking the freshly shaved jawline. He runs a wet hand through his short dark hair, styling the top forward. The black graphic tee with the electronic music logo looks good against his medium brown skin. He sprays a final touch of cologne — the dark blue bottle reflects in the mirror. Satisfied, he nods to his reflection and turns off the bathroom light.

## SUPPLEMENTARY SCENES: STREET AND ENVIRONMENT (Various Times)

### Scene 208: Early Morning Kennedy Streets
**Time:** 8:50 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Kennedy neighborhood, riding
**Description:** Santiago rides through the Kennedy neighborhood in the early morning. The streets are waking up — a panadería has its door open, the smell of fresh pan de bono drifting out. A school bus stops at a corner, children in uniforms climbing aboard. A woman opens the metal shutters of a tienda, the metal clanking upward. An elderly man walks a small white dog on a leash. The morning air is cool, the overcast sky casting flat gray light. Santiago's motorcycle passes a colorful mural on a school wall depicting children playing. The Kennedy neighborhood feels familiar and safe — his daily starting point.

### Scene 209: Rush Hour Traffic — Gridlock
**Time:** 5:20 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Major avenue, stuck in traffic
**Description:** Santiago sits in complete gridlock on a major avenue during rush hour. The motorcycle inches forward between two lanes of stopped cars. A yellow taxi to his left has its driver's arm hanging out the window. A city bus to his right is packed with standing passengers, their faces visible through the foggy windows. Motorcycle exhaust mixes in the air. Traffic lights cycle green but no one moves. Santiago turns off the engine to save gas, balancing the motorcycle with both feet on the pavement. He checks his phone — the Rappi app shows no pending orders. He uses the time to text Carlos about music.

### Scene 210: Passing a School — Children Leaving
**Time:** 3:00 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Residential street near a school
**Description:** Santiago rides slowly past a public school at dismissal time. Children in navy and white uniforms pour out of the school gate, backpacks bouncing, laughing and shouting. Parents and grandparents wait on the sidewalk, some holding younger children's hands. A woman sells ice pops (bolis) from a cooler on wheels near the gate. Santiago slows to a crawl, careful of children who might dash into the street. A crossing guard in a reflective vest holds a stop sign, directing motorcycle and car traffic. The school building is two stories with a Colombian flag hanging above the entrance.

### Scene 211: Evening Kennedy — Tienda Social Scene
**Time:** 7:30 PM (alternate evening)
**Setting:** Corner tienda, Kennedy neighborhood
**Description:** Santiago stands outside a corner tienda in the Kennedy neighborhood, chatting with two friends from the area. The tienda's fluorescent interior light spills out onto the sidewalk. The group stands around a small metal table, each holding a cold soda or juice in a glass bottle. The tienda display window shows bags of chips, candy, and household items. A radio inside plays reggaeton. The neighborhood evening is alive — families on walks, kids on bicycles, the distant sound of a TV from an open window, the smell of someone cooking dinner nearby. Santiago laughs at a joke, his silver chain necklace catching the tienda light.

### Scene 212: Passing a TransMilenio Station
**Time:** 10:45 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Major avenue, riding past TransMilenio station
**Description:** Santiago rides past a TransMilenio station on the central dedicated lane of a major avenue. The station is an elevated glass-and-metal structure with turnstiles, digital route displays, and a crowd of waiting passengers visible inside. A red articulated TransMilenio bus pulls into the station, its doors opening with a hiss. Santiago remembers taking the TransMilenio before he got his motorcycle — the packed buses, the long waits, the transferring between routes. The motorcycle gives him freedom. He accelerates past the station, the avenue stretching ahead with its lanes of traffic, the TransMilenio lane a world apart in the center.

### Scene 213: Fruit Vendor Encounter
**Time:** 11:30 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Street corner, at fruit cart
**Description:** Santiago stops at a fruit vendor's cart on a street corner during a break between deliveries. The cart is a wooden pushcart loaded with fresh fruit — bright yellow mangoes, green-skinned papayas cut open to show orange flesh, brown-skinned lulos, red strawberries in plastic containers, and bunches of small bananas. The vendor, a man in a baseball cap, cuts a mango with a knife, scoring the flesh into cubes and handing it to Santiago on a napkin with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of salt. Santiago eats the mango standing beside his motorcycle, the juice running down his wrist.

### Scene 214: Navigating a Steep Hill
**Time:** 2:00 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Steep residential street, riding uphill
**Description:** Santiago rides the Honda CB 125 up a steep residential street — Bogotá's terrain includes significant hills, especially heading east toward the cerros. The motorcycle engine strains in a lower gear, the RPMs higher. The street is narrow and winding, lined with houses built on the hillside — some with stairs leading up to their doors. A view of the Bogotá valley opens behind him as he climbs — a vast expanse of the city spreading west under the overcast sky. The air is noticeably cooler at elevation. He leans forward on the motorcycle, distributing weight for the climb.

### Scene 215: Waiting at a Closed Restaurant
**Time:** 11:00 AM (alternate morning)
**Setting:** Restaurant storefront, closed
**Description:** Santiago arrives at a pickup address only to find the restaurant closed — metal shutters down, no lights inside. He checks the Rappi app — the order is still active. He calls the restaurant number listed in the app — no answer. He waits five minutes on the motorcycle, checking his phone. Finally, the app auto-cancels the order as the restaurant does not respond. A small frustration of the gig economy. He shrugs and accepts the next available order, a pickup three blocks away. The closed restaurant's sign — faded green letters on a white background — shows it is a lunchtime-only spot. Too early.

### Scene 216: Dog Chase on Residential Street
**Time:** 4:15 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Residential street, riding
**Description:** A medium-sized brown dog barks and chases Santiago's motorcycle down a residential street — a common hazard for delivery riders. Santiago accelerates gently to outpace the dog, which runs alongside for half a block before giving up and trotting back to its territory. Santiago glances in his mirror to confirm the dog has stopped. His heart beats faster for a moment. The residential street has a few other dogs lying in doorways, unbothered. A woman on a balcony above watches the chase with amusement. Santiago shakes his head inside his helmet and continues toward his delivery address.

### Scene 217: Sunset Over the Cerros
**Time:** 5:45 PM (alternate afternoon)
**Setting:** Kennedy street, view of mountains
**Description:** Santiago pauses the motorcycle on a Kennedy street with a clear eastward view. The sun, setting behind him in the west, lights up the cerros — the green eastern mountains — in vivid orange and gold. The sky above the mountains transitions from pale blue to pink to deep purple. The silhouette of Monserrate church is visible on the mountaintop. Santiago removes his helmet and takes a photo with his phone, the screen capturing the dramatic skyline. The Kennedy neighborhood rooftops stretch in the foreground — a patchwork of brick, corrugated metal, and flat concrete. It is a moment of beauty in an ordinary working day.

### Scene 218: Night Ride — Neon Reflections
**Time:** 11:30 PM (alternate night)
**Setting:** Commercial avenue, riding at night
**Description:** Santiago rides through a commercial avenue at night, the motorcycle headlight cutting through the darkness. Neon signs from shops, pharmacies, and restaurants reflect off the wet pavement — green, red, blue, and yellow streaks of light. A 24-hour droguería glows green. A fast-food restaurant has a bright interior visible through floor-to-ceiling windows. Car headlights create approaching white beams. Santiago's helmet visor reflects the colored neon as he passes. The Honda CB 125's chrome catches light in flashes. The avenue is less crowded at this hour — a few taxis, a bus, scattered pedestrians.

### Scene 219: Late Night Ride — Empty Streets
**Time:** 12:45 AM (alternate late night)
**Setting:** Kennedy residential street, riding at night
**Description:** Santiago rides through an almost empty Kennedy residential street late at night. The motorcycle headlight is the brightest light on the block. Street lamps cast dim orange pools every fifty meters. The houses are dark, metal security doors shut, curtains drawn. A single lit window shows a blue TV glow. The motorcycle engine is the loudest sound — echoing off the close brick walls. A stray cat darts across the street in the headlight beam, its eyes flashing green. The cool night air carries the faint smell of someone's late dinner cooking. Santiago rides carefully, aware that late-night streets can be unpredictable.

### Scene 220: Final Scene — The Motorcycle at Rest
**Time:** 1:00 AM (closing image)
**Setting:** Kennedy street, outside shared house
**Description:** The Honda CB 125 sits chained to its metal post on the quiet Kennedy street, engine off, cooling in the night air. The red and black paint is visible under the nearest street lamp's orange glow. The chrome mirrors reflect the empty street. The chain and lock are secure around the rear wheel and the post. The motorcycle's headlight is dark. Inside the shared house beyond the dark green security door, Santiago sleeps in his small room, the dark blue comforter pulled up, the DJ controller silent on the folding table, the orange Rappi backpack leaning against the wall. The small digital alarm clock reads 1:00. Tomorrow — another day of deliveries, another night of music, another step toward the dream.
