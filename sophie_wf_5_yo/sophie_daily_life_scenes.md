# A Day in the Life of Sophie: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Sophie, a 5-year-old kindergartener living in Portland, Oregon with her single mom Kate and pet hamster Biscuit.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Very young child character highly relatable to kindergarten-age learners
- Home, school, and daily routine vocabulary
- Pacific Northwest context (Portland, Oregon — rain, nature, coffee culture)
- Single-parent family dynamics (mom Kate, graphic designer working from home)
- Pet care vocabulary (hamster named Biscuit)
- Objects shown in real-world settings
- Cultural context embedded naturally

## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — BEDROOM (6:30 AM - 7:00 AM)

### Scene 001: Pre-Dawn Bedroom
**Time:** 6:30 AM — dim gray Portland morning light through curtains
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, wide view from doorway
**Description:** A small child's bedroom in a Portland apartment, quiet and still in the early morning. A 5-year-old girl with light skin and straight light brown hair sleeps curled up in a twin bed with a purple guardrail, tucked under a purple comforter printed with white stars. The lavender-painted walls are decorated with crayon drawings and finger paintings taped up with masking tape. A small white bookshelf is packed with colorful picture books, spines facing out. A wooden toy chest with a painted rainbow sits against one wall. On the low white dresser, a hamster cage glows faintly — inside, a golden Syrian hamster named Biscuit runs on a silver exercise wheel. A moon-shaped nightlight casts a soft amber glow near the bed. Glow-in-the-dark star stickers dot the ceiling above. The hardwood floor is covered by a soft lavender area rug. Dim gray Portland morning light seeps through the curtains, and the faint sound of rain taps against the window.

### Scene 002: Mom at the Doorway
**Time:** 6:32 AM — soft gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom doorway, view into room
**Description:** Kate, a 32-year-old woman with shoulder-length brown hair pulled into a loose bun, stands in the bedroom doorway holding a white ceramic mug of coffee. She wears a gray oversized sweatshirt and black leggings, her feet in fuzzy slippers. Her hand rests on the white wooden door frame as she leans in, mouth open as if calling softly to wake Sophie. The hallway behind her is lit by a single overhead light. Inside the bedroom, Sophie is still buried under the purple star comforter, only the top of her light brown hair visible against the white pillow. The moon-shaped nightlight glows amber. Biscuit the hamster rustles in his cage on the dresser, bedding shifting.

### Scene 003: Stirring Awake
**Time:** 6:34 AM — growing gray light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Sophie stirs under the purple star comforter, rolling onto her back. Her straight light brown hair is spread messily across the white pillow, strands stuck to her cheek. She wears light purple pajamas with a white stars print, the sleeves pushed up past her small wrists. One small hand with rosy-pink fingers rubs her eye. Her round face is scrunched in that half-awake expression of a child resisting morning. A worn stuffed bunny with floppy ears lies beside her on the pillow. A small plush giraffe has fallen to the floor during the night. The purple comforter is tangled around her legs. Rain patters softly against the bedroom window.

### Scene 004: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 6:35 AM — soft gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, side view of bed
**Description:** Sophie sits up slowly in bed, legs still under the purple star comforter. Her straight light brown hair is a tangled mess, pressed flat on one side from sleep. She yawns widely, revealing the gap where her missing front tooth used to be, both small hands stretching above her head with fingers spread. Her light purple star-print pajamas hang loosely on her small frame. The stuffed bunny sits propped against the pillow beside where her head was. On the low white dresser across the room, Biscuit the golden hamster is awake in his cage, standing on his hind legs with tiny paws against the cage bars, his water bottle hanging beside him. The moon-shaped nightlight has been switched off. Gray Portland morning light filters through the curtains.

### Scene 005: Feet on the Floor
**Time:** 6:36 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, low angle close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's small bare feet swinging over the edge of the twin bed and touching the soft lavender rug on the hardwood floor. The purple bed guardrail is visible at the edge of the bed frame. The bottom hem of her purple star-print pajama pants is visible above her ankles. Her toes wiggle against the soft rug fibers. Under the bed, a pair of velcro sneakers with rainbow stripes and a stray purple crayon are visible in the shadow. The wooden toy chest with its painted rainbow is partially visible beside the bed. The floor is cool hardwood beyond the rug's edge.

### Scene 006: Picking Up the Giraffe
**Time:** 6:37 AM — gray morning light growing
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, view from bed level
**Description:** Sophie bends down from the edge of the bed, reaching for the small plush giraffe that fell on the floor during the night. Her light brown hair cascades forward, hiding part of her round face. Her small hand grabs the yellow-and-brown spotted plush giraffe by its long neck. The lavender rug is beneath her feet. The white dresser with the hamster cage is visible in the background — Biscuit is drinking from his water bottle, tiny tongue lapping. Sophie places the giraffe back on the pillow next to the stuffed bunny, patting it gently. A crayon drawing of a sun and flowers taped to the wall is visible above the bed's headboard.

### Scene 007: Checking on Biscuit
**Time:** 6:38 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the dresser
**Description:** Sophie pads across the lavender rug to the low white dresser, standing on tiptoe to peer into Biscuit's cage. The wire cage has a green plastic base filled with wood shavings bedding. Biscuit, a golden-tan Syrian hamster with round black eyes and tiny pink ears, sits in the middle of his cage nibbling a sunflower seed held in his small paws. A silver exercise wheel stands at one end of the cage. A small red plastic water bottle hangs on the cage wall. A tiny ceramic food bowl with a few remaining pellets sits near a plastic igloo-shaped hideout. Sophie presses her face close to the cage bars, her hazel eyes wide with delight, her gap-toothed smile spreading. Her fingertips touch the cage wire gently.

### Scene 008: Talking to Biscuit
**Time:** 6:39 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up at hamster cage
**Description:** Sophie stands at the dresser, leaning close to the hamster cage, her mouth moving as she whispers good morning to Biscuit. The golden hamster has paused his seed-nibbling and turns his small furry head toward her voice, round black eyes blinking, whiskers twitching. Sophie's light brown hair falls forward in messy tangles. Her light purple star pajamas are rumpled from sleep. Her small fingers curl around the thin cage bars. On the dresser surface beside the cage, a small bag of hamster food pellets sits next to a container of sunflower seed treats. A child's drawing of a hamster — labeled "BISKIT" in wobbly crayon letters — is taped to the wall above the dresser.

### Scene 009: Making the Bed
**Time:** 6:41 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, view of bed
**Description:** Sophie stands beside her twin bed, pulling the purple star comforter up toward the pillow with both small hands. The comforter bunches unevenly — a 5-year-old's earnest but imperfect attempt at bed-making. She smooths it with her palms, pressing at the wrinkles. The purple bed guardrail frames one side. The stuffed bunny and plush giraffe sit on the pillow, slightly lopsided from being jostled. Morning light from the window falls in gray rectangles across the bed. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling above have faded to pale green dots in the daylight. The wooden toy chest with its rainbow is visible at the foot of the bed. Sophie steps back, tilting her head to look at her work.

### Scene 010: Placing Stuffed Animals
**Time:** 6:42 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up on bed
**Description:** Sophie arranges her stuffed animals on the now-made bed with careful attention. She props the worn stuffed bunny with its floppy brown ears against the pillow on the left and the plush giraffe on the right. Then she adds a small stuffed cat — orange tabby with a pink nose — from beside the pillow, tucking it between the two larger animals. Her small hands position each one just so, adjusting them to face forward. The purple star comforter is pulled up beneath the pillow, slightly lumpy. The white painted headboard frames the arrangement. Sophie puts her hands on her hips, surveying her work with a satisfied nod, her gap-toothed grin visible.

### Scene 011: Mom Brings Clothes
**Time:** 6:44 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, doorway and bed area
**Description:** Kate enters Sophie's bedroom carrying a small stack of folded clothes. She wears her gray sweatshirt and black leggings, coffee mug now absent. She sets the outfit on the edge of the bed: a bright teal t-shirt with a cartoon rainbow and clouds printed on the front, a pair of pink-and-white striped leggings, small white ankle socks with little hearts on them, and a pair of underwear. Sophie stands by the bed in her purple star pajamas, reaching for the rainbow t-shirt with an excited expression. The hamster cage is visible on the dresser behind them. Rain streaks the window glass in the background.

### Scene 012: Putting On the T-Shirt
**Time:** 6:45 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, mid-shot
**Description:** Sophie pulls the bright teal t-shirt with the rainbow-and-clouds print over her head, her light brown hair getting mussed as it pokes through the neck hole. Her small arms push through the short sleeves. Kate stands nearby, ready to help if needed, but Sophie insists on doing it herself. The shirt is slightly crooked — the rainbow design sits a bit off-center. Sophie's round face emerges through the collar, cheeks flushed pink from the effort, her gap-toothed smile triumphant. The purple star pajama bottoms are still on. The folded striped leggings and socks wait on the bed beside the stuffed bunny.

### Scene 013: Pulling On Leggings
**Time:** 6:46 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, seated on bed
**Description:** Sophie sits on the edge of the bed, pulling the pink-and-white striped leggings up over her feet and legs. She wiggles and tugs, the elastic waistband catching briefly before she pulls them up to her waist. Kate kneels beside the bed, helping straighten the legging legs so they are not bunched at the ankles. Sophie's teal rainbow t-shirt is on, slightly wrinkled from being pulled over her head. The purple star comforter is pushed aside where she sits. Her small bare feet poke out from the striped legging hems. The white ankle socks with hearts wait on the bed.

### Scene 014: Putting On Socks
**Time:** 6:47 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up on feet
**Description:** Sophie sits on the bed edge, pulling on small white ankle socks with tiny pink hearts printed on them. She stretches one sock open with both hands and tugs it onto her right foot, the fabric bunching slightly at the toes before she smooths it. She repeats with the left foot. Her pink-and-white striped leggings end just above the socks. Her small toes wiggle inside the socks, checking the fit. The lavender rug is under her dangling feet. The velcro sneakers with rainbow stripes sit on the floor nearby, ready to be put on. Kate watches from the doorway, arms crossed, smiling.

### Scene 015: Velcro Sneakers
**Time:** 6:48 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up on floor
**Description:** Sophie slides her sock-covered feet into her sneakers — white with rainbow stripe accents and sturdy velcro straps instead of laces. She presses the velcro strap on the right shoe down firmly with a satisfying ripping sound, then does the left. The sneakers are slightly scuffed from playground use. She stamps each foot once on the hardwood floor, testing the fit. The lavender rug is pushed aside. Her pink-and-white striped leggings are visible above the sneaker tops. A stray purple crayon rolls slightly from the vibration of her stamping. She stands up, fully dressed, and bounces on her toes.

### Scene 016: Mom Brushes Her Hair
**Time:** 6:50 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, near the bookshelf
**Description:** Sophie stands near the small white bookshelf while Kate kneels behind her, gently brushing Sophie's tangled light brown hair with a pink paddle brush. Sophie winces slightly as the brush catches a knot near the back of her head. Kate holds the hair above the tangle to reduce pulling, working through it patiently. A small basket on the bookshelf's top shelf holds colorful hair ties — pink, purple, green, yellow, and blue elastic bands with small plastic beads. The picture books on the shelves show colorful spines — titles about dinosaurs, rainbows, and kittens. Sophie holds a purple hair tie in her hand, ready for the ponytail.

### Scene 017: Messy Ponytail
**Time:** 6:52 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up from mirror perspective
**Description:** Kate gathers Sophie's brushed light brown hair into a ponytail at the back of her head, wrapping the purple elastic hair tie around it twice. The ponytail is slightly lopsided — a few wispy strands escape near Sophie's ears and forehead. Kate smooths them with her fingers but they spring free again. Sophie grins at herself in a small rectangular mirror propped on the bookshelf — her round face with rosy cheeks, hazel eyes bright, the gap from her missing front tooth visible in her smile. The teal rainbow t-shirt collar is visible at her neck. The basket of colorful hair ties sits on the shelf beside the mirror.

## PART 2: BREAKFAST & MORNING ROUTINE (7:00 AM - 7:50 AM)

### Scene 018: Walking to Kitchen
**Time:** 7:00 AM — gray morning light in hallway
**Setting:** Apartment hallway, viewed from behind Sophie
**Description:** Sophie walks down the narrow apartment hallway toward the kitchen, fully dressed in her teal rainbow t-shirt, pink-and-white striped leggings, and rainbow-striped velcro sneakers. Her light brown hair bounces in its messy ponytail with the purple hair tie. The hallway walls are off-white with a few framed photos — Sophie as a baby, Sophie and Kate at the beach, a sunset landscape. The hardwood floor continues from the bedroom. Ahead, the kitchen doorway opens into brighter light. The smell of coffee and toast drifts from the kitchen. Kate's voice calls from ahead, asking if Sophie wants oatmeal or cereal.

### Scene 019: Entering the Kitchen
**Time:** 7:01 AM — kitchen light mixed with gray daylight
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, wide view from doorway
**Description:** Sophie enters the small apartment kitchen. The space has white cabinets with silver handles, a gray laminate countertop, a white refrigerator covered in alphabet magnets and Sophie's drawings held up by fruit-shaped magnets. A small round wooden table with two mismatched chairs sits near the window — one adult-sized chair and one with a booster cushion for Sophie. The window above the sink shows a rainy Portland morning — gray sky, wet green trees, raindrops streaking the glass. A coffee maker on the counter drips dark coffee into a glass carafe. A toaster sits beside it. Kate stands at the counter, pouring coffee into her white ceramic mug. The overhead kitchen light is warm yellow.

### Scene 020: Climbing Onto Booster Chair
**Time:** 7:02 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Sophie climbs onto her chair at the small round wooden table, using both hands to pull herself up. A blue foam booster cushion sits on the chair seat, raising her to table height. She settles onto the cushion, scooting forward until her stomach touches the table edge. Her velcro sneakers dangle above the floor — she is too short for her feet to reach. The table surface is light wood with a few ring stains from mugs. A blue plastic placemat with a cartoon dinosaur print marks Sophie's spot. A small purple plastic cup and a child's spoon with a thick rubber handle wait on the placemat. Kate moves around the kitchen behind her.

### Scene 021: Bowl of Oatmeal
**Time:** 7:04 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the table close-up
**Description:** Kate places a small yellow bowl of oatmeal in front of Sophie on the dinosaur placemat. The oatmeal is topped with a smiley face made from blueberries — two blueberry eyes and a curved blueberry mouth. A drizzle of honey glistens on top in a golden zigzag. A small spoon with a thick green rubber handle rests in the bowl. Sophie's hazel eyes widen with delight at the blueberry face, her mouth open in an excited gasp, gap-toothed grin spreading. Her small hands grip the table edge. The purple plastic cup has been filled with orange juice, a splash of color on the blue placemat.

### Scene 022: Eating Oatmeal
**Time:** 7:06 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Sophie holds the green-handled spoon in her right fist — a child's grip, the whole hand wrapped around the handle — and scoops a messy spoonful of oatmeal with blueberries. She brings it to her mouth, some oatmeal dripping off the spoon back into the yellow bowl. Her round face concentrates on the task, tongue poking out slightly. A small smear of oatmeal appears on her chin. The teal rainbow t-shirt is visible above the table edge. Kate sits in the other chair across the small table, both hands wrapped around her white coffee mug, watching Sophie with a warm smile. Rain continues against the kitchen window behind them.

### Scene 023: Drinking Orange Juice
**Time:** 7:08 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, close-up at table
**Description:** Sophie lifts her purple plastic cup with both small hands and takes a long sip of orange juice. The cup is a child's sippy cup without the lid — she graduated from lids recently. A small dribble of orange juice escapes the corner of her mouth and runs down her chin. She sets the cup down with a soft thunk on the dinosaur placemat, the juice level noticeably lower. She wipes her chin with the back of her hand, smearing oatmeal and juice together. Kate reaches across the table with a paper napkin, dabbing at Sophie's chin. The yellow oatmeal bowl is half-empty, the blueberry smiley face now disrupted.

### Scene 024: Banana Slices
**Time:** 7:10 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Kate places a small green plastic plate with banana slices arranged in a fan shape next to Sophie's oatmeal bowl. The banana rounds are bright yellow-white, freshly cut. Sophie picks up a banana slice with her fingers and pops it into her mouth, cheeks puffing as she chews. Her light brown ponytail sways as she bobs her head while chewing. The oatmeal bowl is mostly empty now, a smear of honey and a few blueberries remaining. The purple cup of orange juice sits half-full. On the counter behind them, the coffee maker has finished dripping. A bunch of green bananas hangs from a wooden banana hook on the counter. The refrigerator with its alphabet magnets and drawings is visible in the background.

### Scene 025: Mom's Coffee and Conversation
**Time:** 7:12 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, wide view of table
**Description:** Sophie and Kate sit together at the small round kitchen table. Kate holds her white coffee mug in both hands, steam rising from the dark liquid inside. Sophie leans forward on her elbows, mouth moving animatedly, telling her mom about a dream she had — her small hands gesture in the air. The yellow oatmeal bowl is pushed aside, spoon resting in it. The green plate has two remaining banana slices. The purple cup is nearly empty. Through the kitchen window, Portland's gray sky and rain-slicked tree branches are visible. A wooden clock on the wall above the refrigerator shows 7:12. The kitchen is small but warm, the yellow overhead light creating a cozy glow.

### Scene 026: Wiping the Table
**Time:** 7:15 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Sophie slides off her booster chair, feet landing on the kitchen floor with a soft thud. She picks up a damp blue sponge from the counter edge — standing on tiptoe to reach — and wipes the table surface where her placemat was, spreading crumbs and a smear of oatmeal around in wobbly circles. Her effort is enthusiastic but imperfect. Kate carries the yellow bowl and green plate to the sink behind her. The dinosaur placemat has been moved to the counter. Sophie's light brown ponytail swings as she scrubs. The small table surface is wet with sponge streaks. The booster cushion sits crooked on the chair.

### Scene 027: Washing Hands at Kitchen Sink
**Time:** 7:17 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, at the sink
**Description:** Sophie stands on a small white plastic step stool at the kitchen sink, her hands under the running faucet. The water flows over her small fingers, washing away oatmeal and banana residue. A bottle of green dish soap with a pump top sits on the counter beside the sink. She pumps soap once — too much comes out, a big green glob in her palm — and she rubs her hands together, creating excessive bubbles. Kate stands beside her, sleeves pushed up, rinsing the breakfast dishes. Through the window above the sink, the rainy Portland morning is visible — wet sidewalk, a neighbor's green hedge, parked cars glistening with rain. Sophie's velcro sneakers are planted firmly on the step stool.

---

## PART 3: BATHROOM — MORNING ROUTINE (7:20 AM - 7:40 AM)

### Scene 028: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 7:20 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom doorway
**Description:** Sophie walks into the small apartment bathroom, pushing the white door open with one hand. The bathroom has white subway tile walls and gray tile floor. A single pedestal sink with a chrome faucet has a round mirror mounted above it. A white plastic step stool sits in front of the sink. The toilet has a child's blue potty seat adapter on top. The bathtub to the right has a light blue shower curtain printed with cartoon fish. Colorful items mark this as a shared family bathroom — a green hooded frog towel hangs on a low hook Sophie can reach, while adult-sized white towels hang on higher hooks. A purple kids' toothbrush sits in a ceramic frog-shaped holder on the sink edge. The overhead light is bright and white. Sophie's velcro sneakers tap on the gray tile.

### Scene 029: Stepping Onto the Step Stool
**Time:** 7:21 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at the sink
**Description:** Sophie steps up onto the white plastic step stool in front of the pedestal sink, rising to a comfortable height to see herself in the round mirror. Her reflection shows a 5-year-old girl with light skin, rosy cheeks, light brown hair in a messy ponytail, wearing a teal rainbow t-shirt and pink-and-white striped leggings. She grips the edge of the sink with both small hands, steadying herself on the stool. In the frog-shaped ceramic holder on the sink edge, her purple kids' toothbrush stands upright beside a taller white adult toothbrush — mom's. A tube of kids' bubblegum-flavored toothpaste with a cartoon character on the label sits beside the holder. A bar of white soap rests in a small ceramic dish near the faucet.

### Scene 030: Squeezing Toothpaste
**Time:** 7:22 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, close-up on hands
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's small hands holding her purple kids' toothbrush in one hand and squeezing the bubblegum toothpaste tube with the other. The tube is pink and blue with a smiling cartoon tooth character on the label. A blob of sparkly blue-pink toothpaste curls onto the purple bristles — she squeezes a bit too much, and it bulges over the edge. She tilts the brush quickly to keep it from falling off, her tongue poking out in concentration. The chrome faucet and white ceramic sink basin are blurred in the background. The frog-shaped toothbrush holder is visible at the edge of the frame, one slot now empty.

### Scene 031: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 7:23 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Sophie brushes her teeth with the purple kids' toothbrush, moving it back and forth across her front teeth. Pink-blue foam forms around her mouth, some bubbling at the corners. She watches herself in the round mirror, concentrating on brushing the way mom taught her. Her reflection shows a small girl with rosy cheeks, light brown ponytail, standing on the white step stool. The gap where her missing front tooth was is visible as she brushes around it carefully. She tilts her head to reach the side teeth, mouth open wide, hazel eyes focused on her reflection. The bubblegum toothpaste tube lies on its side on the sink edge.

### Scene 032: Spitting and Rinsing
**Time:** 7:25 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, side angle at sink
**Description:** Sophie leans over the sink and spits toothpaste foam into the white ceramic basin. Blue-pink foam swirls with the running water from the chrome faucet and slides toward the drain. She cups water in her small hand — most of it splashing back into the sink before reaching her mouth — swishes what she caught, and spits again. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, leaving a smear of foam on her cheek. She rinses the purple toothbrush under the faucet and places it back in the frog-shaped holder. A few foam spots dot the mirror and sink edge. The step stool wobbles slightly as she shifts her weight.

### Scene 033: Washing Face
**Time:** 7:26 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Sophie cups both small hands under the running faucet and splashes water on her round face. Water runs down her rosy cheeks and drips from her chin into the basin. She squeezes her eyes shut against the splashing, mouth pursed. Droplets spatter the round mirror. Her messy ponytail has gotten slightly damp at the edges near her forehead. She grabs the bar of white soap from the ceramic dish and rubs it between her wet hands, creating a lather, then pats her soapy hands on her cheeks. The soap is slippery and almost escapes her grip, sliding across the sink edge before she catches it.

### Scene 034: Drying Face with Frog Towel
**Time:** 7:27 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Sophie reaches for her green hooded frog towel hanging on the low hook — the hood has two round frog eyes on top and the towel is bright green terrycloth. She pulls it off the hook and presses the soft fabric against her wet face, patting dry. The frog hood flops over the top of her head briefly, the round frog eyes sitting comically above her forehead. She lowers the towel, face now fresh and awake, and hangs it back on the low hook carefully. Her hazel eyes are bright in the mirror reflection. Water spots remain on the sink and mirror. The white step stool creaks slightly as she steps off it.

### Scene 035: Using the Toilet
**Time:** 7:29 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, side view
**Description:** Sophie sits on the toilet, which has a blue child's potty seat adapter on top of the regular seat to make it the right size for her. Her pink-and-white striped leggings are pushed down to her ankles, her velcro sneakers still on her feet. She sits with her small hands gripping the edges of the potty seat, feet dangling above the gray tile floor — they do not reach the ground. The light blue fish-print shower curtain is visible to her right. A roll of white toilet paper sits on a chrome holder on the wall at her height. She looks straight ahead, waiting patiently, her messy ponytail visible from the side.

### Scene 036: Washing Hands After Toilet
**Time:** 7:31 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Sophie stands back on the white step stool at the sink, her hands under the running chrome faucet. She pumps the liquid hand soap dispenser — a clear bottle with pink soap — and rubs her small hands together under the water, creating pink bubbles. She scrubs her palms, then the backs of her hands, then between her fingers — the way mom taught her, counting to twenty. The water runs pink-tinged bubbles into the basin. The round mirror reflects her concentrated face, tongue poking out as she scrubs thoroughly. The frog-shaped toothbrush holder and toothpaste tube are visible on the sink edge. She shakes her hands over the sink, sending droplets flying.

### Scene 037: Drying Hands
**Time:** 7:32 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Bathroom, near towel hook
**Description:** Sophie steps off the white step stool and reaches for her green frog towel on the low hook, drying her hands by rubbing them in the soft green terrycloth. She squeezes the towel between her small fingers, making sure each hand is dry. A few water drops remain on the gray tile floor near the step stool where she splashed. She hangs the frog towel back on its hook, adjusting it so the frog eyes face outward. The bathroom is tidy — toothbrush in holder, soap in dish, step stool pushed against the sink cabinet. The bright overhead light illuminates the white subway tile walls. Sophie turns to leave, her sneakers squeaking on the slightly damp tile.

## PART 4: GETTING READY TO LEAVE (7:40 AM - 8:00 AM)

### Scene 038: Feeding Biscuit
**Time:** 7:40 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the dresser
**Description:** Sophie stands at the low white dresser, carefully opening the wire door of Biscuit's cage. Kate stands beside her, supervising. Sophie reaches into a small paper bag of hamster food pellets and scoops a small handful of brown pellets into the tiny ceramic food bowl inside the cage. A few pellets bounce off the rim and land in the wood shavings bedding. Biscuit the golden hamster emerges from his plastic igloo hideout, nose twitching, round black eyes bright, and immediately begins nibbling a pellet held in his tiny paws. Sophie watches with delight, her gap-toothed smile wide, hazel eyes sparkling. The silver exercise wheel gleams in the cage. The red water bottle hangs full on the cage wall.

### Scene 039: Giving Biscuit Fresh Water
**Time:** 7:42 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the dresser
**Description:** Kate helps Sophie remove the red plastic water bottle from the side of Biscuit's cage. Sophie holds the bottle carefully with both hands — it is a small tube with a metal drinking spout. Kate unscrews the cap and takes the bottle to refill while Sophie watches Biscuit through the cage bars. The golden hamster is stuffing his cheek pouches with food pellets, his face comically round and bulging on both sides. Sophie giggles, pressing her face close to the bars. The cage bedding is slightly scattered from Biscuit's nighttime activity, kicked up around the exercise wheel. The container of sunflower seed treats sits on the dresser beside the cage. Kate returns and clips the refilled water bottle back onto the cage wall.

### Scene 040: Closing the Cage
**Time:** 7:44 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up at cage
**Description:** Sophie carefully latches the wire cage door shut with both hands, making sure the small metal clip is secure. Kate checks the latch after her — a safety double-check. Biscuit has retreated to his plastic igloo hideout with his cheek pouches full, only his golden rump and tiny tail visible in the hideout entrance. The cage is tidy — fresh food in the ceramic bowl, full water bottle, clean exercise wheel. Sophie presses her fingertips against the cage wire one more time. "Bye Biscuit, be good," she whispers. The crayon drawing of "BISKIT" on the wall above watches over the cage. Sophie's teal rainbow t-shirt and messy ponytail are reflected in the dresser's surface.

### Scene 041: Backpack by the Door
**Time:** 7:46 AM — gray hallway light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway/hallway
**Description:** Sophie walks to the apartment's small entryway near the front door, where her backpack hangs on a low coat hook. The backpack is small — sized for a kindergartener — bright pink with a cartoon cat face on the front pocket, complete with embroidered whiskers and pointed ears. She pulls it off the hook with both hands, the weight swinging slightly. Below the hooks, a shoe rack holds several pairs of shoes — Kate's rain boots, Kate's sneakers, and Sophie's red polka-dot rain boots. A tall wooden coat rack holds Kate's olive green rain jacket and Sophie's bright yellow rain jacket. An umbrella stand with two umbrellas — one black adult-sized, one small purple child-sized — stands beside the door. A welcome mat reads "Home Sweet Home" in faded letters.

### Scene 042: Putting On Rain Boots
**Time:** 7:48 AM — gray hallway light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway, on the floor
**Description:** Sophie sits on the hallway floor, pulling on her red rain boots with white polka dots. She tugs the right boot on over her sneaker — no, wait, Kate reminds her to take off the sneakers first. Sophie kicks off the velcro sneakers and slides her sock-covered feet into the rain boots instead. The boots are bright cherry red with cheerful white polka dots, reaching just below her knees. She stamps each foot on the floor, testing the fit. Her pink-and-white striped leggings tuck into the boot tops. The discarded velcro sneakers lie on the welcome mat. Kate picks them up and tucks them into Sophie's pink cat-face backpack. The shoe rack and coat hooks are visible behind Sophie.

### Scene 043: Yellow Rain Jacket
**Time:** 7:50 AM — gray hallway light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway
**Description:** Kate helps Sophie put on her bright yellow rain jacket. Sophie pushes her arms through the sleeves — the jacket is slightly big, the sleeves extending past her wrists until Kate rolls the cuffs once. Kate zips the jacket up the front with a silver zipper, then pulls the yellow hood up over Sophie's light brown ponytail. The hood frames Sophie's round face with rosy cheeks, hazel eyes peering out. The jacket has two front pockets with snap buttons and a reflective strip across the back. Sophie's red polka-dot rain boots are visible below the yellow jacket. She looks like a small bright sunflower against the gray Portland morning visible through the front door's side window. The pink cat-face backpack sits ready on the floor.

### Scene 044: Backpack On
**Time:** 7:52 AM — gray hallway light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway
**Description:** Kate lifts Sophie's pink cat-face backpack and helps her slide her arms through the straps over the yellow rain jacket. The backpack sits high on Sophie's small back, the cartoon cat face with embroidered whiskers visible. The straps are adjusted short for her small frame. Sophie bounces on her toes in her red polka-dot rain boots, ready to go. Kate grabs her own olive green rain jacket from the coat rack and her car keys from a small ceramic bowl on a shelf by the door — the bowl is handmade, slightly lopsided, painted by Sophie at a pottery class. A set of house keys jangles on a keyring with a small Subaru logo. Kate checks her phone — a slim black rectangle — for the time.

### Scene 045: Locking the Apartment Door
**Time:** 7:55 AM — overcast outdoor light
**Setting:** Apartment building hallway, outside front door
**Description:** Kate and Sophie stand in the apartment building's hallway as Kate locks the front door with a silver key. The hallway has beige carpet and cream walls with apartment numbers on brass plates. Sophie stands beside Kate, looking up at her mom, the yellow rain jacket hood pushed slightly back. Her pink cat-face backpack is on her back. Kate wears her olive green rain jacket, brown hair still in its loose bun, carrying a reusable tote bag over one shoulder — canvas with a Portland farmer's market logo. The hallway is lit by fluorescent ceiling panels. A neighbor's doormat with a cat silhouette is visible across the hall. Sophie holds Kate's free hand, her small fingers wrapped around two of Kate's fingers.

## PART 5: CAR RIDE TO SCHOOL (8:00 AM - 8:20 AM)

### Scene 046: Walking to the Car
**Time:** 8:00 AM — overcast, light rain
**Setting:** Apartment parking lot
**Description:** Sophie and Kate walk through the apartment building's small parking lot in the light Portland rain. Kate holds Sophie's hand, both of them in rain jackets — Kate in olive green, Sophie in bright yellow. Sophie's red polka-dot rain boots splash through a shallow puddle on the asphalt, sending up a small spray of water. She grins at the splash, gap-toothed and delighted. Their used Subaru Outback is parked nearby — dark blue with a few minor dents, a "Portland Farmers Market" bumper sticker on the back, and a child's car seat visible through the rear window. Wet green trees line the parking lot edge. The sky is uniformly gray. Rain dots the car's windshield. Kate clicks the key fob and the Outback's orange hazard lights blink twice.

### Scene 047: Getting Into the Car Seat
**Time:** 8:02 AM — overcast, car interior
**Setting:** Back seat of Subaru Outback
**Description:** Kate opens the rear passenger door of the dark blue Subaru Outback and helps Sophie climb into her booster car seat. The booster seat is gray and pink with a five-point harness. Sophie turns and sits down, her yellow rain jacket crinkling against the seat. Kate reaches across and buckles the harness straps, clicking the chest clip into place and tightening the straps snugly. Sophie's pink cat-face backpack is placed on the seat beside her. Her red polka-dot rain boots dangle above the floor mat — her legs are too short to reach. A few children's books and a small stuffed bear are scattered on the back seat. A sippy cup sits in the cupholder of the booster seat. Rain patters on the car roof above.

### Scene 048: Driving Through Portland
**Time:** 8:05 AM — overcast, light rain
**Setting:** Inside Subaru Outback, view from back seat
**Description:** View from Sophie's perspective in the back seat booster seat, looking forward through the rain-streaked windshield. Kate drives, both hands on the steering wheel, her olive green jacket visible. The windshield wipers sweep back and forth rhythmically, clearing the rain. Through the windshield, a Portland residential street unfolds — tree-lined with tall Douglas firs and maples, their green canopy dripping rain. Colorful houses in grays, blues, and greens with covered porches line the street. A cyclist in a neon yellow vest rides in the bike lane. A coffee shop with a lit-up sign passes on the right. Sophie watches the wipers go back and forth, her hazel eyes following their motion. Her small hands rest on the harness straps across her chest.

### Scene 049: Puddle Watching
**Time:** 8:08 AM — overcast, light rain
**Setting:** Inside Subaru Outback, Sophie's window view
**Description:** Sophie presses her face against the rain-streaked rear window of the Subaru, watching the Portland streets pass by. Her breath fogs a circle on the cold glass. Raindrops race each other down the window — she follows them with her fingertip on the glass, picking her favorite to win. Outside the window, a large puddle at a street corner reflects the gray sky and the green canopy of a Douglas fir tree. A dog-walker in a red rain jacket leads a golden retriever on a leash through the rain. A MAX light rail train is visible in the distance. Sophie's yellow rain jacket hood is pushed down, her messy ponytail pressed against the booster seat headrest. The car seat harness crosses her chest.

### Scene 050: Arriving at School
**Time:** 8:15 AM — overcast
**Setting:** School parking lot/drop-off zone
**Description:** The dark blue Subaru Outback pulls into the school's drop-off zone. Through the windshield, a single-story public elementary school building is visible — brick and painted cinder block in warm beige, with a covered entrance and a colorful mural of children holding hands painted on the wall near the front doors. A line of cars drops off children ahead of them. Kids in rain jackets of every color — red, blue, purple, green — hurry toward the entrance with parents or alone. A crossing guard in an orange vest holds a stop sign. American flag hangs damp on a flagpole. Trees surrounding the school grounds are lush green — Portland's famous greenery — dripping with rain. Sophie unbuckles her chest clip with practiced hands and wiggles in her booster seat, eager to go.

### Scene 051: Goodbye Kiss
**Time:** 8:18 AM — overcast, school entrance
**Setting:** School drop-off zone, outside car
**Description:** Kate has come around to Sophie's door, opened it, and lifted Sophie out of the booster seat onto the wet sidewalk. Sophie's red polka-dot rain boots land in a small puddle. Kate kneels down to Sophie's height, adjusting the yellow rain jacket hood over her ponytail, and gives Sophie a kiss on her rosy cheek. Sophie wraps her small arms around Kate's neck in a tight hug, the pink cat-face backpack shifting on her back. Kate whispers "Have a great day, sweetpea." Sophie pulls back, gap-toothed grin beaming, and waves. Other parents and children bustle past them. A teacher in a blue raincoat stands at the school entrance, greeting arriving students. The American flag drips overhead.

## PART 6: KINDERGARTEN MORNING (8:30 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Scene 052: Entering the Classroom
**Time:** 8:30 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom doorway
**Description:** Sophie walks into her kindergarten classroom, pulling off her yellow rain jacket hood. The room is bright and colorful — an alphabet banner in red, blue, and green letters runs along the top of the white walls. Small round tables with tiny chairs in primary colors — red, blue, yellow, green — are arranged around the room. Near the door, wooden cubbies with paper name labels line the wall, each cubby holding a child's backpack and jacket. Sophie's cubby is labeled "SOPHIE" in purple marker with a small star sticker beside it. A colorful ABC rug covers the center of the floor. A reading corner with three bean bag chairs — red, blue, and green — sits in one corner beside a low bookshelf. The fish tank with two goldfish glows blue-green on a counter near the windows. Large windows show the rainy Portland sky and green trees outside.

### Scene 053: Hanging Up Rain Jacket
**Time:** 8:31 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, cubby area
**Description:** Sophie stands at the wooden cubbies near the classroom door, pulling off her yellow rain jacket. She hangs it on the small coat hook inside her cubby — the one labeled "SOPHIE" in purple marker with a star. Her pink cat-face backpack is already stuffed into the cubby shelf. Other children's jackets crowd the surrounding cubbies — a red jacket, a blue one with dinosaurs, a purple one with flowers. Sophie's neighbor cubby belongs to "EMMA" and has a sparkly pink jacket. Sophie smooths down her teal rainbow t-shirt, which got bunched under the rain jacket. Her messy ponytail has loosened, wisps of light brown hair framing her round face. She bends to pull off her red polka-dot rain boots, revealing her white heart-print socks, and places the boots on the floor of her cubby. She slides on her velcro sneakers from the backpack.

### Scene 054: Circle Time Gathering
**Time:** 8:40 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, center rug area
**Description:** Sophie sits cross-legged on the large colorful ABC rug in the center of the classroom with about fifteen other kindergarteners. The children form a rough circle, sitting on different letters of the alphabet. Sophie sits on the letter "S," her legs crossed, hands in her lap, velcro sneakers visible. She wears her teal rainbow t-shirt and pink-and-white striped leggings. Her light brown ponytail is slightly askew. The other children are a diverse group — different skin tones, hair colors, and clothing. The teacher, Mrs. Chen — a 40-year-old woman with short black hair and glasses, wearing a blue cardigan and a lanyard with an ID badge — sits in a low chair at the front of the circle, holding a large picture book. The alphabet banner is visible on the wall above. The calendar wall with the weather chart shows today's date and a cloud-with-rain icon.

### Scene 055: Calendar and Weather
**Time:** 8:45 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, calendar wall
**Description:** Mrs. Chen stands at the calendar wall, pointing to today's date with a wooden pointer stick. The calendar is large, colorful, with removable number cards in a pocket chart. The days of the week are listed across the top in different colors. Below the calendar, a weather chart has velcro icons — sun, cloud, rain, snow, wind — and a child has placed the rain cloud icon in the "Today's Weather" slot. Sophie stands beside the weather chart, having been chosen as today's weather helper. She presses the rain cloud icon firmly onto the velcro strip with both small hands, beaming with pride at her important job. Her gap-toothed smile is wide. The other children sit on the ABC rug behind her, watching. A class schedule chart beside the calendar lists the day's activities with picture icons.

### Scene 056: Alphabet Song
**Time:** 8:50 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, circle on rug
**Description:** Sophie sits on the ABC rug with her classmates, mouth open wide, singing the alphabet song. Mrs. Chen points to each letter on the alphabet banner above the whiteboard as the class sings. Sophie's small hand reaches up, pointing along with the teacher, her index finger tracking the letters from A to Z. Her hazel eyes follow the colorful letters — each one is a different color with a picture: A-apple, B-ball, C-cat, and so on. The children's voices are enthusiastic and slightly off-key. Sophie mouths "L-M-N-O-P" all as one word, the way young children do. Her round face is flushed with the effort of singing loudly. The fish tank bubbles softly in the background.

### Scene 057: Learning the Letter D
**Time:** 9:00 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at a small round table in a tiny red chair, working on a letter worksheet. The worksheet shows a large dotted-line letter "D" for her to trace with a fat yellow pencil — the triangular kind made for small hands. She grips the pencil in her fist and traces the curved part of the D, her tongue poking out in concentration. The traced line wobbles but follows the dots. Below the letter, small pictures of things that start with D — a dog, a duck, a drum, a door — are printed in black outline for coloring. Sophie has already colored the dog brown with a crayon from a small cup of crayons in the center of the table. Two other children sit at the same table, working on their own worksheets. Mrs. Chen's desk is visible in the corner with a small apple-shaped pencil holder.

### Scene 058: Coloring the Duck
**Time:** 9:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, close-up at table
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's small hand gripping a yellow crayon, coloring in the outline of a duck on her letter D worksheet. She colors in broad, uneven strokes that go outside the lines — typical for a 5-year-old. The duck is mostly yellow with an orange crayon used for the beak. A green crayon has been used to add grass beneath the duck — Sophie's own addition, not part of the original outline. The cup of crayons in the center of the table holds about twelve colors, some with broken tips and peeled paper labels. The fat yellow pencil lies beside the worksheet. Sophie's other hand rests flat on the paper, holding it steady. Crayon shavings are scattered on the table surface. Her teal rainbow t-shirt sleeve is visible at the edge of the frame.

### Scene 059: Counting with Blocks
**Time:** 9:15 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the small round table with a pile of colorful wooden counting blocks in front of her. The blocks are cubes in red, blue, yellow, and green, each about an inch square. Mrs. Chen has asked them to count out groups of five. Sophie carefully moves blocks one at a time from the pile, placing them in a line: one red, two blue, three yellow, four green, five red. She counts aloud, lips moving with each block — "one, two, free, four, five" — her lisp on "three" from the missing tooth. She holds up her left hand with all five fingers spread, comparing her fingers to the five blocks. Two classmates at the table count their own blocks. A number line from 1-20 is taped to the table edge. The blocks make small clacking sounds as they touch.

### Scene 060: Glue Stick Craft
**Time:** 9:30 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, art supply area
**Description:** Sophie stands at the art supply station — a long low table against the wall covered in newspaper for mess protection. She holds a purple glue stick, twisting the bottom to push up the adhesive, and smears it across the back of a pre-cut construction paper circle — bright orange. She is making a paper caterpillar by gluing circles in a row on a piece of green construction paper. Three circles are already glued down — red, yellow, and blue — forming the caterpillar's body. She presses the orange circle onto the paper firmly with her palm. A small cup of googly eyes, a pair of child-safe round-tipped scissors with green handles, and a pile of pre-cut circles in various colors are spread across the table. Finger paint jars — red, blue, yellow — sit on a shelf above the table. Sophie has a small smear of glue on her cheek.

### Scene 061: Adding Googly Eyes
**Time:** 9:35 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, art supply area close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's small fingers picking up two small plastic googly eyes from the cup and carefully pressing them onto the first red circle of her paper caterpillar — the head. The googly eyes have white backing with small black pupils that rattle loosely inside the plastic dome. She places them side by side, pressing hard with her thumbs. The caterpillar now has a face — two wobbly googly eyes on the red circle head, followed by yellow, blue, orange, and now a green circle body, all glued to the green construction paper. Sophie reaches for a black crayon and draws a small curved smile on the red head circle. She adds two small antennae — wobbly black lines sticking up from the top of the head. She holds up her creation, arms extended, admiring it with her head tilted. Glue stick residue shines on her fingers.

### Scene 062: Snack Time
**Time:** 10:00 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the small round table with her classmates for snack time. In front of her is a small paper plate with apple slices — red skin, white flesh — and a handful of goldfish crackers arranged in a little pile. A small carton of white milk with a tiny straw punched through the top sits beside the plate. Sophie picks up an apple slice and bites into it, juice running down her chin. Her gap-toothed bite leaves a small, distinctive mark in the apple. Across the table, other children eat their snacks — one has cheese and crackers, another has a banana. A paper towel serves as a napkin under Sophie's plate. Mrs. Chen walks between the tables, checking on everyone. The classroom clock on the wall shows 10:00. Sophie's caterpillar craft is drying on a rack by the window.

### Scene 063: Drinking Milk
**Time:** 10:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, close-up at table
**Description:** Sophie holds the small milk carton with both hands and sips through the tiny straw, her cheeks hollowing as she sucks. The white milk travels up through the transparent straw. She lowers the carton, a white milk mustache visible above her upper lip. She licks it off with her tongue, then grins — the gap where her front tooth is missing makes her milk-mustache grin especially charming. The paper plate has a few remaining goldfish crackers and one apple slice core. Cracker crumbs dot the table surface. She picks up a single goldfish cracker between her thumb and forefinger and pops it in her mouth, crunching happily. Her teal rainbow t-shirt has a small apple juice stain near the collar.

### Scene 064: Recess — Coat Hooks
**Time:** 10:15 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, coat hook area
**Description:** Sophie stands at the coat hook area by the classroom door, pulling on her yellow rain jacket for outdoor recess. The rain has lightened to a drizzle. Other children bustle around her, grabbing jackets and boots from cubbies. Sophie zips up her yellow jacket with both hands on the zipper pull, tugging it up to her chin. She pulls the hood over her ponytail. She bends down and pulls on her red polka-dot rain boots over her sneakers — they fit loosely over the sneakers but she does not care. A line of children forms at the classroom door, bouncing with energy. Mrs. Chen stands at the door, counting heads. The alphabet banner and bright classroom colors are visible behind the chaotic scene of twenty children putting on rain gear simultaneously.

### Scene 065: Playground — Swinging
**Time:** 10:20 AM — overcast, light drizzle
**Setting:** School playground, at the swing set
**Description:** Sophie sits on a black rubber swing seat on the school playground, gripping the cold metal chains with both small hands in her yellow rain jacket. Kate — no, a playground aide in an orange vest pushes her gently from behind. Sophie swings forward, red polka-dot rain boots stretched out in front of her against the gray Portland sky, light brown ponytail flying behind her under the yellow hood. She laughs, mouth open wide showing her gap-toothed grin, hazel eyes squinted with joy. The swing set has four swings with a green metal frame. The playground has wet wood chips on the ground, dark and sodden from rain. A climbing structure with a blue slide is visible in the background. Other children in colorful rain jackets run and play. Tall Douglas fir trees line the school grounds, their green needles dripping.

### Scene 066: Playground — Slide
**Time:** 10:25 AM — overcast, drizzle stopped
**Setting:** School playground, at the climbing structure
**Description:** Sophie climbs the wet metal ladder of the playground climbing structure, her red rain boots gripping each rung carefully. Her yellow rain jacket is bright against the gray sky. She reaches the top platform — a small enclosed area with a roof — and waves down at a friend below. Then she sits at the top of the blue plastic slide, which has a thin layer of rainwater on its surface. She pushes off with both hands, sliding down with a "wheee" expression on her face — mouth open, eyes wide, light brown hair streaming behind her. Water from the slide soaks the back of her leggings. She lands at the bottom on the wet wood chips, stumbling slightly but catching herself, laughing. Her red boots are splattered with wet wood chip debris.

### Scene 067: Playground — Puddle Jumping
**Time:** 10:30 AM — overcast
**Setting:** School playground, blacktop area
**Description:** Sophie stands at the edge of a large puddle on the school playground's blacktop area, eyes fixed on the water with intense focus. Her yellow rain jacket is zipped up, hood down, messy ponytail escaping. She takes a running start — three small stomping steps — and leaps with both feet into the center of the puddle. Her red polka-dot rain boots slam into the water, sending a magnificent spray of gray water outward in all directions. Droplets arc through the air, catching the flat overcast light. Sophie's face is pure joy — mouth wide open in a laugh, hazel eyes sparkling, arms thrown out to the sides for balance. Water splashes up her striped leggings. Another child in a blue rain jacket stands nearby, covering their face from the spray, also laughing. A teacher's whistle lanyard is visible in the background.

### Scene 068: Back Inside — Removing Rain Gear
**Time:** 10:35 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, cubby area
**Description:** Sophie peels off her damp yellow rain jacket at her cubby, the fabric clinging slightly. The jacket drips onto the classroom floor. She hangs it on the hook inside her cubby labeled "SOPHIE." Her red polka-dot rain boots are muddy and wet — she pulls them off, revealing slightly damp white heart-print socks. She places the boots on the cubby floor. She changes back into her velcro sneakers from the backpack, pressing the straps firmly. Her pink-and-white striped leggings are damp and splattered from puddle jumping. Her cheeks are flushed bright pink from the cold outdoor air, and her messy ponytail has half-fallen out of its purple hair tie, light brown wisps sticking to her sweaty forehead. She looks exhilarated and slightly disheveled.

### Scene 069: Story Time — Bean Bag Corner
**Time:** 10:45 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, reading corner
**Description:** Sophie is curled up in the big red bean bag chair in the reading corner, knees drawn up, leaning to one side. Mrs. Chen sits in a low wooden rocking chair beside the bookshelf, holding up a large picture book about a bear who lost his hat. The colorful illustrations face the children — about eight kindergarteners sit on bean bags or on the alphabet rug nearby, all looking at the book. Sophie's hazel eyes are wide, fixed on the illustrations, mouth slightly open in concentration. Her small hands grip the edge of the bean bag. Her light brown hair is mostly out of its ponytail now, falling around her face. The low bookshelf beside the reading corner holds picture books with their covers facing out — bright colors and large titles. The fish tank bubbles softly on the counter nearby, two small orange goldfish swimming in slow circles.

### Scene 070: Story Time — Reaction
**Time:** 10:50 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, reading corner close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's face reacting to the story. Her hazel eyes are enormous, eyebrows raised high, mouth in a perfect round "O" of surprise — the bear in the story just found his hat on a rabbit's head. She clutches the edge of the red bean bag with both small hands, body leaning forward. A child beside her on the green bean bag mirrors the surprised expression. Mrs. Chen's hands hold the picture book open, the colorful illustration of a bear facing a guilty-looking rabbit visible. Sophie's light brown hair hangs loose around her round face — the ponytail completely fallen out, the purple hair tie now just a bracelet on her wrist. Her teal rainbow t-shirt is slightly wrinkled. The classroom reading corner shelves and warm lighting create a cozy background.

### Scene 071: Finger Painting
**Time:** 11:00 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, art area
**Description:** Sophie stands at the art table, which is covered in layers of old newspaper. She wears a large adult-sized button-up shirt backwards as an art smock — the sleeves rolled up multiple times, the shirt hanging to her knees. In front of her is a large sheet of white paper on the newspaper. Three small jars of finger paint — red, blue, and yellow — are open, their lids set aside. Sophie dips her right hand directly into the blue finger paint, her small fingers scooping up a glob of thick, cool paint. She presses her hand onto the paper, leaving a bright blue handprint. Her hazel eyes focus on the print, examining the lines of her palm reproduced in blue. A classmate beside her has already made red handprints. Sophie's left hand rests on the table edge, already smeared with yellow paint from a previous attempt. Paint dots her art smock and one cheek.

### Scene 072: Mixing Colors
**Time:** 11:05 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, art area close-up
**Description:** Sophie swirls her paint-covered fingers on the paper, mixing blue and yellow paint together. Her eyes widen as the colors blend and create green — magic happening right under her fingertips. She gasps, looking up at Mrs. Chen with her mouth open: "It turned green!" Her small fingers continue swirling, creating a messy spiral of blue, yellow, and newly discovered green. Red paint from a previous handprint mixes at the edge, creating a brownish area. The paper is now a riot of color — handprints, swirls, finger lines, and blobs. Sophie's hands are covered in paint up to her wrists — blue, yellow, and green mixing on her skin. Paint is on her art smock, her cheek, and somehow on the tip of her nose. The newspaper beneath is spattered with drips.

### Scene 073: Washing Paint Off Hands
**Time:** 11:10 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, hand-washing station
**Description:** Sophie stands at the small classroom hand-washing station — a low sink at child height with a gooseneck faucet. She holds her paint-covered hands under the running water, blue and yellow and green paint swirling off her skin and into the drain in a colorful spiral. She rubs her hands together, creating a brownish-purple lather from all the colors mixing. A pump dispenser of pink liquid hand soap sits on the sink edge. Paper towels in a wall-mounted dispenser are nearby. The art smock is still on, now spotted with paint. The paint on her cheek and nose has not been addressed yet. Another child waits behind her, hands equally colorful. Sophie scrubs her fingers individually, watching the paint water change colors as it runs — a mini art project at the sink.

### Scene 074: Toy Kitchen Play
**Time:** 11:20 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, dramatic play area
**Description:** Sophie stands at the toy kitchen in the dramatic play area of the classroom. The play kitchen is child-sized, painted white with pink accents — a small oven with a door that opens, a stovetop with plastic burner knobs, a sink with a pretend faucet, and upper cabinets. Sophie holds a small plastic frying pan and pretends to flip a plastic fried egg on the stovetop. Beside her on the counter, plastic food items are scattered — a plastic banana, a red apple, a slice of bread, a piece of cheese, a carrot. A tiny plastic plate and cup sit on the counter. Sophie wears a play apron over her teal rainbow t-shirt — the apron is child-sized, white with red polka dots. Her hair is completely loose now, light brown strands around her face. She tilts the pan with a dramatic flair, mouth pursed as if concentrating on her cooking. A toy cash register sits on a shelf nearby.

### Scene 075: Setting the Play Table
**Time:** 11:25 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, dramatic play area
**Description:** Sophie carries small plastic plates from the toy kitchen to a small table nearby, setting places for an imaginary meal. She places a blue plastic plate, a pink plastic plate, and a yellow plastic plate around the table. She adds plastic forks and spoons beside each plate — holding them in a fistful and distributing them unevenly. A plastic cup goes at each setting. She places the plastic fried egg on the blue plate, a plastic banana on the pink plate, and a plastic piece of cheese on the yellow plate. A classmate — a boy in a green striped shirt — sits in one of the tiny chairs, waiting to be served. Sophie gestures at the table with a flourish, announcing "Dinner is served!" in her high 5-year-old voice. Her play apron is coming untied in the back.

## PART 7: LUNCH & QUIET TIME (12:00 PM - 1:30 PM)

### Scene 076: Lunchbox from Cubby
**Time:** 12:00 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, cubby area
**Description:** Sophie retrieves her lunchbox from her pink cat-face backpack in the cubby labeled "SOPHIE." The lunchbox is soft-sided, lavender purple with a unicorn print on the front — a white unicorn with a rainbow mane and a gold horn. She carries it with both hands to the small round table, her velcro sneakers padding across the classroom floor. Her hair is completely down now, light brown and slightly tangled from the morning's activities. The art smock has been removed and hung on a hook, revealing her teal rainbow t-shirt with its small apple juice stain. Other children file to the tables with their own lunchboxes — a dinosaur one, a ladybug one, a superhero one. Mrs. Chen helps a child open a thermos at another table.

### Scene 077: Opening the Lunchbox
**Time:** 12:02 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the small round table in her tiny red chair and unzips her lavender unicorn lunchbox, pulling the top flap open. Inside, Kate has packed lunch in small containers — a blue lidded container with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich cut into triangles, a small green container with baby carrots and ranch dip, a clear container with red grapes, and a pink reusable water bottle with a straw top. A small folded napkin is tucked in the side. Sophie's hazel eyes survey the contents. She pulls out the blue container first, struggling with the snap-lid — her small fingers pry at the edge until it pops open, revealing the PB&J triangles with the purple grape jelly visible at the bread's edge. The sandwich bread is whole wheat, light brown.

### Scene 078: Eating PB&J
**Time:** 12:05 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at table close-up
**Description:** Sophie picks up a PB&J sandwich triangle and takes a big bite, her jaw working as she chews the sticky peanut butter. A small dab of grape jelly squeezes out the side of the sandwich and drops onto her chin. She chews with her mouth slightly open — a 5-year-old's table manners still in development. Her gap where the missing front tooth was makes the bite mark in the sandwich distinctive — a small gap in the semi-circle of teeth marks. The second triangle waits in the blue container. She holds the sandwich in her right hand, left hand flat on the table. Across the table, two classmates eat their own lunches — one has a ham sandwich, the other scoops yogurt from a container. The napkin from the lunchbox is tucked into the neckline of Sophie's t-shirt, bib-style.

### Scene 079: Carrots and Ranch
**Time:** 12:10 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at table
**Description:** Sophie opens the small green container of baby carrots and ranch dip. The orange baby carrots are lined up on one side, and a small compartment holds a dollop of white ranch dressing. She picks up a baby carrot, dips the end into the ranch, and crunches into it. The carrot snaps loudly. She chews, making an exaggerated crunching face. She dips the next carrot too deep — ranch dressing covers half the carrot and drips onto the table. She eats it anyway, ranch on her fingers. The PB&J container is empty except for crust remnants — she left the crusts. The grape container is still unopened. Her pink water bottle sits uncapped, the straw pointing toward her.

### Scene 080: Drinking Water
**Time:** 12:15 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at table
**Description:** Sophie lifts her pink reusable water bottle with both hands and drinks through the built-in straw. The water level drops visibly as she takes a long sip. She sets the bottle down with a satisfied exhale. Water droplets are on her chin, joining the jelly and ranch residue already there. She opens the clear container of red grapes and picks them up one by one, popping each into her mouth like small candy. She squishes each grape between her back teeth, juice bursting. She counts the grapes as she eats them — "one, two, free, four, five, six" — losing count after seven and starting over. The napkin bib has caught several crumbs and a grape that bounced off her chin. The lunch table is a mess of containers, crumbs, and carrot ends.

### Scene 081: Cleaning Up Lunch
**Time:** 12:20 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at table and trash can
**Description:** Sophie pulls the napkin from her collar and wipes her mouth, smearing jelly and ranch across her cheek rather than cleaning it properly. She snaps the lids back onto the empty containers — struggling with each one — and tucks them back into the lavender unicorn lunchbox. She carries the lunchbox back to her cubby, placing it inside her pink cat-face backpack. The sandwich crusts go into the classroom compost bin — a small green bin labeled "COMPOST" with pictures of banana peels and apple cores. She washes her hands at the classroom sink, the water turning orange from carrot and jelly residue. Mrs. Chen hands her a wet paper towel for her face, gently wiping the jelly smear from her cheek. Sophie squirms but allows it.

### Scene 082: Rest Time — Setting Up Mat
**Time:** 12:30 PM — dimmed classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, open floor area
**Description:** The classroom lights have been dimmed for rest time. Mrs. Chen has drawn the window blinds partially closed. Sophie pulls a small blue folding rest mat from a stack against the wall and carries it to her assigned spot on the floor. She unfolds the mat with a snap, the blue vinyl surface catching the low light. She places it on the floor between two other children's mats — careful to line it up. From her cubby, she retrieves a small fleece blanket — light purple with white stars, matching her pajamas at home — and a tiny stuffed bear from her backpack. She settles onto the mat on her side, pulling the blanket up to her chin, hugging the small bear against her chest. Her velcro sneakers have been kicked off beside the mat. Soft classical music plays from a small speaker on Mrs. Chen's desk.

### Scene 083: Resting on Mat
**Time:** 12:40 PM — dimmed classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, close-up on mat
**Description:** Sophie lies on her blue rest mat, the purple star blanket pulled up to her neck. Her light brown hair fans out messily behind her head on the mat — no pillow, just the thin vinyl. She hugs the small stuffed bear against her chest, its fuzzy head poking above the blanket. Her hazel eyes are half-closed, blinking slowly, not quite sleeping but drowsy. Her socked feet — white with pink hearts — poke out from the bottom of the blanket. Soft music plays. The dimmed classroom is peaceful — rows of small rest mats with children in various states of actual rest, some fidgeting, some genuinely asleep. The alphabet banner is barely visible in the low light. The fish tank's blue-green glow provides a soft ambient light from the counter. Sophie's eyes close.

### Scene 084: Waking from Rest
**Time:** 1:15 PM — brightening classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, on mat
**Description:** Mrs. Chen has turned the classroom lights back up gradually. Sophie blinks awake on her blue rest mat, sitting up slowly and rubbing her eyes with her fists. Her light brown hair is pressed flat on one side, sticking up on the other. The purple star blanket is tangled around her legs. The small stuffed bear has fallen beside the mat. She yawns widely, showing her gap where the front tooth is missing. Other children around her are stirring — sitting up, stretching, whispering. She folds the blanket sloppily, wrapping it around the stuffed bear, and carries both back to her cubby. She slides her feet back into the velcro sneakers beside the mat, pressing the straps down. She helps fold her rest mat, the blue vinyl creasing as she pushes it together.

## PART 8: KINDERGARTEN AFTERNOON (1:30 PM - 2:30 PM)

### Scene 085: Lining Up for Water Fountain
**Time:** 1:25 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, hallway door area
**Description:** Sophie stands in a short line of kindergarteners at the classroom door, waiting for her turn at the hallway water fountain. She bounces on her velcro sneakers, hands clasped behind her back. Her teal rainbow t-shirt is wrinkled from rest time. Her light brown hair is messy and flattened on one side from the nap mat. The child in front of her — a girl with black pigtails and a pink sweater — finishes drinking and steps aside. Sophie steps up to the silver metal water fountain mounted low on the hallway wall. She pushes the chrome button with her palm, the arc of water rising. She leans forward and drinks, water splashing her chin. Her hazel eyes are wide and refreshed. Mrs. Chen stands at the classroom door, monitoring the line. The school hallway has student artwork displayed on the walls — finger paintings and paper plate crafts.

### Scene 086: Number Bingo
**Time:** 1:35 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the small round table with a laminated number bingo card in front of her and a handful of small plastic discs — red, translucent — as markers. Mrs. Chen holds up a card with the number 7 written large. Sophie scans her bingo card, her finger hovering over each square. She finds the 7 in the bottom row and presses a red disc onto it with her thumb, a look of satisfaction on her round face. Her bingo card already has three discs on it. The child across the table puts a disc on his card too. Sophie's light brown hair, still messy from rest time, hangs loose around her face. Her hazel eyes are bright and alert after the nap. The classroom is animated again — lights fully on, children's voices filling the room. A laminated number chart (1-20) hangs on the wall nearby.

### Scene 087: Building with Blocks
**Time:** 1:45 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, block area on floor
**Description:** Sophie sits on the colorful alphabet rug on the classroom floor with a pile of large wooden unit blocks — rectangular, triangular, cylindrical, and arched shapes in natural wood finish. She carefully stacks blocks to build a tower, placing each one with precise concentration. Her tower is five blocks high — she adds a sixth, a triangular piece as a roof, balancing it carefully. Her tongue pokes out as she steadies the top block. The tower wobbles but holds. She clasps her hands together in delight, then reaches for a cylindrical block to add a chimney. A classmate builds a wall of blocks nearby, their two constructions nearly touching. The wooden blocks make solid clunking sounds on the rug. Sophie's teal rainbow t-shirt and striped leggings are visible as she sits cross-legged. The toy kitchen area is visible in the background.

### Scene 088: Block Tower Falls
**Time:** 1:48 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, block area
**Description:** Sophie's block tower has toppled — blocks scattered across the alphabet rug. She sits amidst the wooden debris, mouth in a small "O" of surprise, hazel eyes wide. The cylindrical chimney block rolled to the edge of the rug. The triangular roof block lies upside down. Her classmate's wall was knocked over too by the cascade. For a moment Sophie looks dismayed, lower lip jutting out. Then she laughs, picks up the first rectangular block, and starts rebuilding. "I'm gonna make it even bigger!" she announces. Her light brown hair swings forward as she leans to collect the scattered blocks. Mrs. Chen watches from nearby, giving an encouraging nod. The large wooden blocks make satisfying sounds as Sophie clacks them together.

### Scene 089: Show and Tell
**Time:** 2:00 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, circle on rug
**Description:** Sophie stands in front of the class on the ABC rug, holding up a small plastic container. Inside the container, visible through the clear walls, is a clump of golden hamster fur — Biscuit's shed fur that Sophie collected. She holds it high for the circle of seated classmates to see, talking excitedly about Biscuit. "This is my hamster's fur! His name is Biscuit and he's golden and he runs on his wheel at night!" Her small hands gesture enthusiastically, nearly dropping the container. Her hazel eyes are bright with excitement, gap-toothed grin wide. Mrs. Chen sits in the rocking chair, smiling. The other children lean forward, fascinated. Sophie shows how Biscuit puffs his cheeks by puffing her own cheeks out and holding her hands like tiny paws in front of her face, imitating the hamster. The class laughs.

### Scene 090: Goodbye Song
**Time:** 2:20 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, circle on rug
**Description:** Sophie sits cross-legged on the ABC rug with her classmates for the end-of-day goodbye song. Mrs. Chen leads from the rocking chair, clapping a rhythm. The children sing and clap along — Sophie claps off-beat, her small hands making soft pats. She sways side to side with the melody, her loose light brown hair swishing. Her teal rainbow t-shirt is wrinkled and has faint paint smudges on the sleeve from the morning's art. She sings the words, mouth exaggerating each syllable. The calendar wall behind them shows the day's activities all checked off with magnets. The weather chart still shows the rain cloud. Through the large windows, the Portland sky has shifted to a lighter gray, the rain having stopped. Sophie's hazel eyes crinkle with her singing smile.

### Scene 091: Getting Ready to Go Home
**Time:** 2:25 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, cubby area
**Description:** Sophie is at her cubby, pulling on her yellow rain jacket even though the rain has stopped — mom's rule. She zips it up, stuffs her feet back into her red polka-dot rain boots over her sneakers, and grabs her pink cat-face backpack. The lavender unicorn lunchbox is inside, along with the purple star blanket and small stuffed bear. Her caterpillar art project — now dry — is carefully rolled up and placed on top. She slings one backpack strap over her shoulder, the backpack drooping to one side. Her hair is completely loose and tangled from the full day. Her face has a faint smudge of blue paint near her ear from the finger painting that the wet paper towel missed. She waves goodbye to Mrs. Chen, who stands at the classroom door. "Bye Mrs. Chen! Bye fishies!" she calls to the goldfish tank.

## PART 9: AFTER SCHOOL — MOM PICKUP & ERRANDS (2:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Scene 092: Mom at Pickup
**Time:** 2:30 PM — overcast, no rain
**Setting:** School entrance/pickup zone
**Description:** Sophie bursts through the school's front doors, eyes scanning the pickup area for Kate. Her yellow rain jacket is unzipped, flapping open. Her pink cat-face backpack bounces on her back. She spots Kate standing beside the dark blue Subaru Outback in the pickup line, waving. Kate wears her olive green rain jacket and jeans, brown hair in its bun. Sophie runs toward her — red polka-dot rain boots stomping on the wet sidewalk — arms outstretched. She crashes into Kate's legs in a full-body hug, wrapping her small arms around Kate's thighs. Kate laughs, bending down to hug her back. Other parents and children mill around the pickup zone. The school's colorful mural is visible on the building wall. The American flag hangs damp overhead. Portland's green trees drip in the background.

### Scene 093: Getting Into the Car
**Time:** 2:33 PM — overcast
**Setting:** Back seat of Subaru Outback
**Description:** Sophie climbs into the back seat of the Subaru and into her booster car seat. Kate takes her pink cat-face backpack and places it on the opposite seat. Sophie chatters nonstop about her day — "We did finger painting and I made GREEN, Mom! Blue and yellow make GREEN!" — her small hands gesturing animatedly as Kate buckles the five-point harness. Her yellow rain jacket bunches around the straps. Her red rain boots dangle below the booster seat. Kate clicks the chest clip and tightens the straps. She asks about the paint smudge on Sophie's ear, licking her thumb and wiping it — Sophie squirms and protests. A children's song starts playing softly on the car's radio. Kate closes the door and walks to the driver's side.

### Scene 094: Grocery Store Arrival
**Time:** 2:50 PM — overcast
**Setting:** Grocery store parking lot
**Description:** The dark blue Subaru Outback is parked in a grocery store parking lot. Kate unbuckles Sophie from her booster seat and lifts her out onto the wet asphalt. The grocery store is a local Portland co-op with a green awning and wooden sign. Kate pulls a reusable canvas grocery bag — the Portland farmer's market one — from the trunk. She holds Sophie's hand as they walk toward the entrance. Sophie skips beside her in her red polka-dot rain boots, yellow rain jacket hood down. A row of metal shopping carts is visible under the awning. Potted plants and bags of soil are displayed outside the entrance. A chalkboard sign by the door advertises "Local Organic Apples — $2.99/lb." Sophie looks up at Kate, asking if they can get strawberries.

### Scene 095: Grocery Store — Riding the Cart
**Time:** 2:55 PM — bright store lighting
**Setting:** Inside grocery store, produce section
**Description:** Sophie stands in the front of a silver metal shopping cart, feet on the bottom bar, hands gripping the sides of the child seat area. She is not sitting in the child seat but standing in the larger basket area of the cart — she is getting too big for the flip-down seat. Kate pushes the cart slowly through the produce section. Displays of colorful fruits and vegetables surround them — bright red apples in wooden crates, green bunches of bananas, purple grapes in plastic clamshells, orange carrots with leafy green tops, heads of green lettuce. Sophie points excitedly at a display of strawberries in clear plastic containers, the red berries bright under the fluorescent store lights. Mist machines spray a fine water mist over the lettuce nearby. The reusable canvas bag hangs from the cart handle.

### Scene 096: Picking Strawberries
**Time:** 2:58 PM — bright store lighting
**Setting:** Grocery store, produce section
**Description:** Kate lifts Sophie out of the cart and lets her choose a container of strawberries from the display. Sophie carefully examines three containers, tilting each one to look at the berries from different angles — a serious inspection. She selects the one with the biggest, reddest berries and holds it up triumphantly. "These ones!" The clear plastic container is almost as big as her small head. Kate takes it and places it in the shopping cart. Sophie then reaches for a single banana from the bunch, but the whole bunch comes with it — six bananas connected at the stem. She holds the heavy bunch with both hands, struggling with the weight, before Kate helps place them in the cart. The produce scale hangs nearby. A store employee in a green apron restocks oranges behind them.

### Scene 097: Grocery Store — Cereal Aisle
**Time:** 3:05 PM — bright store lighting
**Setting:** Grocery store, cereal aisle
**Description:** Sophie walks beside the shopping cart down the cereal aisle, her red rain boots making small squeaking sounds on the linoleum floor. Tall shelves of cereal boxes tower above her on both sides — colorful boxes with cartoon characters, bears, birds, and tigers. She stops at a box at her eye level — a cereal with a cartoon panda on the front, bright purple box with marshmallow shapes advertised. She picks it up with both hands, turning to Kate with hopeful hazel eyes. Kate considers, then nods. Sophie does a small hop of excitement and places the box in the cart with exaggerated care. The cart already contains a jug of milk, a loaf of bread, the strawberries, bananas, and a bag of baby carrots. Kate checks her grocery list on her phone, scrolling with one hand while steering the cart with the other.

### Scene 098: Checkout Counter
**Time:** 3:15 PM — bright store lighting
**Setting:** Grocery store, checkout area
**Description:** Sophie stands on tiptoe beside the checkout counter, barely tall enough to see over the conveyor belt. She helps Kate unload the cart, lifting items one at a time and placing them on the black rubber belt — the strawberries, the bananas, a jug of milk, a loaf of whole wheat bread, baby carrots, the panda cereal box, a block of cheddar cheese, and a box of pasta. She handles each item with deliberate care, placing them on the belt. The cashier — a young woman with red hair and a green store apron — smiles at Sophie. A beeping scanner reads barcodes. Kate pulls the reusable canvas bag open for packing. Sophie picks up the plastic bag of baby carrots and tosses it onto the belt — it slides further than intended and nudges the milk jug. Behind them, another customer waits with their cart. Sophie peers at the candy display by the register but Kate gently redirects her attention.

### Scene 099: Library Arrival
**Time:** 3:35 PM — overcast, patches of light
**Setting:** Public library exterior
**Description:** The dark blue Subaru is parked outside a small Portland public library branch — a low brick building with large glass windows, a covered entrance with a book return slot, and flower beds along the front walkway. A large blue banner reads "STORYTIME SATURDAYS" on the library facade. Kate carries the canvas grocery bag — now full of groceries — while Sophie runs ahead up the concrete walkway. Sophie pushes through the heavy glass library door with both small hands, the door much larger than she is. Her yellow rain jacket is unzipped and flapping. A metal book return box stands outside the entrance. Bicycles are locked to a rack nearby. Wet leaves are scattered on the walkway from Portland's trees. A poster in the window advertises "Summer Reading Challenge" with cartoon animals reading books.

### Scene 100: Library — Browsing Picture Books
**Time:** 3:40 PM — soft library lighting
**Setting:** Public library, children's section
**Description:** Sophie stands in the children's section of the library, surrounded by low wooden bookshelves at her height. The shelves are labeled with picture icons — animals, fairy tales, science, counting. Colorful book covers face outward on display shelves. Sophie pulls a large picture book from the shelf — it has a cover illustration of a kitten tangled in yarn. She holds it with both hands, studying the cover intensely, then flips it open and looks at the pictures. Her yellow rain jacket is draped over her arm — Kate took it off at the entrance. Her light brown hair hangs loose and tangled. She sits down cross-legged on the library's soft blue carpet right there in the aisle, the book open in her lap, turning pages slowly. Kate browses a nearby shelf of adult books, keeping an eye on Sophie. A librarian at a low desk stamps books in the background.

### Scene 101: Library — Choosing Books
**Time:** 3:50 PM — soft library lighting
**Setting:** Public library, children's section
**Description:** Sophie has accumulated a small tower of picture books beside her on the blue library carpet — five books stacked precariously. She adds a sixth — a book about dinosaurs with a T-Rex on the cover. Kate kneels beside her, suggesting they can check out three — the library card limit for children's books. Sophie's face falls momentarily, then she carefully selects her three favorites: the kitten-in-yarn book, the dinosaur book, and one with a cover showing a girl and her pet hamster. "Look Mom, it's like Biscuit!" she exclaims, pointing at the hamster on the cover. Kate smiles and takes the three books. Sophie reluctantly returns the others to the shelf — placing them approximately where they came from, not quite correctly. Kate hands Sophie a small yellow library card from her wallet. The library's checkout counter with a computer is visible ahead.

### Scene 102: Library Checkout
**Time:** 3:55 PM — soft library lighting
**Setting:** Public library, checkout counter
**Description:** Sophie stands on tiptoe at the library checkout counter, sliding her small yellow library card across the wooden surface to the librarian. The librarian — an older man with gray hair and round glasses — takes the card with a warm smile. He scans each of the three picture books with a red laser scanner that beeps. Sophie watches the scanner with fascination, hazel eyes following the red light. The three books sit on the counter — the kitten yarn cover, the dinosaur, and the girl-with-hamster. The librarian stamps the inside covers with a due date in purple ink and hands the books back to Sophie. She hugs all three books against her chest, the stack almost as wide as her torso. Kate tucks the library card back into her wallet. A "READ!" poster with a cartoon owl hangs on the wall behind the counter.

---

## PART 10: PARK PLAYGROUND (4:00 PM - 4:40 PM)

### Scene 103: Walking to the Park
**Time:** 4:05 PM — overcast with bright patches
**Setting:** Portland residential sidewalk
**Description:** Sophie and Kate walk along a Portland sidewalk toward a neighborhood park. Sophie wears her yellow rain jacket unzipped, red polka-dot rain boots splashing through residual puddles. Kate carries the canvas grocery bag in one hand and holds Sophie's hand with the other. The sidewalk passes under tall Douglas fir and maple trees, their leaves dripping with leftover rain. Colorful Portland houses — Craftsman bungalows in blues, greens, and grays — line the street with covered porches and front gardens. A neighbor's orange cat sits on a porch railing, watching them pass. Sophie points at the cat, tugging Kate's hand. Ahead, a park entrance is visible — a low wooden fence with a metal gate, a wooden sign reading "Fernwood Park," and the green canopy of trees beyond. The late afternoon sky has patches of lighter gray where the sun tries to break through.

### Scene 104: Park — Running to the Playground
**Time:** 4:08 PM — overcast with bright patches
**Setting:** Neighborhood park
**Description:** Sophie breaks free from Kate's hand and runs across the wet grass toward the playground equipment, her red polka-dot rain boots leaving small prints in the soft ground. Her yellow rain jacket streams behind her, arms pumping. Her light brown hair bounces with each stride. The park playground has a wooden play structure with a green metal slide, two swings with rubber seats and chain links, a set of monkey bars, and a small spinning merry-go-round. The wood chips beneath the equipment are dark and wet from rain. A few other children play on the structure. Park benches line the path — Kate heads for one, setting down the grocery bag. Tall Douglas fir trees tower around the park perimeter, their dark green needles contrasting with the gray sky. A Portland Parks & Recreation sign is posted near the entrance.

### Scene 105: Monkey Bars Attempt
**Time:** 4:12 PM — overcast with bright patches
**Setting:** Park playground, monkey bars
**Description:** Sophie reaches up to grab the first rung of the monkey bars — the metal bars are cold and slightly damp. She hangs from the first rung with both small hands, her red rain boots dangling six inches off the wet wood chips below. Her yellow rain jacket rides up, exposing the teal rainbow t-shirt beneath. She swings her body, trying to reach the second rung — her right hand stretches forward but cannot quite reach. Her hazel eyes are determined, face scrunched with effort, gap-toothed mouth set in concentration. She hangs for three seconds, then drops to the wood chips, landing on her boots with a thud. She shakes out her small hands, the metal bars having left red indentations on her palms. She looks at Kate on the bench — Kate gives a thumbs up. Sophie jumps to try again.

### Scene 106: Swinging at the Park
**Time:** 4:18 PM — overcast, hints of sun
**Setting:** Park playground, swing set
**Description:** Sophie pumps her legs on the swing, gaining height with each forward and back motion. Her red polka-dot rain boots point at the sky on the forward swing, then tuck beneath her on the back swing. The metal chain links creak rhythmically. Her yellow rain jacket puffs with air like a small parachute. Her light brown hair streams behind her. She laughs — a high, clear 5-year-old laugh — as she swings higher. Kate sits on the park bench nearby, watching with a smile, the canvas grocery bag at her feet. A golden retriever on a leash passes on the park path behind the swings, its owner in a red rain jacket. The late afternoon light breaks through the gray clouds momentarily, casting pale golden light across the wet park. Douglas firs stand sentinel in the background, their trunks dark with moisture.

### Scene 107: Discovering a Worm
**Time:** 4:25 PM — overcast
**Setting:** Park, near the path
**Description:** Sophie squats down on the wet park path, her red rain boots planted on the gravel, knees bent, peering at something on the ground. A long pink earthworm wriggles across the path, glistening with moisture after the rain. Sophie's hazel eyes are enormous with fascination, her mouth open in an "oooh." She extends one small finger, almost touching the worm but not quite, hesitating. She looks up at Kate, who has come to see what caught Sophie's attention. "Mom, look! A worm! It's slimy!" Sophie announces with pure wonder. The worm curls into an S-shape. Wet leaves — brown, yellow, and orange — litter the path around the worm. Sophie's yellow rain jacket is muddy at the knees from squatting. The park's wet grass and Douglas fir trees frame the background.

### Scene 108: Collecting Leaves
**Time:** 4:30 PM — overcast
**Setting:** Park, under maple trees
**Description:** Sophie walks beneath a large maple tree in the park, collecting fallen leaves from the wet ground. She holds a small bouquet of leaves in her left hand — a red maple leaf, a yellow one, a brown oak leaf, and a green one that is still fresh. She bends to pick up another — a large orange maple leaf with pronounced veins — and adds it to her collection, examining it closely. Raindrops cling to the leaf surfaces like tiny glass beads. Her red polka-dot rain boots are spattered with mud. Her yellow rain jacket sleeves are pushed up to her elbows. She brings the leaf bouquet to her nose and sniffs — wrinkling her nose at the earthy, damp smell. Kate takes a photo with her phone. The park path stretches behind Sophie, lined with fallen leaves in autumn colors. A squirrel watches from a tree trunk nearby, clutching an acorn.

### Scene 109: Time to Go Home
**Time:** 4:40 PM — overcast, dimming afternoon light
**Setting:** Park path, walking to car
**Description:** Sophie walks beside Kate on the park path back toward the street where the Subaru is parked. Sophie's small hand holds Kate's two fingers. In her other hand, she clutches her bouquet of collected leaves, the stems sticking out at angles. Her yellow rain jacket is zipped up again — Kate insisted as the air cooled. Her red rain boots have mud up the sides. Her light brown hair is windblown and messy from the playground. She looks back over her shoulder at the playground one last time, then turns to Kate and asks "Can we come back tomorrow?" The park's trees and wet paths recede behind them. The late afternoon Portland sky is dimming, the gray deepening. Street lights along the path are beginning to flicker on, casting warm orange pools on the wet sidewalk.

## PART 11: EVENING AT HOME (5:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

### Scene 110: Back at the Apartment
**Time:** 5:00 PM — warm interior light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway
**Description:** Sophie and Kate enter the apartment. Sophie sits on the hallway floor, pulling off her mud-caked red polka-dot rain boots. She sets them on the shoe rack, the mud leaving smudges. She unzips her yellow rain jacket and hangs it on the low coat hook with Kate's help. Underneath, her teal rainbow t-shirt is wrinkled and has the morning's various stains — apple juice, a faint blue paint smudge. She is in her sock feet — the white heart-print socks are slightly damp. Kate carries the canvas grocery bag to the kitchen. Sophie's pink cat-face backpack gets hung on a hook. She carries her leaf bouquet carefully, looking for a place to put them. The apartment hallway is warm and welcoming after the cool outdoor air. The overhead light casts a yellow glow on the family photos on the wall.

### Scene 111: Putting Away Groceries
**Time:** 5:05 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen
**Description:** Sophie helps Kate put away groceries in the small kitchen. Sophie holds the container of strawberries, carrying it to the refrigerator. Kate opens the fridge door — inside, shelves hold milk, eggs, condiments, leftover containers, and a pitcher of water. Sophie places the strawberries on the lowest shelf, the one she can reach. Kate hands her the bunch of bananas and Sophie places them on the wooden banana hook on the counter, the yellow bananas swinging. She tries to pick up the milk jug — too heavy, it tips and Kate catches it. The panda cereal box goes in an upper cabinet that Kate opens. Sophie stands on the kitchen step stool to hand items up. The canvas grocery bag gradually empties on the counter. The kitchen window shows darkening Portland sky.

### Scene 112: Leaf Art Project
**Time:** 5:15 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the small round kitchen table on her blue booster cushion, her collected park leaves spread out on the table surface. She has retrieved a glue stick and a sheet of white paper from a small art supply basket on the kitchen counter. She peels a damp red maple leaf off the table and carefully glue-sticks the back, pressing it onto the paper. The leaf's veins and edges print through — she presses it flat with her small palm. A yellow leaf goes next, overlapping the red one slightly. She is making a leaf collage. Glue smears the table surface. The leaf bouquet — orange, green, brown, and more red — waits in a pile. Her small tongue pokes out as she concentrates. Kate works at the counter behind her, starting dinner preparation. A pot sits on the stove. The overhead kitchen light illuminates the leaf project warmly.

### Scene 113: Sophie Watches Mom Cook
**Time:** 5:30 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at the counter
**Description:** Sophie stands on the white kitchen step stool beside Kate at the counter, watching her mom chop vegetables for dinner. Kate cuts orange carrots into rounds on a wooden cutting board, a sharp knife in her hand. Sophie watches the knife with wide hazel eyes from a safe distance. A pot of water simmers on the electric stove behind them, small bubbles forming. On the counter: a box of pasta, a jar of red marinara sauce, a head of green broccoli, and a block of yellow cheddar cheese. Sophie picks up a raw carrot round from the cutting board and nibbles on it. Kate pretends to not notice, hiding a smile. The kitchen window above the sink shows darkening sky, a streetlight visible through the rain-dotted glass. Sophie's leaf collage dries on the table behind them, weighed down with a salt shaker.

### Scene 114: Setting the Table
**Time:** 5:45 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Sophie carries a plate from the kitchen counter to the small round table — a white ceramic plate with a blue rim, held carefully in both small hands. She places it at Kate's spot. Then she gets her own plate — a smaller purple plastic plate with a wide rim. She places it at her spot on the booster cushion. She goes back for utensils — grabbing a handful of forks and spoons from the drawer and distributing them approximately correctly. A fork for Mom, a fork for Sophie. She adds paper napkins from a holder on the counter, folded in half. Two glasses go on the table — Kate's regular glass and Sophie's purple plastic cup. She stands back, surveying the two place settings, and adjusts a napkin that is overlapping a plate. The leaf collage has been moved to the counter to make room. Dinner smells — pasta and marinara — fill the kitchen.

### Scene 115: Dinner Together
**Time:** 6:00 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Sophie and Kate sit at the small round kitchen table eating dinner. Sophie's purple plastic plate holds a small portion of pasta with red marinara sauce, steamed broccoli florets, and grated yellow cheddar cheese sprinkled on top. She twirls pasta around her fork — not very successfully, the noodles slipping off — and brings a messy forkful to her mouth. Sauce smears her chin. Kate eats across the table, her own plate holding a larger portion of the same meal. Sophie's purple cup holds milk. Kate's glass holds water. The overhead light creates a warm, intimate pool of light over the small table. Through the kitchen window, Portland's evening is dark, streetlights and the glow of neighboring apartment windows visible. Sophie kicks her dangling sock feet under the table as she eats. The pot and pan from cooking sit on the stove behind them.

### Scene 116: Broccoli Negotiation
**Time:** 6:10 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, close-up at table
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's purple plate showing the remaining food — the pasta is mostly gone, the cheese scraped up, but three broccoli florets remain untouched, pushed to the far edge of the plate. Sophie sits with her arms crossed over her teal rainbow t-shirt, mouth set in a stubborn line, looking at the broccoli with suspicion. Kate's hand is visible, pointing at the broccoli. Sophie picks up one floret between her thumb and forefinger, holding it at arm's length, nose wrinkled. She takes the tiniest possible bite of the broccoli top, chewing with exaggerated reluctance, face scrunched. She washes it down immediately with a gulp from her purple milk cup. Two broccoli florets remain. Kate raises an eyebrow. Sophie sighs dramatically and picks up the second one.

### Scene 117: Clearing Dinner Dishes
**Time:** 6:20 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Sophie carries her purple plastic plate to the kitchen sink, standing on the step stool to reach. The plate has a smear of red marinara sauce and one remaining broccoli floret — she ate two out of three, a compromise. She places the plate in the sink carefully. Kate stands beside her, rinsing dishes under the running faucet. Sophie picks up the small sponge from the sink edge and attempts to wash her own plate, squeezing dish soap on it — way too much, a mountain of green suds erupts. She giggles at the excessive bubbles, blowing on them and sending a few floating into the air. Kate takes the sponge gently and shows her how much soap to use. Sophie's sock feet grip the step stool. The kitchen window reflects their warm interior scene against the dark Portland night outside.

### Scene 118: Checking on Biscuit — Evening
**Time:** 6:30 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the dresser
**Description:** Sophie pads into her bedroom in her sock feet and goes straight to Biscuit's cage on the white dresser. The bedroom lamp is on — a small lamp with a shade decorated with butterflies, casting warm light. Biscuit is fully awake and active now that it is evening — hamsters are crepuscular. The golden hamster is running on his silver exercise wheel, tiny pink feet pattering rapidly, the wheel making a soft spinning sound. Sophie presses her face to the cage bars, giggling as she watches him run. "He's running so fast, Mom!" she calls. The ceramic food bowl is nearly empty from the morning's feeding. The water bottle is half-drained. Wood shavings are scattered around the cage from Biscuit's burrowing. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling are beginning to appear faintly as the room darkens outside the lamp's glow.

### Scene 119: Feeding Biscuit — Evening
**Time:** 6:33 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the dresser
**Description:** Sophie opens the cage door carefully and refills Biscuit's ceramic food bowl with pellets from the paper bag on the dresser. Kate watches from the doorway. Sophie counts the pellets as she drops them in: "one, two, free, four, five, six, seven." Biscuit has stopped running on his wheel and waddles over to the food bowl, his golden fur slightly ruffled. He sniffs the fresh pellets, selects one, and begins nibbling, holding it in his tiny paws. Sophie reaches for the container of sunflower seed treats and drops two seeds into the cage as a special treat. Biscuit immediately stuffs both into his cheek pouches, his face ballooning on both sides. Sophie laughs so hard she snorts, pressing her hand over her mouth. The cage is warm and cozy in the lamplight.

### Scene 120: Giving Biscuit a Treat
**Time:** 6:35 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up at cage
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's small fingers holding a single sunflower seed through the cage bars. Biscuit the golden hamster approaches cautiously, round black eyes fixed on the seed, pink nose twitching, whiskers quivering. He reaches out with his tiny paws, delicately taking the seed from Sophie's fingertips. His paws brush her finger — tiny, warm, soft. Sophie holds perfectly still, barely breathing, hazel eyes enormous with wonder and concentration. Biscuit sits back on his haunches and begins shelling the seed with his teeth, a rapid clicking sound. The silver exercise wheel is behind him. Wood shavings cling to his golden fur. Sophie's face is inches from the cage bars, the warm lamp light illuminating the fine details — each wire of the cage, each strand of hamster fur, each freckle beginning to appear on Sophie's nose.

## PART 12: BATH TIME & BEDTIME (7:00 PM - 8:00 PM)

### Scene 121: Getting Ready for Bath
**Time:** 7:00 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom
**Description:** Kate turns on the bathtub faucet in the apartment bathroom, testing the water temperature with her hand. Water gushes from the chrome faucet into the white bathtub, steam rising gently. She squeezes a stream of bubble bath liquid from a blue bottle into the running water — pink-tinted bubbles begin to foam and multiply. The light blue fish-print shower curtain is pushed to one side. On the tub edge sit bath toys — a yellow rubber duck and a pink rubber duck, a small blue plastic boat, and three stacking cups in primary colors. Sophie stands in the bathroom doorway in her teal rainbow t-shirt and striped leggings, watching the bubbles grow with anticipation. Her green frog towel is already hung on the low hook, ready. The white step stool is pushed against the wall. The bright overhead light illuminates the white subway tiles and gray floor.

### Scene 122: Bubble Bath — Wrapped in Towel After
**Time:** 7:15 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom
**Description:** Sophie stands on the gray tile bathroom floor wrapped in her green hooded frog towel from head to toe. The frog hood sits on her head — two round frog eyes above her forehead — and the green terrycloth towel drapes around her small body like a robe, reaching her ankles. Her face peeks out from the towel, rosy-cheeked and damp, light brown hair wet and darkened to a deeper brown, plastered to her forehead and neck. She grins her gap-toothed grin. Behind her, the bathtub has a ring of foam residue and the bath toys — rubber ducks and blue boat — float in the remaining shallow water. A few bubbles cling to the tub edge. Kate kneels beside her, rubbing the towel gently over Sophie's wet hair through the hood. Small wet footprints mark the gray tile floor from tub to where Sophie stands.

### Scene 123: Hair Drying
**Time:** 7:18 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom, at the sink
**Description:** Kate rubs Sophie's wet hair gently with a small white hand towel, the light brown strands darkened and stringy from the bath. Sophie sits on the closed toilet lid — the blue potty seat adapter removed — swinging her small bare feet, which peek out from beneath the green frog towel still wrapped around her. Kate works section by section, squeezing excess water from the ends. Sophie's eyes are half-closed, enjoying the gentle sensation. The frog towel hood has slipped back, revealing her damp hair. A wide-tooth pink comb sits on the sink edge, ready for detangling. The bathroom mirror is fogged from bath steam. The blue bubble bath bottle and rubber ducks are visible on the tub edge. The white subway tiles gleam under the bright light.

### Scene 124: Combing Wet Hair
**Time:** 7:20 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom, sitting on toilet lid
**Description:** Kate gently combs through Sophie's damp light brown hair with the wide-tooth pink comb, starting from the ends and working upward. Sophie winces when the comb catches a small tangle behind her ear, her round face scrunching. Kate holds the hair above the tangle to reduce pulling, murmuring "almost done." The damp hair separates into smooth strands as the comb passes through. Sophie grips the edge of the toilet lid with both hands, enduring the combing patiently. The green frog towel is still wrapped around her body. A few strands of light brown hair cling to the comb's teeth. The bathroom mirror has cleared slightly, showing a foggy reflection. Small wet footprints are still visible on the gray tile floor.

### Scene 125: Putting On Pajamas
**Time:** 7:23 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom
**Description:** Sophie stands in her bedroom beside the twin bed, pulling on her light purple pajama top with white stars printed all over it. Her arms push through the sleeves, the top slightly too big, sleeves extending past her wrists. She is already wearing the matching purple star pajama bottoms. Her light brown hair is damp and hanging loose around her shoulders — no ponytail for bedtime. Her face is scrubbed pink from the bath. She tugs the pajama top down over her small torso. Kate stands by the dresser, hanging the green frog towel over the bedroom door to dry. The bedroom lamp is on, casting warm golden light. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling are starting to glow faintly. Biscuit's cage is visible on the dresser — the hamster is running on his wheel again, a blur of golden fur.

### Scene 126: Brushing Teeth — Evening
**Time:** 7:28 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Apartment bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Sophie stands on the white step stool at the bathroom sink in her light purple star pajamas, brushing her teeth for the second time today. She holds the purple kids' toothbrush in her fist, scrubbing back and forth. Bubblegum toothpaste foam forms around her mouth. Her damp light brown hair hangs loose around her face. She watches her reflection in the round mirror — a small girl in purple star pajamas, gap-toothed, rosy-cheeked, standing on a step stool. She spits into the sink, rinses with water cupped in her hand, and places the toothbrush back in the frog-shaped holder. She grins at her reflection, checking her teeth — the gap where the missing tooth was is visible. She hops off the step stool, the bathroom floor cool under her bare feet — she is not wearing socks or slippers, just bare toes on the gray tile.

### Scene 127: Saying Goodnight to Biscuit
**Time:** 7:35 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the dresser
**Description:** Sophie stands at the dresser in her purple star pajamas, leaning close to Biscuit's cage for the nightly ritual. The golden hamster has paused on his exercise wheel, one tiny paw raised, looking at Sophie with his round black eyes. Sophie whispers "Goodnight, Biscuit. I love you." through the cage bars. She gently taps the cage with her fingertip, and Biscuit's pink nose twitches in response. The cage is warm in the lamplight — fresh bedding, food bowl refilled, water bottle half-full. The silver exercise wheel gleams. Sophie covers the cage with a light cloth — a purple handkerchief — that Kate has taught her to drape over the top to help Biscuit know it is nighttime. She pats the cloth into place carefully. The crayon drawing of "BISKIT" on the wall above is visible in the warm light.

### Scene 128: Choosing a Bedtime Book
**Time:** 7:38 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the bookshelf
**Description:** Sophie kneels on the lavender rug in front of the small white bookshelf, scanning the picture books. Her bare feet tuck beneath her in the purple star pajamas. She runs her small finger along the colorful spines — books about kittens, dinosaurs, the moon, a hungry caterpillar, a bear looking for his hat. She pulls out the new library book — the one about the girl and her pet hamster — and holds it up to Kate with both hands. "This one! The hamster one!" Kate sits on the edge of Sophie's twin bed, patting the spot beside her. The three library books are stacked on the bookshelf's top, the dinosaur and kitten-yarn books waiting for future nights. The moon-shaped nightlight has been turned on, its amber glow warming the corner near the bed. The purple star bedding is pulled down, ready.

### Scene 129: Climbing Into Bed
**Time:** 7:40 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the bed
**Description:** Sophie climbs into her twin bed, swinging her small bare feet over the purple guardrail and sliding under the purple star comforter. She settles against the white pillow, pulling the comforter up to her chin. Her damp light brown hair fans across the pillow. She reaches for her stuffed bunny with the floppy ears, tucking it under her arm. The plush giraffe is already on the pillow. Kate settles beside her on the edge of the bed, the mattress dipping under her weight. The hamster book rests in Kate's lap. The bedroom lamp casts a warm circle of light on the bed. Beyond the lamp's reach, the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling are now clearly visible — pale green dots scattered across the ceiling in random constellation patterns. The moon-shaped nightlight glows amber near the floor. Rain has resumed outside, tapping gently on the window.

### Scene 130: Bedtime Story — Reading Together
**Time:** 7:42 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Kate holds the hamster picture book open so Sophie can see the illustrations. The book shows a colorful drawing of a girl feeding her hamster — similar to Sophie and Biscuit. Sophie points at the hamster in the illustration with her small finger, whispering "That looks like Biscuit." Kate reads aloud, her voice soft and rhythmic. Sophie's hazel eyes track back and forth between the pictures and Kate's face. Her stuffed bunny is wedged under her arm, its floppy ear draped across the open book. The purple star comforter is pulled up to Sophie's chest. The bedroom is peaceful — warm lamp light, the soft sound of rain outside, Kate's quiet reading voice, and the gentle spinning of Biscuit's exercise wheel from behind the draped cloth on the cage. The glow-in-the-dark stars are bright on the ceiling above.

### Scene 131: Bedtime Story — Sleepy Eyes
**Time:** 7:50 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, close-up in bed
**Description:** Close-up of Sophie's face on the white pillow. Her hazel eyes are heavy-lidded, blinking slowly, fighting sleep. Her light brown hair is spread across the pillow in damp strands. Her rosy cheeks are relaxed, mouth slightly open. The stuffed bunny is pressed against her cheek, its floppy ear across her nose. Kate's hand is visible at the edge of the frame, still holding the open book, though her voice has slowed to a near whisper. Sophie's small hand rests palm-up on the comforter, fingers loosely curled. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling reflect in her half-open eyes — tiny green dots in the hazel. Her breathing has slowed to the deep, even rhythm of a child on the edge of sleep. A yawn escapes, wide and unguarded, showing the gap where her front tooth used to be.

### Scene 132: Goodnight Kiss
**Time:** 7:55 PM — dim bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the bed
**Description:** Kate leans down and places a gentle kiss on Sophie's forehead. Sophie's eyes are barely open, drowsy slits of hazel. She mumbles "Night night, Mama" in a sleepy voice, her words slightly slurred. Kate whispers "Goodnight, sweetpea. I love you." She tucks the purple star comforter snugly around Sophie's small body, making sure the stuffed bunny is within arm's reach. She brushes a strand of damp light brown hair off Sophie's forehead. The plush giraffe is wedged between Sophie and the purple bed guardrail. Kate stands, reaches for the bedside lamp, and clicks it off. The room dims to the warm amber glow of the moon-shaped nightlight and the pale green constellation of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. Rain whispers against the window.

### Scene 133: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 8:00 PM — moon nightlight glow
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, wide view
**Description:** Sophie's bedroom is quiet and dim, lit only by the amber moon-shaped nightlight near the floor and the faint glow-in-the-dark stars scattered across the ceiling. Sophie lies in her twin bed under the purple star comforter, eyes closed, face peaceful, small chest rising and falling with deep, even breaths. Her light brown hair spreads across the white pillow. The stuffed bunny is tucked under her chin, the plush giraffe against the guardrail. On the dresser, Biscuit's cage is draped with the purple cloth, though the faint sound of his exercise wheel spinning softly continues — a gentle, rhythmic lullaby. The wooden toy chest with its rainbow is a dark shape against the wall. The white bookshelf holds its collection of picture books in shadow. Outside the window, Portland rain falls steadily, a soothing patter against the glass. The door is ajar, a sliver of hallway light cutting across the hardwood floor. Sophie sleeps.

## ADDITIONAL SCENES — EXPANDED MOMENTS

### Scene 134: Looking at Rain Through Bedroom Window
**Time:** 6:43 AM — gray morning light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the window
**Description:** Sophie stands at her bedroom window in her light purple star pajamas, pressing her small palm against the cold glass. Outside, Portland rain falls steadily, streaking the window in silver lines. Wet green trees — Douglas firs and maples — sway gently in the yard behind the apartment building. A neighbor's cat sits on a covered porch across the way, watching the rain. Sophie traces a raindrop's path down the glass with her fingertip, following its zigzag route. Her breath fogs a small circle on the cold pane. Her light brown hair is still messy from sleep, tangled at the back. The lavender rug is warm under her bare feet. Biscuit's cage is visible on the dresser behind her, the golden hamster curled in his plastic igloo hideout, sleeping. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling are faded pale dots in the gray morning light.

### Scene 135: Mom's Coffee Routine
**Time:** 6:55 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at the counter
**Description:** Sophie stands on the kitchen step stool beside the counter, watching Kate make coffee. The coffee maker is a black drip machine with a glass carafe. Kate pours roasted coffee grounds from a brown paper bag — "Portland Roasting Company" printed on the side — into a white paper filter in the basket. Sophie leans close, sniffing the dark grounds and wrinkling her round nose. "Smells yucky," she announces. Kate laughs. She fills the machine's reservoir with water from a measuring cup. Sophie pushes the button — a large green power button — and the machine begins to gurgle and hiss, dark coffee dripping into the glass carafe. The kitchen counter holds a ceramic sugar bowl with a small spoon, a carton of half-and-half from the refrigerator, and Kate's white coffee mug waiting empty. Sophie watches the coffee drip, fascinated by the steady stream of dark liquid.

### Scene 136: Checking the Weather Chart at Home
**Time:** 7:14 AM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, near refrigerator
**Description:** Sophie stands in front of the white refrigerator, looking at a magnetic weather chart attached to the door among the alphabet magnets and her drawings. The chart has pictures for sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, and windy weather with small magnetic icons. Sophie selects the rainy cloud icon — a blue cloud with raindrops — and places it on today's square. "Rain again, Mama," she reports solemnly. The refrigerator door is covered in colorful alphabet magnets scattered in no particular order, several of Sophie's crayon drawings held up by fruit-shaped magnets (a strawberry, a banana, an apple), and a printed school calendar with some dates circled in red marker. A grocery list notepad with a pencil on a string hangs from a magnetic clip. Sophie's teal rainbow t-shirt and striped leggings are visible. She spells out "S-O-P-H-I" with the alphabet magnets, running out of letters before finishing her name.

### Scene 137: Putting On Rain Jacket Hood
**Time:** 7:53 AM — gray hallway light
**Setting:** Apartment entryway, at mirror
**Description:** Sophie stands in the small entryway of the apartment, fully dressed in her yellow rain jacket, looking at herself in a narrow full-length mirror mounted on the back of the coat closet door. She pulls the yellow hood up over her light brown ponytail, adjusting it with both hands so it sits right. Her round face with rosy cheeks peers out from the yellow hood frame. She makes a silly face at her reflection — crossing her hazel eyes and sticking out her tongue, gap from the missing tooth visible. Then she grins at herself. Her red polka-dot rain boots are on her feet. The pink cat-face backpack is on her back, slightly tilted. Kate appears behind her in the mirror, olive green rain jacket on, jingling the car keys. The narrow mirror also reflects the family photos on the hallway wall and the shoe rack by the door.

### Scene 138: Car Seat Snack
**Time:** 8:10 AM — overcast, car interior
**Setting:** Back seat of Subaru Outback
**Description:** Sophie sits in her booster car seat in the back of the Subaru Outback, holding a small ziplock bag of goldfish crackers that Kate handed her for the drive. She picks out one cracker at a time, examining each tiny fish shape before popping it in her mouth. Her yellow rain jacket is bunched around the car seat straps. The pink cat-face backpack sits on the seat beside her. Through the rain-streaked side window, a Portland intersection is visible — a MAX light rail train passes on its tracks, a coffee shop with steamed-up windows on the corner, cyclists in rain gear waiting at the crosswalk. Sophie's red rain boots rest on the floor mat below. A few goldfish crackers have escaped the bag and sit in the car seat crevice. The car's radio plays a children's song softly. The windshield wipers continue their rhythmic sweep.

### Scene 139: Walking Into School Building
**Time:** 8:19 AM — overcast, school entrance
**Setting:** School entrance hallway
**Description:** Sophie walks through the school's front entrance into the wide hallway, her red polka-dot rain boots squeaking on the polished linoleum floor. The hallway has bulletin boards displaying student artwork — colorful paintings, paper plate crafts, and handprint trees. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. A large "WELCOME" banner in rainbow letters hangs above the main office door. Other children stream in around her, shedding rain jackets and shaking water from their hair. A teacher aide in a blue vest greets students at the door. Sophie waves to a friend — a girl in a purple coat with blonde braids — and they walk together toward the kindergarten classroom at the end of the hall. Sophie's yellow rain jacket drips water on the floor. A wet floor caution sign — bright yellow triangle — stands near the entrance. Cubbies line the wall outside each classroom door.

### Scene 140: Pledge of Allegiance
**Time:** 8:42 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, standing by tables
**Description:** Sophie stands beside her small red chair at the round table, right hand placed over her heart on her teal rainbow t-shirt. The other kindergarteners stand at their own spots around the room. Mrs. Chen stands at the front near the American flag — a standard classroom flag on a wooden pole in a brass stand near the whiteboard. Sophie recites the Pledge of Allegiance with the class, her lips moving slightly out of sync with the words, stumbling over "indivisible." Her hazel eyes are fixed on the flag's red and white stripes. Her messy ponytail, slightly damp from the rain, hangs behind her. Her velcro sneakers are planted on the alphabet rug. The alphabet banner, calendar wall, and fish tank are visible in the bright classroom background. A clock above the whiteboard shows 8:42.

### Scene 141: Writing Her Name
**Time:** 9:10 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the small round table with a fat yellow pencil — the triangular beginner's kind — gripping it in her fist. She writes her name at the top of a lined practice sheet, the letters large and wobbly on the wide-ruled paper. S-O-P-H-I-E. The S is backwards, a mirror image. The O is round but too big. The P is correct. The H leans to the right. The I has a circle dot instead of a square one. The E has four horizontal lines instead of three. She studies her work critically, comparing it to the printed "SOPHIE" on her name tag taped to the table edge. She erases the backwards S with a large pink eraser, leaving gray smudge marks on the paper, and tries again. The new S is correct — she beams. Pencil shavings litter the table. A classmate beside her writes "JAKE" in large letters.

### Scene 142: Feeding the Class Fish
**Time:** 9:25 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at fish tank
**Description:** Sophie stands on her tiptoes at the classroom counter, peering into the fish tank. The rectangular glass tank holds two small goldfish — one orange, one white with orange spots — swimming in slow circles through plastic green plants and a small ceramic castle decoration. Bubbles rise from an air pump stone on the tank floor. Blue gravel covers the bottom. Mrs. Chen has chosen Sophie as the fish feeder for the week. She holds a small container of fish food flakes — brown and flaky — and pinches a tiny amount between her thumb and forefinger. She sprinkles the flakes onto the water surface, watching them float. Both goldfish dart to the surface, mouths opening and closing rapidly as they eat. Sophie giggles. "They're hungry!" she whispers. The tank light casts a blue-green glow on her round face. A laminated card on the tank reads "Our Fish: Sunny & Bubbles."

### Scene 143: Hand Washing Before Snack
**Time:** 9:55 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, hand-washing station
**Description:** Sophie stands at the classroom's low hand-washing sink, rubbing her small hands under running water before snack time. She pumps the pink liquid soap dispenser twice, creating a lather between her palms. She sings the ABCs quietly to herself as she washes — the timing method Mrs. Chen taught for long enough hand washing. Soap bubbles form between her small fingers. She rinses under the running water, watching the suds swirl down the small drain. She pulls a brown paper towel from the wall dispenser with a tearing sound and dries each hand carefully. A line of three other kindergarteners wait behind her, shifting from foot to foot. The art supply shelf and reading corner are visible behind the hand-washing station. A poster above the sink shows illustrated hand-washing steps with cartoon animal hands.

### Scene 144: Recess — Playing Tag
**Time:** 10:28 AM — overcast, drizzle stopped
**Setting:** School playground, open grass area
**Description:** Sophie runs across the wet grass of the school playground, arms pumping, yellow rain jacket flapping open, red polka-dot rain boots pounding the soft ground. She is playing tag with three classmates. A boy in a green jacket chases her — he is "it." Sophie zigzags to avoid him, her light brown ponytail streaming behind her, a squeal of delighted laughter escaping. She ducks behind the metal pole of the swing set, peeking around it with one hazel eye, grinning her gap-toothed grin. The wet grass is littered with fallen leaves. Other children play in groups around the playground — some on the climbing structure, others drawing in a puddle with sticks. The gray Portland sky serves as backdrop, Douglas fir trees dark green along the fence line. A playground aide in an orange vest watches from the covered area nearby. Sophie's cheeks are bright red from running in the cold air.

### Scene 145: Playground — Spinning on Merry-Go-Round
**Time:** 10:32 AM — overcast
**Setting:** School playground, merry-go-round
**Description:** Sophie sits on a small metal merry-go-round on the playground — a circular platform with metal handles painted red, blue, and green. She grips the green handle with both small hands, her red rain boots planted on the platform. Two other children sit on the merry-go-round — a girl in a pink jacket holding the red handle and a boy in a blue coat on the blue handle. A fourth child pushes the merry-go-round from outside, running alongside and giving it a spin. Sophie's light brown hair whips around her face as the platform turns. Her yellow rain jacket spreads behind her. She laughs, mouth wide open, hazel eyes crinkled. The playground blurs slightly in the spinning background. Wet wood chips are visible beneath the merry-go-round. The school building's brick wall and colorful mural are in the background.

### Scene 146: Classroom Music Time
**Time:** 11:15 AM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, circle on rug
**Description:** Sophie sits on the ABC rug with her classmates during a music activity. She holds two wooden rhythm sticks — short, round, painted red — one in each small hand. Mrs. Chen taps a pattern on a small hand drum at the front of the circle: tap-tap-TAP, tap-tap-TAP. Sophie tries to copy the pattern, tapping her red sticks together. Her rhythm is slightly off, the taps coming a beat late, but she concentrates hard, her hazel eyes fixed on the teacher's hands. Other children around the circle hold different instruments — a girl shakes a blue egg shaker, a boy jingles a small tambourine with silver bells, another child taps a triangle with a tiny metal wand. The classroom is filled with a joyful, somewhat chaotic musical sound. Sophie taps her sticks on the rug, on her knee, and together in the air, experimenting with sounds.

### Scene 147: Drawing at Free Time
**Time:** 2:10 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at small table
**Description:** Sophie sits at a small round table during afternoon free time, bent over a sheet of white paper with a fistful of crayons. She draws a picture of Biscuit the hamster — a round golden circle with two small ears, round black dot eyes, a pink triangle nose, and whiskers made of straight lines radiating from the nose. She adds four small legs below the body — straight lines with tiny feet. She colors the hamster body with a brown crayon, pressing hard. Below the hamster, she draws a rectangular cage with grid lines. She adds a circle wheel inside the cage. Above the drawing, she writes "BISCUIT" in large wobbly letters — the B is backwards, but the rest is correct. She holds up the finished drawing, tilting her head to admire it. Crayon wrappers litter the table. Two other children draw at the same table — one makes a house, another draws a dinosaur.

### Scene 148: Sharing Drawing with Teacher
**Time:** 2:15 PM — bright classroom light
**Setting:** Kindergarten classroom, at teacher's desk
**Description:** Sophie walks to Mrs. Chen's desk in the corner of the classroom, holding up her Biscuit drawing with both hands. Mrs. Chen — short black hair, glasses, blue cardigan with her ID lanyard — sits at the desk marking attendance on a clipboard. She looks up as Sophie approaches. "Look Mrs. Chen, I drawed Biscuit!" Sophie exclaims, thrusting the paper forward. Mrs. Chen takes the drawing, studying it with genuine interest. "What a beautiful hamster, Sophie! Is that his wheel?" she asks, pointing to the circle in the cage. Sophie nods vigorously, her messy ponytail bouncing. Mrs. Chen reaches for a roll of blue painter's tape on her desk and helps Sophie tape the Biscuit drawing to the classroom's "Student Gallery" wall — a section near the cubbies where children's art is displayed. Sophie's drawing joins a collection of other kindergarten masterpieces. She beams with pride.

### Scene 149: Snack in the Car
**Time:** 3:20 PM — overcast
**Setting:** Back seat of Subaru Outback, parked at grocery store
**Description:** Sophie sits in her booster car seat in the parked Subaru, eating a granola bar that Kate pulled from the glove compartment. The granola bar wrapper is half-peeled back, and Sophie bites into the chewy bar, oats and chocolate chips visible. A water bottle sits in her booster seat cupholder. Her yellow rain jacket is unzipped, the pink cat-face backpack beside her on the seat. Her red rain boots rest on the floor mat, a clump of wet grass stuck to the sole of the left boot. Through the car window, the grocery store parking lot is visible — other cars parked in rows, a shopping cart return corral, and the green awning of the co-op entrance. Kate is visible through the windshield, returning a shopping cart to the corral. Sophie chews and watches a crow hop across the wet asphalt outside her window, its black feathers glossy with rain.

### Scene 150: Looking at Library Book in Car
**Time:** 3:58 PM — overcast, patches of light
**Setting:** Back seat of Subaru Outback, driving
**Description:** Sophie holds the new library book — the one about the girl and her pet hamster — open on her lap in the booster seat. She cannot read the words yet, but she studies each illustration intently, turning the pages slowly. The picture book shows a cartoon girl feeding her hamster, the hamster running on a wheel, the girl cleaning the cage. Sophie traces the hamster illustration with her fingertip, comparing it to her own Biscuit. The car moves through a Portland neighborhood — through the rain-streaked window, a row of Craftsman bungalows in muted colors is visible. Her yellow rain jacket is draped over the seat beside the backpack. The car seat harness crosses her teal rainbow t-shirt. She turns to the next page and gasps — the illustrated hamster has escaped its cage. Her hazel eyes go wide and she immediately tells Kate about it.

### Scene 151: Park — Climbing the Play Structure
**Time:** 4:15 PM — overcast with bright patches
**Setting:** Park playground, climbing structure
**Description:** Sophie climbs the wooden play structure at the neighborhood park, using both hands to grip the wooden railings. She reaches a small platform midway up, her red polka-dot rain boots finding each step carefully. The structure has a wooden ladder, a rope net, two platforms at different heights, and the green metal slide at the top. Sophie stands on the lower platform, hands gripping the railing, looking up at the higher platform above. A child ahead of her climbs the rope net to the upper level. Sophie watches, then follows — her small hands gripping the thick rope, her boots slipping slightly on the wet rope rungs. Her yellow rain jacket catches on a rope knot. She pulls it free and continues climbing, determination on her round face. Kate watches from the bench below, canvas grocery bag at her feet. The park's Douglas firs tower overhead, dark green against the gray sky.

### Scene 152: Washing Leaves in the Sink
**Time:** 5:08 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at sink
**Description:** Sophie stands on the kitchen step stool at the sink, carefully washing the leaves she collected at the park under cool running water. She holds each leaf by the stem and rinses it gently, watching dirt and tiny bits of bark wash off into the sink basin. The red maple leaf, the orange one, the yellow and brown leaves — she places each cleaned leaf on a paper towel on the counter to dry. Kate works beside her at the counter, unpacking the last of the groceries. Sophie holds up a particularly large orange maple leaf to the overhead light, examining the delicate vein pattern with fascination. "Mom, it looks like a hand!" she exclaims, spreading her small fingers behind the leaf to compare. Water drips from the leaf onto her teal rainbow t-shirt. The kitchen window above the sink shows the darkening Portland evening sky, a streetlight just flickering on outside.

### Scene 153: Drawing at the Kitchen Table
**Time:** 5:25 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Apartment kitchen, at the table
**Description:** Sophie sits at the kitchen table on her booster cushion, drawing with crayons while Kate cooks dinner at the stove behind her. The small art supply basket from the counter sits on the table — a wicker basket holding a box of crayons (24 colors, some broken), a few markers with the caps chewed, a small pair of child-safe scissors with green handles, and several sheets of white paper. Sophie draws a picture of their day — a square shape for the school building, stick figures on a playground, and a large blue car that is meant to be the Subaru. She presses the blue crayon hard, the wax flattening on the paper. Next to the car, she draws two stick figures — a tall one with brown hair (Mom) and a short one with a ponytail (herself). She adds a yellow jacket on the small figure. The smell of pasta sauce warms the kitchen. The leaf art project and the cleaned park leaves share the counter space behind her.

### Scene 154: Playing with Stuffed Animals
**Time:** 6:40 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, on the rug
**Description:** Sophie sits on the lavender rug in her bedroom, surrounded by her stuffed animals. She has arranged them in a semicircle — the floppy-eared bunny, the plush giraffe, the orange tabby cat, a small stuffed bear from her backpack, and a plush rainbow unicorn from the toy chest. She sits facing them, legs crossed, holding a small picture book open toward the animals as if reading to them. She turns the pages and narrates a story she has memorized from many readings — mostly correct, with some creative additions. Her gap-toothed mouth shapes each word carefully. The bedroom lamp casts a warm glow over the scene. Biscuit's cage is visible on the dresser — the golden hamster stands at the bars, watching Sophie's story time with his tiny dark eyes. The wooden toy chest with the rainbow is open behind her, a jumble of toys visible inside. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling are beginning to glow as the room darkens beyond the lamp's reach.

### Scene 155: Showing Mom Her Tooth Gap
**Time:** 7:32 PM — warm bedroom light
**Setting:** Sophie's bedroom, at the bookshelf mirror
**Description:** Sophie stands in her light purple star pajamas in front of the small rectangular mirror propped on the bookshelf, pulling her lower lip down and opening her mouth wide to examine the spot where her front tooth fell out. The gap is visible — pink gum, the faintest white edge of the new tooth beginning to push through. She leans close to the mirror, her hazel eyes crossing slightly as she tries to see. "Mom, I think a new tooth is coming!" she announces excitedly. Kate kneels beside her, peering at the gap. Sophie pokes the gum gently with her tongue, then with her fingertip. The small mirror reflects her round face with rosy cheeks, damp light brown hair hanging loose after bath time, and the purple star pajama collar. The basket of colorful hair ties sits on the shelf beside the mirror. The white bookshelf holds its collection of picture books. Biscuit's cage on the dresser is already draped with the purple cloth for night. Sophie grins at her reflection — the gap making her smile uniquely charming.
