# A Day in the Life of Tyler: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating educational anime-style images depicting a full day in the life of Tyler, a 16-year-old white male high school student living in small-town Ohio.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in real-world settings (textbooks at school desk, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Repetition of locations (home morning + evening) reinforces learning
- Teen/student perspective relatable to young learners
- Small-town American cultural context

## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — BEDROOM (6:30 AM - 6:50 AM)

### Scene 001: The Alarm Blaring
**Time:** 6:30 AM — dark room, phone screen glowing
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, viewed from desk area
**Description:** A 16-year-old white teenager lies in a twin bed under a navy blue comforter, face buried in a flat pillow. The room is dark except for the glowing smartphone on the wooden nightstand, its alarm blaring with a pulsing screen showing "6:30 AM." The walls are covered with posters: an Ohio State Buckeyes football poster, a Call of Duty game poster, and a Metallica band poster with torn edges. A cluttered desk holds an open laptop, scattered textbooks, loose papers, and a pencil cup. Dirty clothes dot the tan carpet floor — a pair of jeans, a wadded sock, and a hoodie draped over the desk chair. A basketball sits in the corner near the sliding closet door.

### Scene 002: Hitting Snooze
**Time:** 6:30 AM — dark room, phone glow
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** Tyler's hand emerges from under the navy comforter, blindly reaching toward the glowing smartphone on the wooden nightstand. His fingers tap the screen to silence the alarm, hitting the snooze button. The phone screen shows "6:30 — Snooze 9 min." A half-empty plastic water bottle, a tangled pair of white earbuds, and a white charging cable clutter the nightstand surface. A small digital clock behind the phone glows red. The hand retreats back under the warm covers immediately.

### Scene 003: Second Alarm Goes Off
**Time:** 6:39 AM — slightly lighter room
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, bed view
**Description:** The phone alarm goes off again, the screen bright in the still-dim room, showing "6:39 AM." Tyler is a visible lump under the navy comforter, face pressed into the pillow, groaning. A thin sliver of gray morning light peeks through the white window blinds across the room. The posters on the wall are barely distinguishable in the darkness. The basketball in the corner is a dark shape. The room has that heavy early morning stillness, the only sound the buzzing alarm.

### Scene 004: Mom Calling from Downstairs
**Time:** 6:40 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, bed view toward closed door
**Description:** Tyler lies in bed, comforter pulled over his head, only his messy sandy brown hair visible on the pillow. Through the closed bedroom door, his mom's muffled voice carries up from downstairs: "Tyler! Time to get up!" A faint strip of hallway light shows under the door gap. The room is dim, the blinds still closed. His phone screen has gone dark again on the nightstand. The desk with its mess of homework papers and open laptop is a shadowy outline.

### Scene 005: Sitting Up Reluctantly
**Time:** 6:41 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, side view of bed
**Description:** Tyler sits up in bed, sandy brown hair messy and sticking up at odd angles, blue eyes barely open, face puffy with sleep. He wears a faded gray t-shirt with a cracked graphic logo and black basketball shorts. One hand rubs his face while the other grabs his phone from the nightstand. The navy comforter is bunched around his waist and legs. His expression is pure teenage reluctance — eyes half-lidded, mouth slightly open in a yawn. The desk with its open laptop and stacked textbooks is visible across the room.

### Scene 006: Checking Phone for Texts
**Time:** 6:42 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, close-up on Tyler and phone
**Description:** Tyler sits on the edge of the bed, legs dangling, hunched over his phone. The blue-white screen light illuminates his tired face. He scrolls through notifications — a group chat with friends showing several unread messages, Instagram notifications, a Snapchat notification. His thumbs move across the screen. The charging cable dangles from the nightstand, pulled from the phone. His bare feet hover above the tan carpet, toes curling against the morning chill.

### Scene 007: Scrolling Social Media
**Time:** 6:44 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, on bed with phone
**Description:** Tyler is still sitting on the bed edge, scrolling through TikTok on his phone, the screen showing short video content. His expression shifts from tired to slightly amused, the faintest grin crossing his face at something on screen. His posture is hunched forward, elbows on knees. The navy comforter is pushed behind him. Morning light begins filtering weakly through the blinds, casting pale gray strips across the carpet. Two minutes lost to the phone already.

### Scene 008: Feet on the Floor
**Time:** 6:45 AM — dim morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, low angle
**Description:** Tyler's bare feet press onto the tan carpet floor, stepping off the bed. His black basketball shorts are visible below the knee. Near his feet on the carpet: a pair of white Vans sneakers with scuff marks, a dirty balled-up sock, and the corner of a snack wrapper peeking out from under the bed frame. The bed's wooden frame leg is in the foreground. A charging cable snakes under the bed. He stands slowly, reluctantly vertical.

### Scene 009: Standing and Stretching
**Time:** 6:46 AM — growing morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, full room view
**Description:** Tyler stands in the middle of his bedroom stretching, both arms raised overhead, fingers interlocked, yawning widely. He wears the faded gray t-shirt and black basketball shorts, his sleep outfit. The room reveals full teenage clutter: desk with open laptop and scattered textbooks, a gaming headset with green accents hanging on the desk chair back, an overflowing plastic laundry basket in the corner, basketball beside the closet door, black Jansport backpack slumped on the floor, and a phone charger cord trailing across the carpet. Faint morning light leaks through the blinds.

### Scene 010: Opening the Blinds
**Time:** 6:47 AM — bright light floods in
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at the window
**Description:** Tyler pulls the cord on the white window blinds, twisting them open. Morning light floods the room, illuminating the teenager and his messy bedroom in sudden brightness. Through the window: a quiet residential street in small-town Ohio, modest two-story homes with vinyl siding across the street, a large oak tree in the front yard, dew glistening on the lawn, a pickup truck parked in a neighbor's driveway. Tyler squints hard against the light, one hand shielding his eyes, his sandy brown hair lit golden from the side.

### Scene 011: Grabbing Towel and Clothes
**Time:** 6:48 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at closet and floor
**Description:** Tyler stands at his open sliding closet door, pulling a slightly damp towel from a hook on the inside of the door. The closet shows typical teen contents: hoodies on hangers — a maroon zip-up, a gray Nike pullover, a black one with a band logo — several graphic t-shirts, jeans, one wrinkled dress shirt pushed to the side. Sneakers are scattered on the closet floor: white Vans, black Nikes, old running shoes. A skateboard leans against the inside wall. Tyler tosses the towel over his shoulder and grabs a pair of jeans from a shelf.

### Scene 012: Heading to the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:50 AM — hallway light
**Setting:** Upstairs hallway, leaving bedroom
**Description:** Tyler walks out of his bedroom into the upstairs hallway, towel over one shoulder, jeans and a folded graphic t-shirt tucked under his arm. The hallway has beige carpet, family photos lining the walls in simple frames — school portraits, a family vacation shot at a lake, a photo of Tyler and Lily as young kids. His younger sister Lily's bedroom door is slightly ajar across the hall, decorated with a purple nameplate and horse stickers. The bathroom door is at the end of the hall, closed. Tyler shuffles toward it, still half asleep.

---

## PART 2: BATHROOM (6:50 AM - 7:10 AM)

### Scene 013: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:51 AM — bathroom light on
**Setting:** Family bathroom, doorway
**Description:** Tyler pushes open the bathroom door and flicks on the overhead light with his elbow, hands full of clothes and towel. The family bathroom is revealed: white tile floor with a bath mat, a single vanity with a white porcelain sink and chrome faucet, a large rectangular mirror above the vanity, a toilet beside the sink, and a bathtub with a shower curtain in a blue-and-white striped pattern. Two toothbrush holders sit on the counter — one holding a blue toothbrush, the other a pink one (Lily's). Towels in various colors hang on a chrome bar. He dumps his clothes on the closed toilet lid.

### Scene 014: Looking in the Mirror
**Time:** 6:52 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Tyler stands at the vanity, both hands resting on the countertop edge, staring at his own reflection in the mirror. His sandy brown hair is a mess — flattened on one side, sticking up on the other. His face shows typical teen skin: a few red acne spots on his forehead and chin, slightly oily from sleep. Blue eyes look tired, puffy. The mirror reflects the toiletries on the counter behind him: a tube of Crest toothpaste, a bottle of Neutrogena face wash (blue bottle), a stick of Old Spice deodorant, and a comb he rarely uses.

### Scene 015: Turning on the Faucet
**Time:** 6:53 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, close-up on sink
**Description:** Close-up of Tyler's hand turning the chrome faucet handle at the bathroom sink. Water begins to flow from the spout into the white porcelain basin. His fingers grip the cold-water handle. The sink basin reflects the overhead vanity light. Small water droplets splash on the white counter surface. The drain is visible at the bottom of the basin. A bar of white soap sits in a ceramic dish next to the faucet.

### Scene 016: Splashing Water on Face
**Time:** 6:53 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, side view at sink
**Description:** Tyler leans over the sink, cupping cold water in both hands and splashing it onto his face. Water drips from his chin and the tip of his nose back into the basin. His eyes are shut tight, face scrunched at the cold shock. The mirror reflects his hunched posture. Water droplets scatter across the counter. The blue Neutrogena face wash bottle waits nearby on the counter.

### Scene 017: Applying Face Wash
**Time:** 6:54 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, close-up on hands and face
**Description:** Tyler squeezes a dime-sized amount of Neutrogena acne face wash from the blue bottle into his palm. He rubs his hands together, creating a slight clear lather, then applies it to his face with both hands, working the product over his forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin in small circles. His eyes are closed, mouth set in a line of routine concentration. A few suds form along his hairline. Teen skincare for acne — dermatologist recommended twice daily.

### Scene 018: Rinsing Face Wash
**Time:** 6:55 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Tyler cups water from the running faucet and rinses the face wash off, splashing repeatedly. Water streams down his face and drips from his jawline into the basin. His eyes are closed as he rinses, leaning forward over the sink. Soapy water swirls in the basin. He reaches blindly for the hand towel hanging on the small chrome ring beside the mirror.

### Scene 019: Drying Face
**Time:** 6:56 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Tyler pats his face dry with a white hand towel, pressing the fabric against his cheeks and forehead. His skin looks fresher now, slightly pink from the wash. He lowers the towel and examines his face in the mirror — checking the acne, running a finger over a spot on his chin. He hangs the towel back on the chrome ring. His reflection stares back, slightly more awake than before.

### Scene 020: Applying Toothpaste to Brush
**Time:** 6:57 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, counter close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Tyler squeezing Crest toothpaste from a white tube onto a blue toothbrush. The white paste with blue stripes curls onto the bristles. The toothbrush holder on the counter has two slots — his blue brush is removed, Lily's pink one remains in place. The toothpaste tube is slightly squeezed in the middle, cap resting on the counter beside it. Water still drips slowly from the faucet.

### Scene 021: Brushing Teeth
**Time:** 6:58 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Tyler brushes his teeth in front of the mirror, the blue toothbrush moving back and forth across his teeth. White foam forms around his mouth. His free left hand rests flat on the counter. He watches his own reflection with a slightly bored, half-lidded expression — this routine is automatic. The Crest tube lies on its side nearby. The bathroom light casts even white light on his face. His sandy brown hair is still a disheveled mess.

### Scene 022: Spitting and Rinsing Mouth
**Time:** 7:00 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, over sink
**Description:** Tyler spits white toothpaste foam into the sink, then cups water from the running faucet to rinse his mouth, swishing and spitting again. The foam swirls in the basin and flows toward the chrome drain. He rinses the blue toothbrush under the stream of water, taps it twice on the edge of the sink, and places it back in the ceramic holder. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Fresh mouth.

### Scene 023: Applying Deodorant
**Time:** 7:01 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, standing at counter
**Description:** Tyler lifts the hem of his gray sleep t-shirt and applies stick deodorant under one arm — the deodorant is a blue Old Spice stick with a white twist-up mechanism. Quick swipes under the left arm, then switches to the right. The deodorant cap sits on the counter. He replaces the cap and sets the stick back among the toiletries. A quick essential of morning hygiene completed.

### Scene 024: Attempting to Fix Hair
**Time:** 7:02 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, facing mirror, close-up
**Description:** Tyler stands close to the mirror, running his fingers through his sandy brown hair, attempting to style it without any product. He pushes the hair to one side, then the other, trying to make the bedhead look intentionally messy rather than sleep-messy. He tilts his head left, then right, checking different angles in the mirror. He runs his hand through it one more time, settling on a side-swept look that will probably fall apart in ten minutes. No gel, no product — just fingers and hope. Typical teen hair moment.

### Scene 025: Quick Shower — Turning on Water
**Time:** 7:03 AM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, bathtub/shower
**Description:** Tyler pulls back the blue-and-white striped shower curtain and reaches in to turn the chrome shower knob. Water sprays from the showerhead mounted on the tiled wall above the tub. He tests the temperature with his outstretched hand, waiting for it to warm up. Steam begins to curl upward. The bath mat — a white rectangle — sits on the tile floor in front of the tub. The toilet with his clothes stacked on the lid is visible to the side.

### Scene 026: Quick Shower — Under the Water
**Time:** 7:05 AM — steamy bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, shower, partially behind curtain
**Description:** Tyler stands under the shower spray, eyes closed, water streaming over his sandy brown hair and face. His hair is slicked flat against his head. The shower curtain is pulled most of the way closed, obscuring his body — only his head, shoulders and the top of the curtain are visible. Steam fills the upper part of the bathroom. A bottle of generic shampoo and a bar of soap sit on the tub ledge. The water runs hot, a quick wake-up rinse more than a thorough scrub.

### Scene 027: Quick Shower — Shampooing
**Time:** 7:06 AM — steamy bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, shower
**Description:** Tyler's hands work shampoo into a white lather in his sandy brown hair, eyes squeezed shut to keep suds out. The shampoo bottle sits on the tub ledge — a green bottle of generic store-brand shampoo. Foam covers his head and drips slightly down his forehead. Water sprays from the showerhead onto his shoulders. He scrubs quickly — teen boys do not linger in the shower on school mornings.

### Scene 028: Quick Shower — Rinsing and Done
**Time:** 7:07 AM — steamy bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, shower turning off
**Description:** Tyler tilts his head back under the spray, rinsing shampoo out as white foam streams down his back. He reaches for the chrome shower handle and turns it off. The water flow slows to a drip from the showerhead. He pushes the shower curtain open, reaching for the towel hanging on the chrome bar. Water drips from his hair and down his face. The bathroom is humid, mirror completely fogged.

### Scene 029: Drying Off
**Time:** 7:08 AM — steamy bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, stepping out of tub
**Description:** Tyler steps out of the tub onto the white bath mat, wrapping a blue towel around his waist. Water drips from his hair onto his shoulders. He grabs a second smaller towel and rubs it vigorously over his head, messing his wet hair in every direction. The fogged mirror shows only a blurry outline of his reflection. The tile floor has a few wet footprints. Steam slowly drifts toward the ceiling vent.

---

## PART 3: GETTING DRESSED (7:10 AM - 7:20 AM)

### Scene 030: Wiping Mirror
**Time:** 7:10 AM — bathroom light, steam clearing
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Tyler swipes his hand across the fogged bathroom mirror, clearing a streak so he can see his reflection. His wet sandy brown hair is plastered flat and dark against his head. His face is flushed from the hot shower. He stands bare-chested with the blue towel still around his waist. The cleared streak in the mirror shows his reflection — blue eyes, clean skin, dripping hair. The rest of the mirror is still foggy around the edges.

### Scene 031: Pulling on Jeans
**Time:** 7:11 AM — bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, dressing
**Description:** Tyler pulls on his jeans from the stack of clothes on the toilet lid. He steps into the medium blue denim, slightly worn at the knees, and pulls them up, buttoning and zipping. The jeans are a comfortable lived-in fit — not new, not falling apart. He's still shirtless, towel tossed on the floor. The foggy mirror behind him shows his gangly teenage frame. His wet hair drips onto his bare shoulders.

### Scene 032: Putting on Graphic T-Shirt
**Time:** 7:12 AM — bathroom light
**Setting:** Family bathroom, dressing
**Description:** Tyler pulls a black graphic t-shirt over his head, arms pushing through the sleeves. The shirt features a faded band logo — some alternative rock group, the letters barely legible from washing. He tugs the hem down over his jeans. His wet hair sticks up in strange angles after pulling the shirt over it. He runs his fingers through it again quickly, a losing battle against the dampness.

### Scene 033: Checking Outfit in Mirror
**Time:** 7:13 AM — bathroom light, steam mostly gone
**Setting:** Family bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Tyler looks at himself in the mostly-cleared bathroom mirror. He wears the black graphic t-shirt and medium blue jeans. He turns slightly, checking the outfit from different angles — a brief self-assessment. He adjusts the shirt collar where it bunched during the pull-over. His damp hair is starting to dry into its natural messy waves. He looks like a standard American high school junior. Acceptable. He gathers his sleep clothes from the floor.

### Scene 034: Back in Bedroom — Dumping Sleep Clothes
**Time:** 7:14 AM — bedroom, morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, near laundry basket
**Description:** Tyler walks back into his bedroom, tossing his wadded-up sleep clothes — the gray t-shirt and black basketball shorts — toward the overflowing plastic laundry basket in the corner. They land half-in, half-out, draping over the edge. He does not fix them. The bedroom is brighter now with the blinds open, morning light streaming across the messy room. Posters on the walls are fully visible. The desk with its homework mess catches the light.

### Scene 035: Putting on Flannel Shirt
**Time:** 7:15 AM — bedroom, morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at closet
**Description:** Tyler reaches into his open closet and grabs a red-and-black plaid flannel shirt from a hanger. He pulls it on over the graphic t-shirt, leaving it unbuttoned as an open layer. The flannel is soft and well-worn, slightly too big in the shoulders — maybe a hand-me-down or purchased oversized on purpose. He pushes the sleeves up to his elbows, a casual teen look. The closet behind him shows remaining hoodies and shirts on hangers.

### Scene 036: Sitting on Bed — Putting on Socks
**Time:** 7:16 AM — bedroom, morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, sitting on bed
**Description:** Tyler sits on the edge of his unmade twin bed, pulling on white athletic socks. He grabs them from a drawer in his dresser that he left partially open. The socks are plain white crew socks, standard teenage uniform. He pulls one on each foot, wiggling his toes. The navy comforter is pushed to one side, the white sheets wrinkled underneath. His phone sits on the nightstand, screen dark.

### Scene 037: Putting on Sneakers
**Time:** 7:17 AM — bedroom, morning light
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, floor level
**Description:** Tyler shoves his feet into his white Vans sneakers without untying them — a universal teen habit. The shoes are well-worn, the white canvas scuffed and faintly gray, the rubber soles slightly dirty. He stamps each foot once to settle into the shoes. He does not tie them — the laces are permanently loosely knotted from the last time he bothered. The tan carpet shows shoe scuffs near where the sneakers usually sit.

### Scene 038: Packing Backpack
**Time:** 7:18 AM — bedroom, at desk
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk area
**Description:** Tyler stands at his desk, shoving notebooks and textbooks into his black Jansport backpack. The backpack is well-worn, a zipper pull slightly frayed, covered in a few drawn-on doodles in Sharpie. On the desk: the open laptop showing last night's half-finished homework tab, scattered loose papers, a graphing calculator, pencils and pens in a cup, an empty Mountain Dew can from last night. He zips the main compartment — the backpack sags with the weight of heavy textbooks. He grabs the graphing calculator and shoves it in the front pocket.

### Scene 039: Grabbing Backpack and Phone
**Time:** 7:19 AM — bedroom, heading out
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, doorway
**Description:** Tyler swings the heavy black Jansport backpack onto one shoulder, the weight pulling him slightly to one side. He grabs his phone from the nightstand and stuffs it into his jeans pocket. He also grabs his white earbuds from the nightstand, tangling them slightly as he shoves them into his flannel shirt pocket. He takes one last glance at his room — the unmade bed, the mess, the glow of the laptop screen he forgot to close — and heads out the door into the hallway.

### Scene 040: Heading Downstairs
**Time:** 7:20 AM — stairway
**Setting:** Staircase, descending
**Description:** Tyler descends the carpeted stairs, backpack slung over one shoulder, one hand sliding along the wooden banister. The stairway walls are lined with framed family photos: Tyler and Lily as kids at a lake, a family Christmas portrait, school photos in matching oval frames. The smell of breakfast drifts up from the kitchen below — something cooking, coffee brewing. Tyler's sneakers pad quietly on the beige carpet. At the bottom of the stairs, the front entryway and living room are visible.

---

## PART 4: BREAKFAST WITH FAMILY (7:20 AM - 7:40 AM)

### Scene 041: Entering the Kitchen
**Time:** 7:20 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen doorway
**Description:** Tyler enters the family kitchen, ducking slightly through the doorway out of gangly teenage habit. His mom, Karen — a white woman in her early 40s with light brown hair pulled back in a low ponytail, wearing a simple green cardigan and jeans — stands at the stove, stirring scrambled eggs in a pan. The kitchen is modest but clean: white cabinets with chrome handles, beige laminate countertops, a window over the sink showing the backyard. A coffee maker on the counter brews, the pot half-full. A round wooden kitchen table with four chairs sits in the center.

### Scene 042: Greeting Mom
**Time:** 7:21 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, near table
**Description:** "Morning," Tyler mumbles, dropping his heavy backpack on the floor beside the table with a thud. Karen turns from the stove, spatula in hand, smiling. "Morning, hon. Sleep okay?" Tyler shrugs — the universal teen non-answer. A glass of orange juice already sits at Tyler's usual spot at the round table — Karen poured it. Salt and pepper shakers, a paper napkin holder, and a small ceramic sugar bowl sit in the center of the table. Dad's chair is empty — Mike already left for the early shift at the factory.

### Scene 043: Sitting Down at Table
**Time:** 7:22 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Tyler slumps into his usual chair at the round wooden kitchen table, the chair scraping on the linoleum floor. The table has four mismatched placemats — his is a faded blue one. The orange juice glass sits in front of him, condensation forming on the outside. He pulls out his phone and sets it face-up on the table beside his placemat, checking it out of habit. Through the window over the sink, the backyard is visible: a small lawn, a rusting swing set from when the kids were younger, a wooden privacy fence.

### Scene 044: Mom Serving Breakfast
**Time:** 7:23 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, table
**Description:** Karen places a plate in front of Tyler: a pile of fluffy scrambled eggs, two pieces of white toast with butter already spread, and three strips of crispy bacon. Steam rises from the eggs. She smiles at him. "Eat up, the bus comes at 7:45." A similar plate sits at Lily's spot. Karen turns back to the stove to make her own smaller plate. A stick of butter in a dish, a jar of grape jelly, and a bottle of ketchup sit on the table.

### Scene 045: Eating Breakfast
**Time:** 7:25 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Tyler eats breakfast with quick teenage efficiency, fork scooping scrambled eggs into his mouth. He takes a large bite of buttered toast, crumbs falling onto the plate. The orange juice glass is already half empty — he drank a big gulp immediately. His phone screen lights up on the table with a notification, but he ignores it for now, focused on the food. The bacon strips disappear quickly. Karen sits down across from him with her own plate and a mug of coffee, checking her phone — shift schedule at the library.

### Scene 046: Lily Arriving at Table
**Time:** 7:27 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen doorway and table
**Description:** Lily, Tyler's 12-year-old sister, enters the kitchen. She has light brown hair in a high ponytail, wearing a purple hoodie and blue jeans, her pink backpack already on both shoulders. She's bright-eyed and more of a morning person than Tyler. "Is there bacon?" She slides into her chair, eyeing Tyler's plate. She's already dressed and ready — organized in a way Tyler is not. Tyler rolls his eyes slightly. Typical sibling morning energy.

### Scene 047: Family Breakfast Scene
**Time:** 7:29 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, wide view
**Description:** The kitchen table with three of the four family members: Tyler eating eggs and toast, Lily now seated with her own plate of scrambled eggs and a piece of toast, Karen eating between sips of coffee and checking her phone. Dad's chair is conspicuously empty — Mike leaves for the factory at 6:00 AM. Morning family chaos in miniature: Lily asks about a permission slip, Karen reminds Tyler about his overdue library book, Tyler grunts acknowledgment. Forks scrape plates. The coffee maker gurgles on the counter.

### Scene 048: Finishing Breakfast
**Time:** 7:32 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen table, close-up
**Description:** Tyler's plate is nearly empty — just egg residue, toast crumbs, and a smear of ketchup from the eggs. He drains the last of his orange juice, tipping the glass all the way back. He sets the empty glass down and picks up his phone, checking the text messages that came in during breakfast. He types a quick response to Jake in the group chat, thumbs moving fast. Lily is still eating, much slower and more deliberate than her brother.

### Scene 049: Taking Dishes to Sink
**Time:** 7:34 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen sink area
**Description:** Tyler carries his plate and glass to the kitchen sink, rinsing them quickly under the running faucet. Through the window above the sink, the backyard is clearly visible: the small lawn with a few fallen leaves, the old swing set with chains slightly rusted, the wooden fence, a bird feeder hanging from a post. He sets the rinsed dishes in the sink — no time to load the dishwasher. Water drips from the faucet. Karen calls from the table: "Don't forget to take lunch money."

### Scene 050: Getting Lunch Money
**Time:** 7:35 AM — bright kitchen light
**Setting:** Kitchen, by counter
**Description:** Karen reaches into her purse sitting on the kitchen counter — a practical brown leather bag — and pulls out a $5 bill. She hands it to Tyler. "Lunch money. And please eat actual food, not just chips from the vending machine." Tyler takes the folded bill, stuffing it into his front jeans pocket. "Thanks, Mom." He grabs his black Jansport backpack from the floor by the table, swinging it onto one shoulder.

### Scene 051: Heading to the Front Door
**Time:** 7:37 AM — front entryway
**Setting:** Front entryway, near door
**Description:** Tyler walks through the living room to the front entryway. He passes the living room couch — a brown sectional with throw pillows — and the TV mounted on the wall. The entryway has a small wooden bench, a coat rack with jackets of various sizes, and shoes lined up on the floor: Dad's brown work boots, Mom's flats, Lily's pink sneakers, Tyler's other pair of shoes. A mirror on the wall reflects the entryway. Tyler pauses by the front door.

### Scene 052: Goodbye and Out the Door
**Time:** 7:38 AM — front entryway
**Setting:** Kitchen/entryway transition
**Description:** Tyler calls "Bye!" toward the kitchen, one hand on the front door handle. Karen's voice carries back: "Have a good day! Don't forget your library book!" Lily adds from the kitchen: "Bye, loser!" Tyler ignores the insult — standard sibling communication. He pulls open the front door, stepping out onto the concrete front porch. The cool autumn morning air hits his face. The screen door swings shut behind him with a metallic clatter.

## PART 5: SCHOOL BUS (7:40 AM - 8:10 AM)

### Scene 053: Walking to the Bus Stop
**Time:** 7:40 AM — exterior, cool autumn morning
**Setting:** Residential sidewalk
**Description:** Tyler walks down the concrete sidewalk of his quiet residential street, backpack bouncing on one shoulder. Small-town Ohio homes line both sides: modest two-stories with vinyl siding, some single-story ranches, well-maintained lawns scattered with fallen autumn leaves in orange and gold. His breath fogs slightly in the cool October morning air. He has his earbuds in, one dangling loose, music faintly audible. The street is quiet — a few cars in driveways, a dog barking somewhere. The bus stop is at the corner, a block and a half away.

### Scene 054: Arriving at the Bus Stop
**Time:** 7:43 AM — exterior, morning light
**Setting:** Street corner with bus stop sign
**Description:** Tyler reaches the bus stop at the corner — marked by a yellow "SCHOOL BUS STOP" sign on a metal post. Two other students already wait: a younger boy, maybe 12, middle school age, with a huge backpack dwarfing his frame, and a girl Tyler's age with dark hair and a denim jacket, scrolling through her phone. Nobody talks — morning quiet, everyone in their own bubble. Tyler stands a few feet apart, checking his phone too, earbuds still in. A few cars pass on the cross street. Fallen leaves skitter across the pavement in a light breeze.

### Scene 055: Waiting and Checking Phone
**Time:** 7:45 AM — exterior
**Setting:** Bus stop, standing
**Description:** Tyler stands at the bus stop, phone held in front of his face, scrolling through the group chat with Jake and other friends. Messages about last night's gaming session, someone complaining about the math test today. Tyler types a quick message: a gaming reference that makes him smirk. He stamps his feet lightly against the cold — he didn't wear a jacket, just the open flannel over the t-shirt, a decision he slightly regrets now. The morning sun is bright but offers little warmth.

### Scene 056: Bus Approaching
**Time:** 7:47 AM — exterior
**Setting:** Street corner, bus visible
**Description:** A yellow school bus appears at the far end of the street, red lights beginning to flash as it slows. "SCHOOL BUS" is painted in bold black letters on the side. The bus grows larger as it approaches, the stop sign arm extending from the driver's side. Brakes squeak as the bus pulls to a stop in front of the waiting students. The folding door swings open with a mechanical hiss. The diesel engine rumbles. Tyler pockets his phone and pulls out one earbud.

### Scene 057: Boarding the Bus
**Time:** 7:48 AM — bus steps
**Setting:** School bus entrance
**Description:** Tyler climbs the three ribbed rubber steps of the school bus, one hand on the metal handrail. The bus driver — an older woman with gray hair pulled back, glasses on a chain around her neck, wearing a green vest — nods at him. "Morning, Tyler." "Morning." The bus interior stretches behind her: rows of green vinyl bench seats, students already seated and chatting, backpacks piled on laps and in aisles. The noise level is moderate — louder toward the back. Tyler steps into the aisle.

### Scene 058: Walking Down the Aisle
**Time:** 7:48 AM — bus interior
**Setting:** School bus aisle
**Description:** Tyler walks down the narrow aisle of the school bus, stepping over a backpack someone left in the walkway. Students of various ages fill the green vinyl seats — loud middle schoolers near the front, high schoolers claimed the back rows. A friend waves from a seat three rows from the back: Jake, a 16-year-old white kid with dark brown hair under a backward baseball cap, wearing a blue hoodie. "Tyler! Over here!" Tyler nods and makes his way toward him, the bus swaying slightly as it starts to pull away from the curb.

### Scene 059: Sitting with Jake
**Time:** 7:49 AM — bus interior
**Setting:** School bus seat, near back
**Description:** Tyler drops into the green vinyl bench seat next to Jake, their backpacks squeezed between their knees and the seat in front. They do a quick fist bump — no words needed, the standard greeting. "Dude, did you study for the math test?" Jake asks, adjusting his baseball cap. Tyler shrugs. "Kinda. You?" "Not really." The bus bounces over a pothole. The vinyl seat is slightly torn on the edge, yellow foam peeking through. Windows rattle in their frames.

### Scene 060: Talking with Jake on the Bus
**Time:** 7:52 AM — bus interior
**Setting:** School bus seat
**Description:** Tyler and Jake talk animatedly in their bus seat, conversation bouncing between topics: the video game they played online last night, the math test they're both nervous about, weekend plans, whether the football team will win Friday's game. Jake gestures while talking, nearly smacking the kid in the seat ahead. Tyler laughs at something Jake says. Through the bus window behind them, small-town Ohio slides past: houses with front porches, a church with a white steeple, a gas station on the corner.

### Scene 061: Earbuds and Window Gazing
**Time:** 7:58 AM — bus interior
**Setting:** School bus, Tyler at window
**Description:** The conversation lulls and Tyler puts his earbuds back in, one in each ear, leaning his head against the cold bus window. His phone plays music — the screen shows an album cover in the music app. Through the glass, small-town Ohio rolls by: Main Street with its local shops — a hardware store, a diner with a neon "OPEN" sign, a Dollar General — autumn trees lining the sidewalks with red and gold leaves, the town water tower visible against the pale blue sky in the distance. Tyler watches it all pass with an absent expression, lost in thought and music.

### Scene 062: Bus at Red Light
**Time:** 8:02 AM — bus interior
**Setting:** School bus, stopped
**Description:** The school bus stops at a traffic light at the main intersection of town. Through the wide front windshield, the intersection is visible: a blinking traffic light, a gas station on one corner, a small bank on another. Tyler pulls out one earbud, looking at his phone — a text from another friend, Marcus, about the math test: "we're cooked." Tyler grins and types back a skull emoji. The bus has gotten fuller with each stop, noise level rising. A few more blocks to school.

### Scene 063: School Coming into View
**Time:** 8:07 AM — bus interior/exterior
**Setting:** School bus, school visible through window
**Description:** Through the bus window, Jefferson High School comes into view: a large two-story red brick building with a flat roof, an American flag on a tall pole out front snapping in the breeze. "JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL — HOME OF THE TIGERS" reads the marquee sign by the road, with "HOMECOMING OCT 15" on the changeable letter board below. The parking lot is filling with cars — students who drive, teachers' vehicles. Other yellow school buses line up in the bus lane along the side. Students mill around the front entrance in groups. Tyler pulls out both earbuds, stuffing them in his pocket.

### Scene 064: Exiting the Bus
**Time:** 8:10 AM — bus exit/exterior
**Setting:** School bus lane
**Description:** Tyler stands in the bus aisle, waiting his turn to file off, then steps down the rubber steps and onto the pavement of the bus lane. Other students stream off the bus behind him. The school building looms ahead, its brick facade solid and familiar. Jake exits right behind Tyler. "Ready for the math test?" Jake asks. "No," Tyler says flatly. They walk toward the school entrance together, joining the flow of students converging from buses, cars, and the surrounding neighborhood sidewalks. The morning sun casts long shadows across the parking lot.

---

## PART 6: MORNING AT SCHOOL (8:10 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Scene 065: School Front Entrance
**Time:** 8:12 AM — exterior, morning sun
**Setting:** School front entrance
**Description:** Tyler and Jake approach the Jefferson High School front entrance — double glass doors with metal push bars, propped partially open. Students stream inside in a steady flow. A teacher in a button-down shirt stands by the door, greeting students and making sure IDs are visible. The brick building has a cornerstone reading "1987." Autumn leaves blow across the concrete sidewalk. A few students linger outside, finishing conversations before the bell. A banner over the entrance reads "GO TIGERS!" in orange and black.

### Scene 066: Main Hallway
**Time:** 8:13 AM — interior, fluorescent lights
**Setting:** School main hallway
**Description:** Tyler pushes through the double doors into the main hallway. Bright fluorescent tube lights run along the ceiling. The hallway is wide with beige walls and linoleum floors, blue metal lockers lining both sides in long rows. A glass trophy case near the entrance displays football and basketball trophies, team photos, and a "State Semifinals 2019" banner. Students fill the hallway — noise echoing off the hard surfaces. Overhead, a banner for the Homecoming Dance hangs from the ceiling. Tyler and Jake split up, heading to their respective lockers.

### Scene 067: At the Locker — Combination
**Time:** 8:15 AM — hallway
**Setting:** Blue locker section, hallway
**Description:** Tyler stands at his blue metal locker, spinning the black combination dial. Right to 32, left past zero to 14, right to 8. The lock clicks and he lifts the handle. The locker door swings open, revealing: textbooks stacked vertically, spiral notebooks wedged in, a small magnetic mirror on the inside of the door, a photo of Tyler with friends taped to the back wall, and an old gym bag crumpled at the bottom. A faint smell of old socks wafts out. He drops his heavy backpack on the floor between his feet.

### Scene 068: Swapping Books
**Time:** 8:16 AM — hallway, at locker
**Setting:** At open locker
**Description:** Tyler swaps books between his backpack and locker, a practiced choreography. He pulls out his heavy math textbook and a spiral notebook — the test is first period. He checks that his graphing calculator is in the backpack's front pocket. His English novel, The Great Gatsby with its blue cover, goes into the backpack too — second period. The history and chemistry books stay in the locker for now. He shoves things around, making room. The hallway bustles with students doing the same at their own lockers.

### Scene 069: Slamming Locker Shut
**Time:** 8:18 AM — hallway
**Setting:** Locker section
**Description:** Tyler slams his locker shut with a metallic bang that blends into the chorus of locker slams echoing down the hallway. He spins the combination dial to scramble it. The hallway is crowded now — students rush between lockers and classrooms. A couple holds hands near the water fountain. A group of girls laugh at something on a phone screen. The warning bell sounds over the intercom — five minutes to first period. Tyler shoulders his backpack and turns toward the math wing.

### Scene 070: Walking to First Period
**Time:** 8:19 AM — hallway
**Setting:** School hallway
**Description:** Tyler walks down the hallway toward his first class, weaving through the flow of other students. Lockers blur past on both sides. Classroom doors have white number plates and teacher nameplates. A poster on the wall advertises: "HOMECOMING DANCE — OCTOBER 15 — Tickets $15." Another poster promotes the school play. The linoleum floor is scuffed from thousands of sneaker soles. Tyler nods to a kid he knows passing in the opposite direction — a quick upward chin jerk, the universal male teen greeting.

### Scene 071: Entering Math Class
**Time:** 8:22 AM — classroom doorway
**Setting:** Math classroom entrance
**Description:** Tyler enters the math classroom. Desks are arranged in five neat rows of six, each a one-piece unit with an attached chair and a fake wood-grain writing surface. A large whiteboard dominates the front wall, already covered in algebraic equations from the previous class. The teacher, Mr. Henderson — a white man in his late 50s with thinning gray hair, wire-rimmed glasses, and a short-sleeve button-down shirt with a pocket protector — arranges stacks of test papers at his large wooden desk. A motivational poster reads "MATH IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT." Students file in, quiet and nervous.

### Scene 072: Sitting at His Desk
**Time:** 8:23 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Math classroom, Tyler's seat
**Description:** Tyler slides into his assigned desk — third row, second seat from the window. The metal chair legs scrape on the linoleum. He sets his backpack on the floor beside him, pulling out his graphing calculator and a number-two pencil, placing them on the desk surface. The room fills with students taking their seats, pre-test anxiety thick in the air. Some students flip frantically through notebooks for last-minute review. Tyler stares at the whiteboard, trying to recall the quadratic formula. His knee bounces under the desk.

### Scene 073: Receiving the Test
**Time:** 8:25 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Math classroom
**Description:** The bell rings — a harsh electronic buzz from a speaker above the door. Mr. Henderson stands at the front, adjusting his glasses. "Phones away, calculators on desks. You have 45 minutes." He walks down each row, placing test papers face-down on every desk. A test paper lands on Tyler's desk with a soft slap. Tyler glances at Jake two rows over — Jake looks pale. Tyler flips the paper over. The header reads "ALGEBRA II — CHAPTER 4 TEST." Equations and word problems fill both sides of the page.

### Scene 074: Working Through the Test
**Time:** 8:35 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Math classroom, test in progress
**Description:** Tyler hunches over his test paper, pencil moving across the page, working through algebraic equations step by step. His brow is furrowed in concentration. The graphing calculator sits beside the paper, screen showing a recent calculation. He writes, pauses, erases with the pencil's pink rubber eraser, writes again. Around him, the classroom is silent except for the scratch of pencils, the tap of calculator buttons, and the occasional deep sigh. Mr. Henderson paces slowly between the rows, hands clasped behind his back.

### Scene 075: Stuck on a Problem
**Time:** 8:50 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Math classroom, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Tyler's test paper showing a difficult multi-step problem. His pencil taps the desk beside the paper — a nervous rhythm. He's worked through several steps in neat-enough handwriting but has hit a wall. He reads the problem again, lips moving slightly. He glances at the ceiling, thinking. His eraser has left gray smudges on the paper. He picks up the calculator, punches in numbers, squints at the result. Tries a different approach, writing tentatively.

### Scene 076: Finishing the Test
**Time:** 9:05 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Math classroom
**Description:** Tyler sets down his pencil, flipping through the two-page test one final time, scanning his answers. He caught one error and fixed it. He sits back in his chair, arms crossing over his chest, a mix of relief and uncertainty on his face. A few students are still working intensely — heads bent, pencils flying. Others are done too, sitting in quiet relief or quiet dread. The clock on the wall above the whiteboard shows 9:05. Ten minutes until the bell.

### Scene 077: Turning in the Test
**Time:** 9:10 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Math classroom, front of room
**Description:** Tyler pushes back his chair and walks to the front of the classroom, placing his completed test face-down on the growing stack on Mr. Henderson's desk. The teacher nods without looking up. Tyler returns to his seat, feeling lighter without the test looming. He slides his phone out under the desk, checking it discreetly — two minutes until the bell anyway. The screen shows new messages in the group chat. A few more students get up to turn in their tests.

### Scene 078: Class Change — Hallway
**Time:** 9:15 AM — hallway
**Setting:** School hallway between classes
**Description:** The bell rings and students pour into the hallway from every classroom door. Tyler joins the flow, navigating the crowded corridor. Lockers slam. Conversations overlap — "How was the test?" echoes multiple times. Tyler passes the water fountain, takes a quick drink, bending down to the chrome arc of water. He straightens up, wipes his mouth with his sleeve. He spots a friend in the crowd and they exchange a quick word: "Test was brutal." "Same." Tyler turns toward the English wing.

### Scene 079: Entering English Class
**Time:** 9:20 AM — classroom
**Setting:** English classroom doorway
**Description:** Tyler enters the English classroom — a different atmosphere from math. The room has posters of famous authors and book covers on the walls: Shakespeare, Toni Morrison, F. Scott Fitzgerald. A bulletin board displays student essays with grades and comments. Bookshelves line one wall, filled with class sets of novels. The desks are arranged in a U-shape for discussion. The teacher, Ms. Taylor — a young Black woman in her late 20s with natural hair and a colorful patterned blouse — writes discussion questions on the whiteboard. Tyler takes his seat in the U-formation, setting his copy of The Great Gatsby on the desk.

### Scene 080: Reading Along in Class
**Time:** 9:30 AM — classroom
**Setting:** English classroom, at desk
**Description:** Tyler follows along in his copy of The Great Gatsby as another student reads a passage aloud. His index finger tracks the text on the page. The book is a school-issued paperback with a worn blue cover, the pages soft from many hands. Some students follow along attentively; others stare out the window or doodle. Tyler underlines a phrase with his pencil — Ms. Taylor told them to annotate. His handwriting in the margins is small and slightly messy. The reading student stumbles on a word and self-corrects.

### Scene 081: Class Discussion
**Time:** 9:45 AM — classroom
**Setting:** English classroom, discussion
**Description:** Ms. Taylor leads a class discussion about themes in the novel. She stands at the front, animated, pointing at the whiteboard where she's written "American Dream — Reality vs. Illusion." Several hands go up. Tyler raises his hand and offers a comment about Gatsby's motivation — it's not profound, but it's on topic. Ms. Taylor nods encouragingly. "Good observation, Tyler." A few students participate; others sit back. The U-shaped desk arrangement allows everyone to see each other during discussion.

### Scene 082: Writing Response
**Time:** 10:00 AM — classroom
**Setting:** English classroom, at desk
**Description:** Tyler writes a short response paragraph in his English notebook — Ms. Taylor assigned a quick-write about a theme from today's reading. He hunches over the notebook, pen moving steadily, pausing to think. His handwriting fills half a page. The Great Gatsby lies open beside the notebook for reference. Other students write too, some faster, some slower. The classroom is quiet except for the sound of pens and the occasional whisper. Ms. Taylor circulates, glancing at student work.

### Scene 083: Passing Period — Hallway
**Time:** 10:15 AM — hallway
**Setting:** School hallway
**Description:** Tyler exits English class into the hallway crush. He checks his phone while walking — a text from Mom: "How was the test?" He types back quickly: "Ok I think" without slowing his pace. The hallway is a river of teenagers: groups clustered by lockers, couples leaning against walls, a kid running late sprinting toward a classroom. Tyler navigates on autopilot, dodging backpacks and elbows. He passes a vending machine — considers it, keeps walking. Next class: US History.

### Scene 084: Entering History Class
**Time:** 10:20 AM — classroom
**Setting:** History classroom entrance
**Description:** Tyler enters the US History classroom. The room has maps covering the walls — a large world map, a US map with Civil War battle markers, and a timeline stretching across one wall from 1776 to the present. The teacher, Mr. Brooks — a middle-aged white man with a salt-and-pepper beard, khaki pants, and a sweater vest over a collared shirt — pulls up a PowerPoint on the projector. The title slide reads "WORLD WAR II: THE PACIFIC THEATER." Desks are in traditional rows. Tyler takes his seat near the back.

### Scene 085: History Lecture — Listening
**Time:** 10:30 AM — classroom
**Setting:** History classroom, at desk
**Description:** Mr. Brooks lectures about the Pacific Theater of World War II, pointing at a projected map showing island-hopping campaigns. His voice carries through the room with practiced authority. Tyler sits at his desk with a spiral notebook open, pen in hand. He takes notes in a combination of writing and shorthand only he can decipher. The PowerPoint shows photos — soldiers, ships, maps with arrows. Some students take diligent notes; a few fight to stay awake in the warm, slightly stuffy classroom.

### Scene 086: Taking Notes
**Time:** 10:40 AM — classroom
**Setting:** History classroom, desk close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Tyler's spiral notebook showing handwritten notes: dates ("1942 — Battle of Midway"), names ("Admiral Nimitz"), bullet points about strategy. His handwriting is somewhat messy but legible in blue pen. In the margin, a small doodle — a rough sketch of an airplane. His pen pauses as he listens to a point Mr. Brooks is making, then resumes writing. The notebook's spiral binding is slightly bent. The desk surface has old graffiti scratched into it — initials and a tiny "2024."

### Scene 087: History — Watching Documentary Clip
**Time:** 10:50 AM — classroom
**Setting:** History classroom, lights dimmed
**Description:** Mr. Brooks dims the overhead fluorescent lights and plays a short documentary clip on the projector — black and white footage of naval battles in the Pacific. The students watch in the darkened room. Tyler leans back in his chair, watching the screen. The footage shows aircraft carriers, planes launching, explosions. A narrator's voice explains the strategic significance. Some students are genuinely engaged; a couple in the back have fallen asleep in the darkness. Tyler's pen rests idle on his notebook.

### Scene 088: Passing Period to Chemistry
**Time:** 11:05 AM — hallway
**Setting:** School hallway
**Description:** Tyler exits History into the bustling hallway. He stops at his locker briefly to swap his history textbook for his chemistry textbook — a thick, heavy book with a colorful cover showing molecular structures. He slams the locker, spins the lock. The hallway noise is loud — it's the period before lunch and energy is rising. Tyler's stomach growls. He passes the cafeteria doors — locked until noon — and the smell of today's lunch drifts through: pizza. He heads to the science wing.

### Scene 089: Entering Chemistry Class
**Time:** 11:10 AM — classroom
**Setting:** Chemistry classroom/lab
**Description:** Tyler enters the Chemistry classroom. Instead of regular desks, the room has black-topped lab tables with built-in sinks and gas hookups, two stools per station. A periodic table poster spans the entire front wall above the whiteboard. Safety goggles hang on hooks by the door in rows — clear plastic with elastic bands. Chemical storage cabinets with yellow hazard labels line one wall. The teacher, Mrs. Patel — an Indian-American woman in her 40s with dark hair in a neat bun, wearing a white lab coat over her blouse — writes lab instructions on the whiteboard in precise handwriting.

### Scene 090: Getting Lab Partner and Goggles
**Time:** 11:15 AM — lab
**Setting:** Chemistry classroom, prep area
**Description:** Tyler grabs a pair of clear safety goggles from the hooks by the door and heads to his assigned lab station. His lab partner, Sophie — a white girl with red hair pulled back in a messy bun, freckles, wearing a flannel shirt — is already seated on her stool. She has the lab worksheet out. "Did you read the pre-lab?" she asks. Tyler hesitates. "Most of it." Sophie gives him a look. They pull on their goggles, the elastic snapping against the backs of their heads. The goggles press awkwardly against Tyler's face.

### Scene 091: Lab Setup — Gathering Materials
**Time:** 11:18 AM — lab
**Setting:** Chemistry lab station
**Description:** Tyler and Sophie set up their lab station following the whiteboard instructions. Tyler carries a beaker rack from the supply shelf to their table — three glass beakers of different sizes nestled in the wire holder. Sophie fills a beaker with water from their station's sink. A Bunsen burner connects to the gas hookup via rubber tubing. They arrange graduated cylinders, glass stirring rods, and the lab worksheet on the black countertop. Mrs. Patel circulates, checking that stations are set up correctly. The classroom buzzes with the clinking of glassware.

### Scene 092: Lab Experiment — Measuring and Heating
**Time:** 11:25 AM — lab
**Setting:** Chemistry lab station, close-up
**Description:** Tyler carefully pours a clear liquid from a larger beaker into a graduated cylinder, reading the meniscus at eye level. Sophie records the measurement on the lab worksheet — 25 mL of solution. Their Bunsen burner is lit, a blue flame flickering. A beaker sits on a wire mesh above the flame, liquid inside beginning to warm. Tyler's goggles fog slightly from the heat. His hands are steady as he pours, conscious of Mrs. Patel's watchful eye. The periodic table poster looms on the wall beyond.

### Scene 093: Lab — Recording Data
**Time:** 11:35 AM — lab
**Setting:** Chemistry lab station
**Description:** Sophie writes data in the lab worksheet while Tyler monitors the heating beaker, watching for the color change Mrs. Patel described. The liquid shifts from clear to a faint blue. "It's changing!" Tyler says, and Sophie looks up to confirm. She records the time. Tyler turns off the Bunsen burner, the blue flame disappearing. They both lean in to examine the beaker's contents. Other lab groups are at various stages — one group's solution has already changed, another is still setting up. The room smells faintly of chemicals and gas.

### Scene 094: Cleaning Up Lab Station
**Time:** 11:45 AM — lab
**Setting:** Chemistry lab station, sink area
**Description:** Tyler rinses beakers and graduated cylinders at the lab station sink, water flowing over the glassware. Sophie wipes down the black countertop with a damp paper towel. They return the Bunsen burner to its storage spot and hang their safety goggles back on the hooks by the door. The lab worksheet, now complete with data and observations in Sophie's neat handwriting and Tyler's rougher contributions, sits on the counter ready to turn in. Mrs. Patel collects worksheets as students clean up.

### Scene 095: End of Morning — Lunch Bell Anticipation
**Time:** 11:55 AM — classroom/hallway
**Setting:** Chemistry classroom exit
**Description:** Tyler sits on his stool at the clean lab station, staring at the clock on the wall. 11:55 AM. Five minutes until lunch. His stomach has been growling for the last twenty minutes. Sophie packs up her things. Students around the room are similarly clock-watching, conversations drifting to food. The chemistry textbook sits untouched — Mrs. Patel didn't assign reading today. Tyler drums his fingers on the black countertop. The bell is going to ring and he is going to be first in the cafeteria line.

---

## PART 7: LUNCH (12:00 PM - 12:40 PM)

### Scene 096: Locker Stop Before Lunch
**Time:** 12:00 PM — hallway
**Setting:** At locker
**Description:** The bell rings and Tyler moves fast. He's at his locker in under a minute, spinning the combination with practiced speed. He drops his chemistry textbook inside, slams the locker, and pockets only his phone and the $5 lunch money. The hallway surges with students all heading the same direction — toward the cafeteria. The lunch bell has triggered a migration. Tyler joins the stream, walking with purpose. No books, no backpack — just a hungry teenager heading to food.

### Scene 097: Cafeteria Entrance
**Time:** 12:02 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Cafeteria entrance, wide view
**Description:** Tyler enters the school cafeteria — a large rectangular room with high ceilings and industrial lighting. Long rectangular tables with attached fold-out benches fill the space in rows. The noise is immediate and overwhelming: hundreds of students talking, laughing, chairs scraping. A lunch line forms along the left wall where cafeteria workers in hairnets and blue gloves serve from stainless steel trays behind a glass sneeze guard. The smell of cafeteria pizza fills the air — greasy, warm, familiar. A menu board on the wall reads: "TODAY: PIZZA / CHICKEN NUGGETS / SALAD BAR."

### Scene 098: Getting a Tray in Line
**Time:** 12:04 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch line, start
**Description:** Tyler grabs a brown plastic tray from a stack at the beginning of the lunch line and slides it along the metal counter rails. The line moves slowly. Ahead, cafeteria workers — mostly middle-aged women in white aprons and hairnets — stand behind the glass partition, serving with large metal spoons. The counter displays: a pan of rectangular cafeteria pizza slices, a tray of golden chicken nuggets, containers of side dishes — canned green beans, corn, a fruit cup. A refrigerated cooler at the end holds milk cartons and juice boxes. Tyler eyes the pizza.

### Scene 099: Getting Food
**Time:** 12:07 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch line, serving area
**Description:** Tyler slides his tray along the metal counter. A cafeteria worker places a rectangular slice of pizza on his tray — the cheese glistens under the fluorescent lights, the crust soft and slightly doughy. He points at the chicken nuggets too — the worker adds a small pile of golden nuggets beside the pizza. He grabs a small container of ranch dressing from a bin. From the cooler at the end, he grabs a carton of chocolate milk — the small rectangular cardboard kind with a pointed fold-out spout. His tray is loaded.

### Scene 100: Paying for Lunch
**Time:** 12:09 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch checkout register
**Description:** Tyler reaches the lunch cashier at the end of the line — an older woman with reading glasses and a small cash register on a counter. He hands over the crumpled $5 bill from his pocket. The register beeps. She hands back $2.25 in change — a dollar bill, a quarter. Tyler stuffs the change into his jeans pocket, balances his tray with both hands, and turns to scan the cafeteria for his friends. The tray is warm from the pizza, slightly wobbly with the chocolate milk carton threatening to slide.

### Scene 101: Finding the Table
**Time:** 12:10 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Cafeteria seating area, scanning
**Description:** Tyler stands at the edge of the seating area, scanning over heads and trays for his friends' table. The cafeteria is organized in invisible social geography: the athletes near the windows, the theater kids in the corner, the quiet kids near the back. He spots Jake waving from their usual table — middle section, near a support pillar. Marcus is already there too, along with Sophie from chemistry class and another friend. Tyler navigates through the crowded rows, tray held high to avoid collisions, weaving between benches and backpacks.

### Scene 102: Sitting Down with Friends
**Time:** 12:11 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch table
**Description:** Tyler sets his tray down at the table and swings his leg over the attached bench, sitting down. His friends are already settled: Jake with a tray of chicken nuggets and a Gatorade he brought from home; Marcus — a stocky white kid with buzzed hair and a football jersey — with pizza and a bag of chips; Sophie with a salad from the salad bar. "How was the math test?" is the first thing everyone asks each other. Tyler picks up his pizza slice. "I think I passed. Maybe." The group commiserates.

### Scene 103: Eating Cafeteria Pizza
**Time:** 12:15 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch table, close-up on food
**Description:** Tyler takes a large bite of cafeteria pizza, cheese stretching from the slice to his mouth. The pizza is standard school fare — decent but clearly mass-produced, the cheese slightly rubbery, the sauce sweet. He dips a chicken nugget into the ranch dressing and eats it in one bite. His chocolate milk carton is open, the fold-out spout poked through. The tray holds the remaining food: pizza crust in progress, nuggets diminishing, ranch dressing cup. Cafeteria background noise fills the air. Tyler eats with the urgency of a teenager who just survived a math test.

### Scene 104: Lunch Table Conversation
**Time:** 12:20 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch table, friend group
**Description:** The friend group talks and laughs at the lunch table. Sophie shows something on her phone screen — everyone leans in to look. It's a funny video. Marcus nearly chokes on his pizza laughing. Jake makes a joke and Tyler grins. The table is scattered with trays, food wrappers, and phones. The conversation shifts rapidly between topics: the math test, a meme someone saw, weekend plans, whether the football game is worth going to. Normal high school lunch energy — loud, chaotic, comfortable.

### Scene 105: Trading Snacks
**Time:** 12:25 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch table
**Description:** Tyler trades his remaining chicken nuggets to Jake for Jake's bag of chips — a small bag of Doritos. The exchange happens wordlessly, a rehearsed lunch table economy. Tyler tears open the chip bag and crunches Doritos between bites of pizza. Marcus offers Sophie his fruit cup; she declines. Food bartering at the teen lunch table — an ancient social ritual. Tyler's chocolate milk is nearly empty, the carton dented from squeezing.

### Scene 106: Checking Phone at Lunch
**Time:** 12:30 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch table, Tyler on phone
**Description:** Tyler checks his phone between bites, scrolling through notifications. A text from Mom: "How was the test?" He types a quick reply: "Ok I think." Instagram shows a few new stories from classmates. The group chat has new messages he missed during class. Sophie makes a comment about everyone being on their phones — "We're right here, guys." Tyler and Jake look up sheepishly, pocket their phones for about thirty seconds, then slowly drift back to the screens. Modern teen dining.

### Scene 107: Finishing and Cleaning Up
**Time:** 12:35 PM — cafeteria
**Setting:** Lunch table and trash area
**Description:** Tyler's tray is mostly empty — a pizza crust he won't eat, an empty chip bag, the crushed chocolate milk carton, a used ranch cup. The warning bell sounds — five minutes until next period. The group starts gathering things. Tyler picks up his tray, carries it to the trash/dish return area, scrapes the pizza crust into the large garbage can, and places the brown tray on the conveyor belt that disappears through a window to the dish-washing area. He wipes his hands on his jeans. Time for afternoon classes.

## PART 8: AFTERNOON CLASSES (12:45 PM - 3:15 PM)

### Scene 108: Gym Class — Locker Room Arrival
**Time:** 12:50 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room entrance
**Description:** Tyler enters the boys' locker room for gym class — fifth period. The room is long and narrow, rows of gray metal lockers with built-in combination locks, wooden benches between the rows. The air smells of sweat, cheap body spray, and damp concrete. The floor is gray tile, slightly wet in places. Tyler goes to his assigned gym locker, spins the combo, and opens it. Inside: a folded gray t-shirt with the school tiger logo, red athletic shorts, and a pair of old running shoes. He starts changing.

### Scene 109: Removing School Clothes
**Time:** 12:53 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room, at bench
**Description:** Tyler sits on the wooden bench between locker rows, pulling off his white Vans sneakers and setting them on the floor. He unbuttons his flannel shirt, shrugs it off, then pulls the black graphic tee over his head. Both shirts get stuffed into the gym locker on the shelf above the hook. His jeans follow — unbuttoned, stepped out of, folded loosely and shoved in on top. He stands in boxers and socks on the cold tile floor, the locker room air cool against his skin. Other boys change around him, locker doors clanging, conversations overlapping.

### Scene 110: Putting on Gym Clothes
**Time:** 12:54 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room, at bench
**Description:** Tyler pulls on the gray school gym t-shirt — "JEFFERSON TIGERS" in orange block letters across the chest — tugging the hem down. He steps into the red athletic shorts, the nylon fabric swishing as he pulls them up. The gym uniform is standard issue: every student in the same gray-and-red combination. Tyler adjusts the elastic waistband and looks down at himself — the shirt is slightly too big, the shorts slightly too short, the universal awkwardness of school-issued athletic wear.

### Scene 111: Lacing Up Gym Shoes
**Time:** 12:55 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room, at bench
**Description:** Tyler sits back down on the wooden bench and pulls on a pair of old running shoes — worn-out New Balances his dad gave him, the soles flattened, the white leather scuffed gray. He laces them up properly for once — gym class requires actual running, unlike the loose-laced Vans. He double-knots the left shoe. He stands, bounces once on the balls of his feet to test the fit, then slams the gym locker shut with a metallic bang. The combination lock clicks into place.

### Scene 112: Entering the Gymnasium
**Time:** 12:58 PM — gymnasium
**Setting:** School gymnasium, wide view
**Description:** Tyler walks through the double doors from the locker room into the gymnasium — a large open space with a high ceiling, hardwood basketball court with painted lines, two hoops at either end, retractable bleachers along both walls. Fluorescent lights hang from the ceiling in industrial fixtures. The gym teacher, Coach Davis — a stocky white man in his 40s with a buzz cut, wearing a polo shirt, athletic shorts, and a whistle on a lanyard — stands at center court with a clipboard. Students in gym clothes gather around. "Today we're playing basketball," he announces. Tyler grins.

### Scene 113: Basketball — Warm-Up
**Time:** 1:05 PM — gymnasium
**Setting:** Gym, basketball court
**Description:** Tyler jogs laps around the gym with the rest of the class for warm-up, sneakers squeaking on the polished hardwood floor. Then they stretch — Tyler touches his toes, feeling the pull in his hamstrings. Coach Davis bounces a basketball at center court, the rhythmic thud echoing. After stretching, students shoot around at the side hoops, waiting for teams. Tyler takes a shot from the free-throw line — it clangs off the rim. He gets his own rebound and tries again. This time it swishes through the net. He pumps a small fist.

### Scene 114: Basketball — Playing
**Time:** 1:15 PM — gymnasium
**Setting:** Gym, basketball game
**Description:** Tyler plays basketball with his class, divided into teams with colored pinnies — Tyler wears an orange mesh pinnie over his gym shirt. He dribbles the ball up the court, sneakers squeaking sharply on the hardwood. He passes to a teammate near the basket, cuts toward the hoop, receives the return pass, and goes for a layup — the ball rolls around the rim and drops in. He jogs back on defense, hands up. Sweat forms on his forehead. The gym echoes with shouts, the bounce of the ball, squeaking shoes. Tyler is fully alive in this moment, grinning.

### Scene 115: Basketball — Taking a Break
**Time:** 1:30 PM — gymnasium
**Setting:** Gym sideline, bleachers
**Description:** Tyler sits on the pulled-out bleachers during a substitution break, catching his breath. His gray gym shirt has dark sweat patches. He grabs a water bottle from beside his gym bag and takes a long drink, water dripping down his chin. Other students sit nearby, some winded, some chatting. The game continues on the court — the ball bouncing, sneakers squeaking. Coach Davis blows his whistle at a foul. Tyler watches the game, itching to get back in, legs bouncing with restless energy.

### Scene 116: Gym Locker Room — Changing Back
**Time:** 1:40 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room, post-gym
**Description:** Tyler enters the boys' locker room after gym class, sweaty and flushed. He opens his gym locker and pulls off the damp gray gym shirt, dropping it on the bench. The red athletic shorts follow. He pulls on his jeans, the denim stiff and cool against his sweaty legs. The black graphic tee goes over his head, then the flannel shirt layered on top, sleeves pushed up. The gym clothes go back in the locker, slightly damp and crumpled. The locker room smells like a teenager factory.

### Scene 117: Gym Locker Room — Deodorant and Hair
**Time:** 1:42 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room, at bench
**Description:** Tyler grabs a can of spray deodorant from his gym locker shelf and gives each armpit a quick spray — a courtesy measure since there's no time for a shower. The chemical-fresh scent cuts through the locker room funk. He sets the can back and leans toward the small magnetic mirror inside his locker door, running both hands through his hair, which is damp with sweat and sticking to his forehead. He pushes it to the side, tries to shake it into shape. Good enough.

### Scene 118: Gym Locker Room — Shoes and Done
**Time:** 1:43 PM — locker room
**Setting:** Boys' locker room, at bench
**Description:** Tyler sits on the wooden bench and pulls on his white Vans sneakers, shoving his feet in without untying them. He kicks the old New Balance gym shoes into the bottom of the locker. He stands, checks that he has everything — phone in pocket, school clothes on — and slams the gym locker shut with a metallic clang. The combination lock clicks into place. He heads toward the locker room exit, joining the stream of boys heading back into the school hallways.

### Scene 119: Walking to Art Class
**Time:** 1:50 PM — hallway
**Setting:** School hallway
**Description:** Tyler walks down the hallway to his next class — Art, in the far wing of the school. He's slightly flushed from gym still, hair a little wild from sweat. He passes a restroom and ducks in quickly to splash water on his face and fix his hair in the mirror — a 30-second detour. Back in the hallway, he passes a bulletin board covered in announcements: club sign-ups, a lost-and-found notice, the school newspaper pinned up. The art room is at the end of the hall, identifiable by colorful student murals painted around the doorframe.

### Scene 120: Entering Art Class
**Time:** 1:55 PM — art room
**Setting:** Art classroom entrance
**Description:** Tyler enters the art classroom — a distinctly different space from the rest of the school. Large rectangular tables replace desks, surfaces covered in dried paint splatters and carved initials. Sinks with paint stains line one wall. Student artwork is displayed everywhere: paintings pinned to corkboards, ceramic pieces on shelves, sketches tacked to the walls. Natural light streams through large windows. Art supplies fill shelves: jars of brushes, stacked boxes of colored pencils, bottles of paint, rolls of paper. The art teacher, Ms. Kim — a Korean-American woman in her 30s with paint-stained hands and a canvas apron — sets up the day's assignment on the front table.

### Scene 121: Drawing Assignment
**Time:** 2:05 PM — art room
**Setting:** Art classroom, at table
**Description:** Tyler sits at a large art table with three other students, working on a drawing assignment — a perspective drawing of a building exterior. He has a large sheet of white drawing paper, a set of drawing pencils of various hardnesses (2H, HB, 2B), a ruler, and an eraser. He works on the sketch, using the ruler to get straight lines for the building edges. His technique is average but earnest — not an art prodigy, but he doesn't hate the class. His tongue sticks out slightly as he concentrates on a difficult vanishing point.

### Scene 122: Working on Drawing — Detail
**Time:** 2:15 PM — art room
**Setting:** Art classroom, close-up on hands and paper
**Description:** Close-up of Tyler's hands sketching with a pencil on the white drawing paper. The building outline is taking shape — he's added windows, a door, and the beginning of shading. Eraser shavings scatter across the table surface. He switches to a softer pencil (2B) for darker lines and shadows. His drawing isn't masterful but shows effort — the perspective lines mostly converge where they should. Ms. Kim pauses behind him, leans down, and points to a line. "Try extending this to the vanishing point." Tyler adjusts. Colored pencil drawings and a ceramic vase from other students' projects are visible at the end of the table.

### Scene 123: Last Period — Study Hall
**Time:** 2:40 PM — classroom
**Setting:** Study hall classroom
**Description:** Tyler in study hall — last period of the day. A plain classroom repurposed for the purpose, desks scattered in loose rows. Some students do homework diligently, heads bent over textbooks. Others whisper conversations. A few have their heads on their desks, sleeping. The study hall monitor — a younger male teacher who clearly drew the short straw — sits at the front desk, occasionally looking up from his laptop. Tyler has his history notebook out, working on the reading questions assigned earlier. He wants to finish so he has less homework tonight.

### Scene 124: Doing Homework in Study Hall
**Time:** 2:50 PM — study hall
**Setting:** Study hall desk, close-up
**Description:** Tyler writes answers in his spiral notebook for the history reading questions, pen moving quickly. He glances at his history textbook open beside the notebook, skimming a paragraph for an answer. The questions are about the Pacific Theater — material covered in today's lecture and the textbook chapter. He fills in three answers in quick succession. Getting this done now means more gaming time tonight. His handwriting gets progressively sloppier as urgency outweighs neatness.

### Scene 125: Clock Watching
**Time:** 3:05 PM — study hall
**Setting:** Study hall classroom, eyes on clock
**Description:** Tyler's gaze drifts to the round clock on the wall above the door. 3:05 PM. Ten minutes until the final bell. He's finished the history worksheet. He leans back in his chair, pen tapping the desk. The anticipation of the school day ending is nearly tangible. He checks his phone under the desk — a text from Jake: "soccer after school?" Tyler types back: "yeah." He glances at the clock again. 3:06. Time has never moved this slowly.

### Scene 126: Final Bell
**Time:** 3:15 PM — study hall
**Setting:** Study hall classroom
**Description:** The final bell rings — a long, beautiful electronic buzz. Students spring from their seats like coiled springs released. Chairs scrape, books slam, conversations erupt. Tyler shoves his notebook into his backpack in one motion and stands. The study hall monitor calls "Have a good afternoon" to no one in particular — students are already streaming out the door. Tyler's the third one into the hallway. The school day is over. The energy shift is immediate and electric.

---

## PART 9: AFTER SCHOOL (3:15 PM - 4:00 PM)

### Scene 127: Hallway Rush
**Time:** 3:16 PM — hallway
**Setting:** School hallway, post-bell chaos
**Description:** Tyler joins the flood of students surging through the hallway. Everyone moves toward exits, lockers, buses, the parking lot. Locker doors slam in rapid succession like gunfire. Friends find each other, plans are shouted over the noise. Tyler weaves through the crowd with the practiced agility of someone who does this five days a week. His flannel shirt flaps open as he walks. The hallway is at maximum volume — pure teenage energy unleashed.

### Scene 128: Getting Books from Locker
**Time:** 3:18 PM — locker
**Setting:** At locker
**Description:** Tyler at his locker for the last time today, spinning the combination fast. He grabs the books he needs for homework: his math textbook (to review after the test for corrections), The Great Gatsby, and his history textbook. He shoves them into the black Jansport backpack, which sags under the collective weight. He considers leaving the history book — the worksheet is done — but keeps it. He slams the locker shut, clicks the lock. Done for the day.

### Scene 129: Meeting Jake at Side Exit
**Time:** 3:22 PM — school exit
**Setting:** School side exit, near athletic fields
**Description:** Tyler meets Jake at the side exit near the athletic fields. Both have heavy backpacks on, both look relieved the school day is over. They push through the metal door into the afternoon sunlight — bright and warm for October. The athletic fields stretch behind the school: a football field with white-lined yard markers, a running track circling it, soccer fields beyond, and a few practice areas. "Soccer field?" Jake asks. "Let's go." They head down the concrete path toward the open fields.

### Scene 130: Walking to the Soccer Field
**Time:** 3:25 PM — exterior
**Setting:** School athletic fields
**Description:** Tyler and Jake walk across the school athletic complex, backpacks bouncing. The football team is already on the main field — players in pads and helmets running drills, a coach blowing a whistle. Cross-country runners jog past in a pack. Cheerleaders practice near the gym entrance. Tyler and Jake head past all of it to an open grass soccer field at the far end where a handful of friends are already gathering. The afternoon sun is warm and golden, casting long shadows across the green grass.

### Scene 131: Dropping Backpacks — Getting Ready
**Time:** 3:30 PM — soccer field
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline
**Description:** Tyler drops his heavy backpack on the grass at the edge of the soccer field, next to a growing pile of other backpacks and jackets. He rolls up the sleeves of his flannel shirt. About eight kids are gathering — a mix of guys and a couple of girls, all casual, no uniforms. Someone has a soccer ball and starts juggling it. "Teams?" Jake asks. They do a quick casual split — no captains, just "you four, us four." Tyler tightens his sneaker laces for once. The grass is slightly damp, autumn leaves scattered at the field edges.

### Scene 132: Playing Pickup Soccer
**Time:** 3:40 PM — soccer field
**Setting:** Soccer field, mid-game
**Description:** Tyler plays pickup soccer with friends on the open field. No goals, just backpacks as goalposts. Tyler dribbles the ball forward, feet moving the ball in short controlled touches across the grass. He fakes left, cuts right, passes to Jake who takes a shot — it sails between the backpack goalposts. Tyler raises his arms in celebration. The game is informal and loose — lots of laughter, some trash talk, no one keeping careful score. The October afternoon is perfect for this: cool air, warm sun, the freedom of after school.

### Scene 133: Taking a Water Break
**Time:** 3:50 PM — soccer field
**Setting:** Soccer field sideline
**Description:** Tyler jogs to the sideline, catching his breath. He grabs his water bottle from the side pocket of his backpack and takes a long drink, water spilling down his chin. His face is flushed, hair messy and slightly sweaty. He sits on the grass, legs stretched out, catching his breath. The game continues without him for a rotation. The school building is visible in the background, the flag still snapping on its pole. The sky is blue with a few wispy clouds. Tyler feels good — the math test stress is gone, replaced by endorphins.

### Scene 134: Checking Phone — Ride Home
**Time:** 3:55 PM — soccer field
**Setting:** Sideline, sitting on grass
**Description:** Tyler checks his phone while resting. A text from Mom: "Bus home or need a ride?" He texts back: "Can u get me at 4:15? At soccer field." She replies with a thumbs-up emoji. He also checks the group chat — Marcus is at home already, complaining about homework. Tyler pockets the phone and jogs back into the game for one more round, the ball already in play. The afternoon sun is starting to drop lower, shadows lengthening across the grass.

### Scene 135: Game Winding Down
**Time:** 4:05 PM — soccer field
**Setting:** Soccer field, slowing down
**Description:** The pickup soccer game winds down as players peel off one by one — rides arrive, buses to catch, homework looming. Tyler and Jake and a couple others keep kicking the ball around casually, no longer really playing a game, just passing and shooting. Tyler traps a pass with his chest, lets it drop to his feet, takes a casual shot at the backpack goals. Wide right. He laughs at himself. The field is emptier now, just a handful of kids left.

### Scene 136: Mom's Car in the Parking Lot
**Time:** 4:15 PM — parking lot
**Setting:** School parking lot
**Description:** Tyler walks through the school parking lot toward the parent pickup area, backpack on both shoulders now, slightly sweaty and grass-stained. His mom's car — a silver Toyota Camry, a few years old with a small dent in the rear bumper — pulls into the pickup lane. Tyler jogs over, opens the back door to toss his heavy backpack in, then climbs into the passenger seat. The car interior is clean, a pine air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror. Karen smiles at him from the driver's seat. "Fun?" "Yeah."

---

## PART 10: RIDE HOME & ARRIVING (4:15 PM - 4:30 PM)

### Scene 137: In Mom's Car
**Time:** 4:15 PM — car interior
**Setting:** Toyota Camry, passenger seat
**Description:** Tyler sits in the passenger seat as Karen drives home through the small-town streets. She wears the green cardigan and jeans from this morning. "How was school?" "Fine." "How was the math test?" "I think I did okay." The standard parent-teen car dialogue. Through the car windows, the small town passes: the diner with its neon sign, the hardware store, houses with front porches and American flags. The radio plays softly — a classic rock station Karen likes. Tyler leans his head against the window, tired but content.

### Scene 138: Pulling into the Driveway
**Time:** 4:25 PM — exterior
**Setting:** Home driveway
**Description:** The silver Camry pulls into the driveway of the family's two-story house. Tyler sees it as always: white vinyl siding, blue shutters around the windows, a covered front porch with two chairs, a basketball hoop mounted above the garage door. Autumn leaves — orange, red, yellow — scatter across the front lawn and the concrete driveway. Dad's truck isn't home yet — he works until 5:00. Lily's bedroom window upstairs shows a light on. Tyler grabs his heavy backpack from the back seat and pushes out of the car.

### Scene 139: Entering the House
**Time:** 4:27 PM — front entryway
**Setting:** Front entryway
**Description:** Tyler pushes through the front door into the house, dropping his backpack with a heavy thud at the foot of the stairs. The entryway opens to the living room on the right — brown sectional couch, TV on the wall, a bookshelf with family photos and Karen's library books. Stairs go up to the left. Lily's pink sneakers and backpack are by the door — she's home from the middle school bus. Tyler can hear music from upstairs — Lily in her room. "I'm home!" he calls to no one specific. The house smells faintly of laundry detergent and the morning's coffee.

### Scene 140: Quick Hello to Lily
**Time:** 4:28 PM — staircase/hallway
**Setting:** Bottom of stairs
**Description:** Tyler starts up the stairs. Lily appears at the top, leaning over the banister. "Mom said to tell you to start your homework." Tyler ignores this completely. "Did you eat all the Doritos?" he asks instead. Lily smirks. "Maybe." Tyler groans and continues up the stairs past her. "You're the worst," he says without heat. "You smell like sweat," she replies, disappearing back into her room. The hallway family photos observe the exchange silently.

---

## PART 11: AFTER SCHOOL AT HOME (4:30 PM - 6:00 PM)

### Scene 141: Removing School Clothes
**Time:** 4:30 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom
**Description:** Tyler enters his bedroom and immediately starts shedding school clothes. The flannel shirt comes off first, tossed onto the desk chair. Jeans next — unbuttoned, stepped out of, kicked toward the laundry basket (they land three feet short). His sneakers get kicked off by the door, landing on their sides on the tan carpet. The relief of removing school clothes after a long day is visible in his loosening posture.

### Scene 142: Pulling on Sweatpants
**Time:** 4:31 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at dresser
**Description:** Tyler opens a dresser drawer and pulls out gray sweatpants, stepping into them and pulling the elastic waistband up. He keeps the black graphic tee on — it's comfortable enough for home. He stands in the middle of his messy room in sweatpants and a band t-shirt, barefoot on the tan carpet. Home mode activated. The posters on the walls, the desk lamp, the unmade bed — everything familiar and comfortable after a full school day.

### Scene 143: Grabbing Chips from the Pantry
**Time:** 4:35 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, pantry
**Description:** Tyler pads downstairs to the kitchen in sweatpants and bare feet. He opens the pantry door — a tall cabinet beside the fridge — and scans the shelves: cereal boxes, canned soup, crackers, chips. He grabs a bag of Doritos (not all gone after all — Lily lied). The bag crinkles loudly as he pulls it from the shelf. Karen calls from the living room: "Don't spoil your appetite — dinner's at six." "I won't," Tyler says, already opening the bag and eating a chip.

### Scene 144: Grabbing a Drink from the Fridge
**Time:** 4:36 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, at fridge
**Description:** Tyler opens the fridge door, the interior light illuminating bottles, containers, and leftovers. He grabs a can of Mountain Dew from the door shelf, the green can cold against his palm. The fridge door swings shut with a soft thud. He tucks the Doritos bag under his arm, Mountain Dew in hand, and heads back upstairs to his room, bare feet padding on the linoleum then the carpeted stairs. Snack mission accomplished.

### Scene 145: Setting Up for Gaming
**Time:** 4:40 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk area
**Description:** Tyler sits at his desk, setting up for a gaming session. He opens his laptop — the screen wakes to show his desktop wallpaper (a game screenshot). He plugs in his gaming headset — a black headset with green accents and a flip-down microphone — settling it over his ears. He opens Discord on the laptop, seeing which friends are online. Jake is already in a voice channel. Marcus is showing "In Game." Tyler clicks to join the voice channel, and Jake's voice crackles through the headset: "Took you long enough." Tyler grins and launches the game.

### Scene 146: Gaming — In Action
**Time:** 4:50 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at laptop
**Description:** Tyler plays an online shooter game on his laptop, hunched forward in the desk chair, fingers clicking rapidly on the keyboard and mouse. The laptop screen shows the game — first-person perspective, a digital battlefield. His headset mic is flipped down, and he talks to friends: "He's behind the wall — cover me!" His expression is intense, focused, jaw clenched. The Doritos bag sits open beside the laptop, orange crumbs on the desk surface. The Mountain Dew can is half empty, condensation ring marking the desk. His room is dim — the blinds are still open but the afternoon light is fading.

### Scene 147: Gaming — Celebrating a Win
**Time:** 5:05 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Tyler throws both arms up in triumph, spinning slightly in the desk chair. "Let's go! Did you see that?" he shouts into the headset mic. The game screen shows "VICTORY" in large letters. Jake's voice cheers through the headset. Tyler leans back in the chair, grinning wide, the kind of pure teenage joy that comes from winning a round with friends. He grabs a handful of Doritos to celebrate, orange dust coating his fingers. The headset sits slightly crooked on his head.

### Scene 148: Saying Goodbye on Discord
**Time:** 5:15 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk
**Description:** Tyler minimizes the game with visible reluctance. "Gotta do homework, guys. Back later." Groans from the Discord channel — Jake protests, Marcus calls him a quitter. Tyler grins but stays firm. He clicks to leave the voice channel, the familiar disconnect sound playing through the headset. The game window sits minimized in the taskbar. The laptop screen shows the Discord interface, friends' avatars going dim. He takes off the headset, hanging it on the desk chair back. The room is suddenly quiet — the contrast between gaming chaos and silence is jarring.

### Scene 149: Unpacking Homework
**Time:** 5:17 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk
**Description:** Tyler pulls his heavy backpack from beside the desk and unzips it, pulling out textbooks and notebooks. The desk transforms from gaming station to homework station: The Great Gatsby lands on the surface, followed by his English notebook and a pencil. The Doritos bag gets pushed to the side, crumbs and all. He arranges the books, opens the notebook to a fresh page, and stares at the English assignment with the enthusiasm of someone facing a dentist visit. The laptop screen glows behind the textbooks, tempting him back to the game.

### Scene 150: Reading for English Class
**Time:** 5:20 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Tyler reads The Great Gatsby, the school-issued paperback open on the desk. He leans back in his chair with the book held in both hands, feet propped on an open desk drawer. A pencil rests behind his ear — Ms. Taylor expects annotations. He reads a paragraph, pauses, and makes a small mark in the margin. The desk lamp is now on — a simple adjustable lamp with a metal shade — casting a warm cone of light on the pages. His phone sits face-down on the desk. He reads slowly, not because he can't — because he's tired.

### Scene 151: Writing English Answers
**Time:** 5:35 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk close-up
**Description:** Tyler hunches over his English notebook, writing answers to comprehension questions about the reading. His handwriting is quick and slightly messy, filling half-lines rather than full sentences where possible. The Great Gatsby lies open beside the notebook for reference. His laptop browser is open to SparkNotes in another tab — he tells himself it's for "supplementary understanding," not cheating. The pencil moves quickly. The Doritos bag is now mostly empty, orange fingerprint smudges visible on the notebook page corner. The desk lamp creates a warm island of light in the dimming room.

### Scene 152: Math Review
**Time:** 5:50 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk
**Description:** Tyler switches to math — not homework per se, but reviewing the test material since Mr. Henderson always goes over the test next class. He flips through the math textbook, looking at the types of problems that were on the test. The graphing calculator sits beside the book. He reworks one problem he remembers being stuck on, pencil scratching on notebook paper. He gets the same answer he put on the test, which is either reassuring or doubly concerning. The Mountain Dew can is empty. Evening light has faded outside the window — the room relies on the desk lamp now.

### Scene 153: Phone Distraction
**Time:** 5:55 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at desk
**Description:** Tyler's phone buzzes on the desk, screen lighting up with a notification. He picks it up — just a quick check. Five minutes later he's deep in a TikTok scroll, the math textbook forgotten and open to the same page. Videos play silently (his earbuds are out), his thumb swiping upward in a rhythmic, hypnotic motion. He laughs at a video, saves another, checks Instagram stories. The homework sits patiently on the desk. This is the infinite scroll, the gravity well of teenage attention. It takes Mom's voice from downstairs to break the spell.

### Scene 154: Mom Calling for Dinner
**Time:** 6:00 PM — bedroom, voice from below
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, looking toward door
**Description:** "Tyler! Lily! Dinner's ready!" Karen's voice carries up the stairs, cutting through the quiet of the bedroom. Tyler looks up from his phone, startled out of the scroll. He checks the time — 6:00 PM already. He sets the phone down, closes the math textbook, and pushes back from the desk. He glances at the homework spread — English is done, math review is mostly done, history was finished at study hall. Good enough. He pulls on socks (the floor downstairs is cold) and heads out of his room, stomach growling.

## PART 12: FAMILY DINNER (6:00 PM - 6:45 PM)

### Scene 155: Coming Downstairs for Dinner
**Time:** 6:02 PM — staircase
**Setting:** Staircase, descending
**Description:** Tyler comes down the stairs in his sweatpants and socked feet. Lily exits her room at the same time, and there's a brief, unspoken race to the bottom — Lily wins because she's smaller and faster on the stairs. The smell of dinner fills the house: something savory and warm. Tyler can hear Dad's voice in the kitchen — Mike is home from the factory, his deep voice carrying. The front hallway is darker now, the living room TV is on with the evening news playing to no one.

### Scene 156: Dad Home from Work
**Time:** 6:03 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, family gathering
**Description:** Tyler enters the kitchen. Dad — Mike — sits at the round table, still in his work clothes: a flannel shirt and sturdy jeans, steel-toed boots unlaced. Mike is a broad-shouldered white man in his mid-40s with thinning hair and a tired but warm face, the weariness of a factory shift settling in. A can of beer sits in front of him. "Hey, bud. How was school?" "Good. I think I did okay on the math test." Mike nods. "That's my man." Karen stirs a pot on the stove. The kitchen is warm and steamy.

### Scene 157: Setting Plates on the Table
**Time:** 6:05 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, cabinets to table
**Description:** Tyler grabs plates from the cabinet above the counter — four white ceramic dinner plates stacked together. He carries them to the round wooden table, setting one at each of the four spots, the ceramic clinking softly against the wood. Lily fills four glasses with water from the fridge pitcher. Mike sets his beer aside and clears the table of his work keys and wallet. The table transforms from cluttered to ready.

### Scene 158: Setting Silverware
**Time:** 6:06 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Karen asks Tyler to get forks and knives too. He pulls open the silverware drawer — the utensils rattle and clatter inside — and grabs a handful of forks and knives. He distributes them at each place setting, the silverware landing on the table with small metallic clinks. A fork, a knife at each plate. Not perfectly aligned, but functional. A family assembly line of dinner preparation, each member contributing.

### Scene 159: Mom Serving Dinner
**Time:** 6:08 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table, food arriving
**Description:** Karen carries a large casserole dish to the table using oven mitts — tonight it's a ground beef and noodle casserole with a golden-brown cheese topping, a Midwest staple. A bowl of steamed green beans follows, and a basket of dinner rolls. The food steams on the table. "Careful, it's hot," Karen says, setting the casserole on a trivet. The table is set with four places, the overhead kitchen light casting warm light on the spread. Mike reaches for a roll before Karen even sits down, and she gives him a look.

### Scene 160: Family Seated and Serving
**Time:** 6:10 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table, all seated
**Description:** All four family members sit around the round kitchen table. Tyler uses a large serving spoon to scoop a generous helping of beef noodle casserole onto his plate — the cheese stretches and a puff of steam rises. He adds green beans reluctantly, only because Karen is watching. A dinner roll goes on the plate's edge. Lily serves herself a smaller portion. Mike has a mountain of casserole on his plate already. Karen serves herself last, settling into her chair with a tired but satisfied expression. The overhead light illuminates the family meal.

### Scene 161: Eating Dinner
**Time:** 6:15 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table, eating
**Description:** The family eats dinner together. Tyler forks large bites of cheesy beef casserole into his mouth — the noodles are soft, the ground beef seasoned, the cheese melty and golden. He tears a dinner roll in half and uses it to push food onto his fork. Mike eats steadily, work appetite fueling large portions. Lily picks at her green beans, rearranging them on the plate. Karen eats between sips of water, the first to initiate conversation. The clinking of silverware on plates punctuates the quiet chewing.

### Scene 162: Dinner Conversation — Dad's Day
**Time:** 6:20 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Mike tells the family about his day at the factory — something about a machine breakdown on the line and the new guy who didn't know how to fix it. He gestures with his fork while talking, a habit Karen has tried to correct for years. Tyler listens with half-attention, nodding at appropriate moments. Lily interrupts to ask if she can go to a friend's sleepover this weekend. Karen redirects: "Let Dad finish." Mike waves it off — "She can go." The conversation is comfortable, overlapping, the rhythm of a family that eats together regularly.

### Scene 163: Dinner Conversation — Tyler's Test
**Time:** 6:25 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Karen asks Tyler more about the math test. "What kind of problems were on it?" Tyler shrugs. "Algebra stuff. Equations. I think I got most of them." Mike weighs in: "You studied, right?" "Yeah." (He studied somewhat.) Lily chimes in: "I got a 98 on my math quiz." She says it casually, which makes it worse. Tyler shoots her a look. "Nobody asked." Karen mediates: "Both of you are doing great." Mike hides a grin behind his beer can.

### Scene 164: Second Helpings
**Time:** 6:30 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen table
**Description:** Tyler reaches across the table for the casserole dish, spooning another helping onto his plate. Teenage appetite — bottomless. He also takes another roll. Karen smiles, pleased the food is appreciated. Mike goes for seconds too. The casserole dish is getting emptied. Lily pushes her nearly-full plate of green beans to the side, hoping no one notices. Tyler catches her eye and smirks knowingly. He's done the same thing with vegetables his entire life.

### Scene 165: Carrying and Scraping Plates
**Time:** 6:38 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, table to sink
**Description:** Dinner winds down. Karen announces it's Tyler's turn to clear. He stands and stacks the plates, carrying them from the table to the sink. He opens the cabinet under the sink to reveal the trash can and scrapes food scraps off each plate — leftover green beans, a crust of roll, bits of casserole — the scraps falling into the bin. Lily brings the glasses. Mike remains at the table, finishing his beer, reading something on his phone. Karen stores leftover casserole in a Tupperware container.

### Scene 166: Loading the Dishwasher
**Time:** 6:40 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, dishwasher area
**Description:** Tyler pulls open the dishwasher door and slides out the lower rack. He loads each rinsed plate into the slots, the ceramic clicking against the plastic prongs. The glasses go on the top rack, upside down. Forks and knives go into the silverware basket, handles down. He works methodically if not enthusiastically — dish duty is dish duty. The casserole dish goes into the sink to soak — too big for the dishwasher. The white racks slide back in when he's done loading.

### Scene 167: Starting the Dishwasher
**Time:** 6:42 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, dishwasher
**Description:** Tyler drops a detergent pod into the dishwasher dispenser, closes the door, and presses the start button. The machine hums to life, water beginning to slosh inside. He wipes down the table surface with a damp cloth — a half-effort wipe, getting the big crumbs. Karen hand-washes the casserole dish at the sink. The kitchen is mostly clean now, the warm dinner smell lingering. Tyler is free from kitchen duty. He dries his hands on a towel and heads for the living room.

---

## PART 13: EVENING RELAXATION (6:45 PM - 9:30 PM)

### Scene 168: Joining Family in Living Room
**Time:** 6:45 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, evening
**Description:** Tyler drops onto the brown sectional couch in the living room, sinking into the cushions. The living room is cozy: the large flat-screen TV mounted on the wall, a coffee table with a few remotes and a magazine, a floor lamp casting warm light, family photos on the bookshelf, a throw blanket draped over the couch arm. Mike is already settled in his leather recliner, sock feet up. Karen comes in with her laptop and sits at the other end of the couch. Lily has retreated to her room already.

### Scene 169: Arguing Over the Remote
**Time:** 6:48 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, couch
**Description:** Tyler grabs the TV remote from the coffee table and starts scrolling through streaming options. Mike wants the football game. Tyler wants to watch something else. "It's Thursday — no football tonight, Dad." Mike considers this. Karen votes for a comedy series they've been watching. Tyler agrees — anything is fine, he'll be on his phone anyway. He navigates Netflix, scrolling through thumbnails until he finds the show. He hits play. The screen fills with the opening credits.

### Scene 170: Watching TV Together
**Time:** 7:00 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, couch and recliner
**Description:** The family watches TV together — Tyler on the couch under the throw blanket, legs stretched out on the coffee table (Karen tells him to take them down; he does, then slowly puts them back), Mike in the recliner with his eyes half-closed, Karen half-watching while browsing something on her laptop. The comedy show plays, the laugh track punctuating the warm room. The living room window shows full darkness outside now — the streetlight across the road casting an orange glow.

### Scene 171: Laughing at the Show
**Time:** 7:15 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room
**Description:** Something funny happens on the show. Tyler laughs out loud, a genuine belly laugh that catches him off guard. Mike chuckles from the recliner, opening his eyes properly. Karen looks up from her laptop and smiles. A shared moment of family entertainment — brief but warm. Tyler catches his breath, still grinning. "That was actually good," he admits. The show continues and he settles back into the couch.

### Scene 172: Texting Friends on the Couch
**Time:** 7:30 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, couch
**Description:** Tyler's attention splits between the TV and his phone. He texts in the group chat — friends discussing weekend plans, sharing memes, debating which game to play tonight. His phone screen glows in his hands, thumbs moving rapidly. He grins at a meme Jake sent, tilts the phone to show it to no one in particular, then goes back to texting. Mike makes a comment about "kids and their phones." Tyler doesn't look up. The TV plays on, becoming background noise.

### Scene 173: Getting an Evening Snack
**Time:** 7:45 PM — kitchen
**Setting:** Kitchen, at freezer
**Description:** Tyler gets up from the couch and pads to the kitchen in his socks. He opens the freezer — cold air billowing out — and pulls out a carton of chocolate chip ice cream. He grabs a bowl from the cabinet and a spoon from the drawer. Two generous scoops of ice cream drop into the bowl with satisfying thuds. He puts the carton back. "Mom, you want some?" he calls. "Yes, please!" He makes a second bowl, slightly smaller. He carries both bowls back to the living room, cold ceramic against his palms.

### Scene 174: Ice Cream on the Couch
**Time:** 7:50 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, couch
**Description:** Tyler hands Karen her bowl of ice cream and settles back on the couch with his own. The chocolate chip ice cream is cold and sweet, the chips crunchy against the creamy base. He eats spoonfuls while watching the show. Mike waves off the ice cream offer — "Trying to cut back." The spoon clinks against the ceramic bowl. Tyler's feet are tucked under the throw blanket. The ice cream is gone in five minutes; the bowl sits empty on the coffee table.

### Scene 175: Dad Heading to Bed
**Time:** 8:15 PM — living room
**Setting:** Living room, recliner area
**Description:** Mike yawns hugely and pushes the recliner footrest down. "I'm done. Early shift tomorrow." He stands, stretches his back with a grimace, and heads for the stairs. "Night, bud." Tyler waves without looking away from his phone. "Night, Dad." Mike's heavy footsteps go up the stairs. The factory schedule means early bedtimes. Karen continues on her laptop, the TV show still playing. The household starts its slow unwinding.

### Scene 176: Going Back to Room
**Time:** 8:30 PM — staircase
**Setting:** Staircase, ascending
**Description:** Tyler decides to head to his room. "Night, Mom." "Not too late on the games, okay?" "I know." He climbs the stairs, stepping over the creaky third step out of habit. The upstairs hallway is dim — Lily's door is closed, light off. His parents' bedroom door shows light under it but the house is quiet. He enters his bedroom and closes the door behind him. His domain. The posters on the walls greet him. The desk lamp is still on from homework time.

### Scene 177: Gaming Session — Setting Up
**Time:** 8:35 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, desk
**Description:** Tyler sits at his desk and puts on the gaming headset, the cushioned ear cups settling over his ears. He opens the laptop and launches Discord. Friends are online — Jake, Marcus, a couple others from school. He joins the voice channel. "What are we playing?" The familiar voices crackle through the headset, debating game choices. Tyler opens the game launcher, clicks on the FPS game they settle on. Loading screens appear. He cracks his knuckles — a bad habit — and grabs the mouse. Game time.

### Scene 178: Gaming — Intense Session
**Time:** 8:50 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at laptop, dark room
**Description:** Tyler is deep in a gaming session, the laptop screen the brightest light in the now-dark room. His face is lit by the game's flashing colors — blues, reds, explosions. His fingers fly across the keyboard, mouse jerking in quick precise movements. He talks rapidly into the headset mic: "On your left — no, your other left — nice shot!" His body tenses during intense moments, leaning forward, then relaxes when the round ends. The Doritos crumbs from earlier are still on the desk. The window behind him shows only darkness and his faint reflection.

### Scene 179: Gaming — Chatting Between Rounds
**Time:** 9:05 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, leaning back
**Description:** Between game rounds, Tyler leans back in the desk chair, headset still on, chatting with friends. The conversation drifts from game strategy to real life: school gossip, the math test (everyone thinks they bombed it), plans for the weekend, whether anyone is going to the homecoming dance. Tyler laughs at something Marcus says. "Dude, no way." The loading screen spins on the laptop. These between-round conversations are sometimes better than the games themselves — casual, comfortable connection.

### Scene 180: Watching YouTube/TikTok
**Time:** 9:15 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, on bed with phone
**Description:** Tyler takes a break from gaming, flopping onto his bed with his phone. He scrolls TikTok, the screen cycling through short videos — a funny clip, a basketball highlight, someone's cooking video, a meme format he's seen twelve variations of today. His headset sits around his neck, still connected to Discord where friends continue to chat. The desk lamp casts a cone of light on the empty desk. Tyler lies on his stomach, chin propped on a pillow, blue light from the phone reflecting in his blue eyes. The minutes melt away.

### Scene 181: Mom Says Wrap It Up
**Time:** 9:25 PM — bedroom, voice from hallway
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, on bed
**Description:** A knock on the bedroom door and Karen's voice: "Tyler, start getting ready for bed. School tomorrow." "Okay," Tyler calls back, not moving. He hears her footsteps continue down the hall to her room. He looks at his phone — 9:25 PM. He scrolls for one more minute, then two, then forces himself to sit up. He swings his legs off the bed, sets the phone on the nightstand. "Gotta go, guys," he says toward the headset. He pulls it off and hangs it on the desk chair. Time for the bedtime routine.

---

## PART 14: BEDTIME ROUTINE (9:30 PM - 10:30 PM)

### Scene 182: Going to the Bathroom
**Time:** 9:30 PM — hallway/bathroom
**Setting:** Upstairs hallway to bathroom
**Description:** Tyler walks down the hallway to the bathroom, passing Lily's closed door. The hallway is dim — only the bathroom light spills from under the door. He pushes it open (Lily was in there earlier, left the light on) and enters. The bathroom is as he left it this morning — the mirror is clear now, the counter slightly cluttered with toiletries. He closes the door behind him, the lock clicking.

### Scene 183: Using the Toilet
**Time:** 9:31 PM — bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom
**Description:** Tyler uses the toilet — a standard nighttime routine stop. The bathroom is quiet, the overhead light bright after the dim hallway and dark bedroom. The white porcelain toilet sits beside the vanity, the chrome handle gleaming under the overhead light. He finishes and presses the flush handle, the water rushing and swirling in the bowl. An everyday, mundane necessity — but part of the routine nonetheless.

### Scene 184: Washing Hands
**Time:** 9:32 PM — bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Tyler moves to the sink and turns on the warm water. He pumps soap from the dispenser on the counter — a clear liquid soap — and rubs his hands together under the stream, working up a lather between his fingers. The water rinses the suds away, swirling down the chrome drain. He shakes his hands once over the basin and dries them on the hand towel hanging on the chrome ring beside the mirror. Quick, efficient, done.

### Scene 185: Applying Night Face Wash
**Time:** 9:33 PM — bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Tyler grabs the blue Neutrogena acne face wash bottle from the counter — the dermatologist's twice-daily instruction. He squeezes a dime-sized amount into his palm and works it over his face: forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, small circles with his fingertips. His eyes are closed against the suds, mouth set in concentration. A slight lather forms along his hairline and jawline. The face wash tingles faintly — the active ingredients doing their work on his teenage skin.

### Scene 186: Rinsing Face
**Time:** 9:34 PM — bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Tyler cups warm water from the running faucet and splashes it over his face, rinsing the face wash away. He splashes several times, water dripping from his chin and jawline into the basin. Soapy water swirls down the drain. He straightens up and pats his face dry with the hand towel, pressing the fabric against his cheeks and forehead. His skin looks slightly red from the day but clean. The mirror shows his reflection — tired eyes, damp skin, hair messy from the water.

### Scene 187: Brushing Teeth at Night
**Time:** 9:35 PM — bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at mirror
**Description:** Tyler squeezes toothpaste onto the blue toothbrush and brushes his teeth in front of the mirror. The brushing is quicker than this morning — efficient, the muscle memory of routine. He's tired. His eyes droop as he brushes, the blue toothbrush moving back and forth mechanically. White foam builds around his mouth. His free hand rests on the counter. The overhead light catches the tired lines of his face.

### Scene 188: Rinsing Brush and Turning Off Light
**Time:** 9:37 PM — bathroom
**Setting:** Family bathroom, at sink
**Description:** Tyler spits toothpaste foam into the sink, rinses his mouth with cupped water, and spits again. He rinses the blue toothbrush under the faucet, taps it twice on the sink edge, and places it back in the ceramic holder. The toothpaste tube gets the cap pushed back on. He stares at his reflection for a moment — the face of a sixteen-year-old who has been awake for fifteen hours. He flicks off the bathroom light, the room going dark, and heads back to the hallway.

### Scene 189: Removing Day Clothes
**Time:** 9:38 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, dim
**Description:** Tyler enters his bedroom, closing the door. The room is lit only by the desk lamp and the faint glow of the laptop in sleep mode. He pulls off his sweatpants, stepping out of them and leaving them where they fall on the tan carpet. He pulls off his socks, balling them loosely and dropping them on the floor near the sweatpants. He keeps the graphic t-shirt on — it's comfortable enough to sleep in. The room is quiet, the house settling around him.

### Scene 190: Putting on Basketball Shorts
**Time:** 9:39 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, at dresser
**Description:** Tyler opens a dresser drawer and grabs a pair of black basketball shorts — his sleep outfit, same as every night. He steps into them and pulls them up, the nylon fabric swishing. The elastic waistband settles on his hips. He stands in the dim room in a graphic tee and basketball shorts, the mirror on the closet door reflecting his silhouette. Ready for bed. The desk lamp casts a warm glow across the messy room.

### Scene 191: Plugging in Phone
**Time:** 9:40 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, nightstand
**Description:** Tyler plugs his phone into the charging cable on the nightstand. The phone screen lights up briefly, showing the charging indicator and the time — 9:40 PM. He sets an alarm for 6:30 AM — the same alarm that will torment him tomorrow morning. The notification badges show unread messages he's ignoring until morning. The white charging cable connects phone to the wall outlet behind the nightstand. He places the phone screen-down. Or tries to. He picks it back up.

### Scene 192: Scrolling in Bed
**Time:** 9:45 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, in bed with phone
**Description:** Tyler lies in his twin bed under the navy comforter, propped against the pillow, phone held above his face. He scrolls through Instagram stories — classmates posting homework complaints, selfies, memes. Then TikTok — the endless feed. The blue light of the screen illuminates his face in the dark room. His eyelids are heavy but his thumb keeps swiping. The desk lamp is off now. The room is dark except for the phone's glow and the faint red numbers of the digital clock. This is the modern bedtime ritual — screen time in the dark.

### Scene 193: One More Video
**Time:** 10:00 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Tyler watches one more TikTok video, then another, then another. He tells himself "last one" three times. A video makes him laugh quietly — he doesn't want to alert Mom. His eyes are getting heavier, the phone occasionally dipping toward his face as his arms tire. The group chat has gone quiet — friends are going to bed too. He likes a few posts, checks Snapchat one final time, and finally sets the phone on the nightstand with a conscious effort of willpower. The screen goes dark.

### Scene 181: Adjusting Pillow and Blanket
**Time:** 10:05 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, in bed
**Description:** Tyler adjusts his pillow — flipping it to the cool side, a nightly ritual. He pulls the navy comforter up to his chin and shifts onto his side, finding the comfortable position. The bed creaks slightly under his movement. The room is dark and quiet. Through the window, the streetlight casts a faint orange glow on the ceiling. The posters on the walls are dark shapes. The house is silent — Dad's been asleep for hours, Mom's light is off, Lily's room is dark. Just the faint hum of the house's heating system.

### Scene 182: Staring at the Ceiling
**Time:** 10:10 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, lying in bed
**Description:** Tyler lies on his back, eyes open, staring at the dark ceiling. His mind replays the day: the math test — did he get that one problem right? Soccer with Jake — that goal was nice. The dinner casserole — Mom's a good cook. The gaming session — they actually won most rounds tonight. Random thoughts bounce around, the way they do when the body is tired but the brain hasn't caught up yet. He blinks slowly. His breathing deepens.

### Scene 183: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 10:25 PM — bedroom
**Setting:** Tyler's bedroom, wide view
**Description:** Tyler is asleep in his twin bed, navy comforter pulled up, face peaceful and slack against the pillow. His sandy brown hair fans messily across the white pillowcase. One hand rests on his chest, the other tucked under the pillow. The room is dark and still. The phone charges silently on the nightstand, alarm set for 6:30 AM, ready to start the cycle again. Through the window, the quiet small-town Ohio night: the streetlight, the silhouettes of houses, a few stars visible between clouds. A day in the life — complete. Tomorrow, the alarm will blare again.
