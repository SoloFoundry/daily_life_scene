# A Day in the Life of Valentina: Visual Scene Descriptions

---

## DOCUMENT CONTEXT

### Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document contains detailed scene descriptions for generating high-quality anime illustrations depicting a full weekday in the life of Valentina Restrepo, a 34-year-old Colombian doctor living and working in Cali, Colombia.

**Project Goal:** Create visual learning content that helps learners (children, ESL students, people with special learning needs, etc.) identify everyday objects and associate vocabulary with realistic images showing objects in their natural context.

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Objects shown in real-world settings (stethoscope in consultation room, not isolated)
- Logical sequence helps learners understand daily routines
- Character interactions with objects show purpose and usage
- Repetition of locations (bedroom morning + night) reinforces learning
- Cultural context embedded naturally (Colombian daily life, medical profession)

### Scene Description Format

Each scene in this document follows a consistent format for easy parsing and image generation:

```
### Scene [NUMBER]: [TITLE]
**Time:** [TIME] — [LIGHTING CONDITION]
**Setting:** [LOCATION], [CAMERA ANGLE/VIEW]

  - Character appearance and clothing
  - Character action/pose
  - All visible objects with details (color, material, brand if relevant)
  - Room/environment details

- **Object-rich** — Every visible object is mentioned
- **Sensory details** — Textures, materials, colors, lighting
- **Consistent character** — Same clothing within time periods
- **Logical flow** — Scenes connect naturally

## PART 1: EARLY MORNING — BEDROOM (5:30 AM - 5:45 AM)

### Scene 001: The Alarm
**Time:** 5:30 AM — deep darkness, faint amber glow from phone screen
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, viewed from foot of bed
**Description:** A 34-year-old Colombian woman with long dark brown wavy hair lies under a lightweight white cotton duvet, eyes closed, face relaxed in sleep. On the pale wooden nightstand beside her, a smartphone screen glows brightly, displaying "5:30 AM" with an alarm interface. A small white ceramic lamp with a linen shade is switched off. A glass of water sits half-full beside the phone. The window behind the bed has sheer white curtains, showing nothing but blackness outside — Cali is still asleep. A small oscillating fan hums on the dresser across the room. The walls are painted a soft warm white, and a framed watercolor of Cali's San Antonio neighborhood hangs above the headboard.

### Scene 002: Reaching for the Phone
**Time:** 5:30 AM — deep darkness, phone glow only
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, close-up on nightstand area
**Description:** A woman's hand emerges from under the white cotton duvet, fingers reaching toward the glowing smartphone on the pale wooden nightstand. Her nails are short and clean, unpainted — practical for a doctor. The phone screen shows the alarm with a "Dismiss" slider. The bedside lamp, water glass, and a small framed photo of a couple stand on the nightstand. The room is entirely dark except for the cool white glow of the phone screen casting shadows across the nightstand surface. Her face is partially visible on the pillow, eyes squinting against the light.

### Scene 003: Sitting Up in Bed
**Time:** 5:31 AM — faint pre-dawn darkness
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, side view
**Description:** Valentina sits on the edge of the bed, bare feet touching the cool ceramic tile floor typical of Colombian apartments. She wears a light gray cotton tank top and soft black shorts. She hunches slightly forward, rubbing her eyes with one hand. The white duvet is pushed aside, revealing light blue sheets. The pale wooden bed frame has a simple modern headboard. On the floor beside the bed are woven leather sandals. The nightstand phone now shows the home screen. The oscillating fan on the dark wood dresser turns slowly, its blades catching the faint glow from the phone. A full-length mirror leans against the far wall.

### Scene 004: Stretching by the Window
**Time:** 5:32 AM — faint grayish pre-dawn through curtains
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, full room view
**Description:** Valentina stands beside the window, arms raised above her head in a full-body stretch, wearing her gray tank top and black shorts. Her long dark wavy hair falls down her back, slightly tangled from sleep. Her eyes are closed, face tilted slightly upward. The sheer white curtains show the faintest hint of gray-blue pre-dawn sky. The bed is unmade behind her, white duvet bunched to one side. A small bookshelf against the wall holds paperback novels and a few medical textbooks. A woven basket with folded throw blankets sits in the corner. The ceramic tile floor is a warm terracotta color.

### Scene 005: Changing into Running Clothes
**Time:** 5:35 AM — pre-dawn darkness, bedroom light on
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, view toward open closet
**Description:** Valentina stands before her open sliding closet with mirrored doors, pulling on a pair of dark blue athletic leggings. She already wears a fitted black sports bra. Inside the closet, professional blouses and dress pants hang on wooden hangers alongside a row of casual tops. On the closet floor, running shoes, leather flats, and low heels are neatly arranged. A small shelf holds folded workout clothes in dark colors. Her medical ID badge hangs on a hook inside the closet door. A white doctor's coat is visible hanging on the outside of the closet, pressed and ready. The overhead bedroom light is on, a simple modern fixture casting even white light.

### Scene 006: Lacing Running Shoes
**Time:** 5:37 AM — overhead bedroom light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, low angle close-up
**Description:** Valentina sits on the edge of her made bed, leaning forward to lace up white-and-teal running shoes. She wears dark blue athletic leggings and a light teal moisture-wicking tank top over the black sports bra. Her long dark hair is pulled back into a high ponytail secured with a black elastic band. Her fingers work the laces tight. On the floor beside her feet, a black running armband for her phone lies ready. A small zippered pouch with her apartment key sits on the nightstand. The terracotta tile floor is visible beneath her shoes.

### Scene 007: Grabbing Phone and Earbuds
**Time:** 5:38 AM — overhead bedroom light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand picking up her smartphone and wireless earbuds in a white charging case from the pale wooden nightstand. The phone screen shows a running app with a route pre-loaded through Parque del Perro and surrounding streets. The small zippered key pouch is already clipped to her waistband. The bedside water glass is now empty — she drank it. The framed photo of the couple is visible beside the lamp. Her teal tank top and ponytail are visible at the edge of the frame.

### Scene 008: Leaving the Apartment
**Time:** 5:40 AM — hallway fluorescent light, darkness outside
**Setting:** Valentina's apartment front door, interior hallway view
**Description:** Valentina opens her apartment front door, stepping into the building hallway. She wears dark blue leggings, a teal running tank, and white-and-teal running shoes. Her phone is strapped to her right arm in the black armband, and white wireless earbuds are in her ears. The apartment interior behind her shows a glimpse of the tiled entryway with a small console table holding a ceramic bowl for keys and a potted succulent. A pair of leather work flats sits by the door. The hallway outside has cream-colored walls and fluorescent ceiling lights. She pulls the door shut behind her with one hand.

## PART 2: MORNING RUN (5:40 AM - 6:15 AM)

### Scene 009: Apartment Building Exit
**Time:** 5:42 AM — pre-dawn darkness, security lamp glow
**Setting:** Apartment building entrance, exterior view
**Description:** Valentina pushes through the glass front door of her apartment building into the warm pre-dawn Cali air. A uniformed security guard sits behind a small desk in the lobby, visible through the glass, giving her a wave. The building exterior is modern stucco painted pale yellow with terracotta trim, typical of El Penon neighborhood. A security lamp above the entrance casts a warm orange cone of light onto the concrete sidewalk. Tall palm trees flank the entrance, their fronds dark silhouettes against the deep blue pre-dawn sky. She adjusts her earbuds as she steps onto the sidewalk.

### Scene 010: Warm-Up Stretches
**Time:** 5:43 AM — pre-dawn darkness, streetlight illumination
**Setting:** Sidewalk outside apartment building, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina stands on the concrete sidewalk under a yellow streetlight, performing a standing quad stretch — right foot pulled behind her, left hand steadying against a low concrete wall. She wears her dark blue leggings and teal tank top, ponytail swaying slightly. The street is quiet and empty, a few parked cars along the curb including her silver Toyota Corolla. Tropical plants — birds of paradise and bougainvillea — grow in the building's front garden. The air has a warm, humid quality even in the pre-dawn hour. A stray cat watches from behind a parked motorcycle.

### Scene 011: Running Through Neighborhood Streets
**Time:** 5:48 AM — earliest hints of dawn, streetlight glow
**Setting:** El Penon neighborhood street, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina runs with a steady stride down a quiet residential street in El Penon. Low-rise apartment buildings with balconies line both sides, some with potted plants trailing over railings. Mature trees arch over the road creating a green canopy barely visible in the pre-dawn light. Yellow streetlights cast pools of warm light on the asphalt. She runs on the sidewalk, arms pumping at her sides, ponytail bouncing. A bakery on the corner has its lights on, a worker visible inside preparing the day's bread. The warm tropical air shows no mist — Cali's climate is dry and warm.

### Scene 012: Entering the Park
**Time:** 5:52 AM — dawn breaking, sky turning orange-pink at horizon
**Setting:** Parque del Perro entrance, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina jogs through the entrance of Parque del Perro, a popular park in Cali with a distinctive bronze dog statue at its center. The sky is beginning to lighten — a band of warm orange-pink appears along the eastern horizon above the low buildings. The park has paved paths winding through tropical landscaping — tall palms, flowering bushes, and wide-canopy trees. A few other early morning runners and dog walkers are visible as silhouettes. Park benches made of green-painted metal line the paths. Valentina's face shows focused determination, her breathing steady and controlled.

### Scene 013: Running Along the Park Path
**Time:** 5:55 AM — early dawn, golden-pink sky
**Setting:** Park running path, tracking shot from side
**Description:** Valentina runs along a paved path that curves through the park, surrounded by lush tropical greenery. Tall royal palms rise overhead, their trunks smooth and gray-white. Flowering shrubs with red and yellow blossoms edge the path. The sky is now a dramatic gradient — deep blue above fading to warm gold and pink near the horizon. Other joggers pass in the opposite direction. A man walks two small dogs on leashes. Valentina's stride is long and athletic, her teal tank slightly darkened with sweat at the center of her back. Her running app shows 2.3 km on the armband screen.

### Scene 014: Pausing at Water Fountain
**Time:** 6:02 AM — dawn light, warm golden glow
**Setting:** Park, close-up at water fountain
**Description:** Valentina bends over a concrete drinking fountain in the park, pressing the chrome button to release a stream of water. She cups some water in her hand and splashes it on the back of her neck. Her face is flushed from the run, small beads of sweat on her forehead and temples. The ponytail sticks slightly to her damp neck. Behind her, the park is now bathed in warm early morning light, casting long shadows from the palm trees across the green grass. A worn wooden bench with peeling green paint sits nearby. She catches her breath, chest rising and falling.

### Scene 015: Cool-Down Walk
**Time:** 6:08 AM — warm morning sunlight
**Setting:** Park path, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina walks at a relaxed pace along the park path, hands on her hips, cooling down from her run. Her cheeks are flushed pink, and her teal tank top shows sweat marks. The morning sun is now fully above the horizon, casting long warm shadows through the palm trees and painting everything in rich golden light. A street vendor is setting up a cart near the park edge, arranging fresh fruit — sliced mango and pineapple in plastic cups. A mother pushes a stroller along an adjacent path. Valentina pulls one earbud out, listening to the morning sounds of Cali waking up — birdsong, distant traffic, a rooster crowing somewhere.

### Scene 016: Stretching in the Park
**Time:** 6:10 AM — warm morning sunlight
**Setting:** Park grassy area, full body view
**Description:** Valentina performs post-run stretches on a patch of green grass beside the path. She sits with legs extended in a V, reaching toward her right foot in a hamstring stretch. Her running shoes are teal and white against the bright green grass. Dew still clings to the blades of grass in the shade. Her phone and earbuds sit on the ground beside her. The park is becoming busier — a group of elderly men practice tai chi in the distance, and a young couple walks hand in hand. The sun warms her face, and she looks relaxed and satisfied from the workout.

### Scene 017: Walking Home
**Time:** 6:13 AM — bright morning light, building shadows
**Setting:** El Penon neighborhood street, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina walks briskly along the sidewalk back toward her apartment building, earbuds back in, phone on her arm. The neighborhood is waking up — a man in a white apron sweeps the entrance to a small tienda, a woman on a balcony waters potted red geraniums, and a yellow taxi passes on the street. Morning sunlight slants between the buildings, creating alternating patches of warm light and cool shadow on the sidewalk. Valentina's face is still slightly flushed from the run. She passes a small panaderia with its door open, the warm scent of fresh bread implied by the golden light spilling from inside.

### Scene 018: Re-entering Apartment Building
**Time:** 6:15 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Apartment building lobby, interior view
**Description:** Valentina walks through the glass front door of her apartment building into the lobby. The security guard, a middle-aged man in a navy uniform, looks up from a small portable radio and nods a greeting. The lobby has cream-colored tile floors, a small reception desk, and a wall of metal mailboxes. A potted palm plant stands in the corner. An elevator with stainless steel doors is visible at the end of the short hallway. Valentina presses the elevator call button, still breathing slightly elevated from the walk home. Her reflection in the elevator doors shows her sweaty running attire and disheveled ponytail.

## PART 3: POST-RUN — BATHROOM (6:18 AM - 6:50 AM)

### Scene 019: Entering the Apartment After Run
**Time:** 6:18 AM — bright morning light spilling through apartment windows
**Setting:** Valentina's apartment entryway, interior view
**Description:** Valentina steps inside her apartment, pulling the door closed behind her. She kicks off her white-and-teal running shoes on the terracotta tile by the door, placing them neatly beside her leather work flats. On the small wooden console table, the ceramic bowl holds her car keys and a tube of lip balm. The potted succulent on the console catches the morning light from a window in the adjacent living room. She unstraps the black phone armband from her right arm. A thin line of sweat traces her hairline. The apartment smells clean — a faint scent from a reed diffuser on the console table with pale wooden sticks in a glass bottle.

### Scene 020: Drinking Water in the Kitchen
**Time:** 6:19 AM — bright morning light through kitchen window
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, medium shot at counter
**Description:** Valentina stands at the granite kitchen counter, drinking a tall glass of water. She gulps it down quickly, her throat moving visibly. The kitchen has white cabinets with brushed silver handles, dark granite countertops, and a window above the sink letting in bright morning sunlight. A modern stainless-steel refrigerator stands to her left with a few photos and a small Colombian flag magnet. On the counter, a French press coffee maker in glass and chrome sits beside a ceramic canister of coffee beans labeled in Spanish. She refills the glass from a filtered water pitcher, still in her sweaty running clothes.

### Scene 021: Entering the Bathroom
**Time:** 6:20 AM — bright bathroom vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom doorway, interior view
**Description:** Valentina walks through the bathroom doorway, her hand reaching for the light switch on the cream-colored wall. The bathroom is spacious for an apartment — white porcelain tile floor, cream walls, a wide vanity with a white marble countertop and single undermount sink with a chrome faucet. A large rectangular mirror spans the wall above the vanity, flanked by two frosted-glass sconce lights. A glass-enclosed walk-in shower with a rainfall showerhead is visible in the background. Fluffy white towels hang on a chrome towel bar. A small shelf holds neatly arranged bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. A small potted orchid with pink blooms sits on the vanity corner.

### Scene 022: Removing Running Clothes
**Time:** 6:21 AM — bright bathroom vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, side view
**Description:** Valentina pulls her teal tank top over her head, standing beside a white wicker hamper with the lid open. Her ponytail gets momentarily caught in the fabric before pulling free. She drops the sweaty tank into the hamper. Her dark blue leggings and black sports bra are still on. The glass shower door is open, waiting. A non-slip white bath mat sits on the tile floor in front of the shower. A chrome hook on the wall holds a clean white towel within easy reach. The overhead exhaust fan hums softly.

### Scene 023: Turning on the Shower
**Time:** 6:22 AM — bright bathroom light, steam beginning
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, close-up on shower controls
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand turning the chrome shower handle inside the glass-enclosed shower. Water bursts from the large circular rainfall showerhead mounted in the ceiling, cascading straight down. Steam immediately begins to form in the warm Cali air. The shower walls are covered in rectangular white subway tiles. A built-in niche in the wall holds three bottles — amber-colored shampoo, white conditioner, and a green body wash, all in matching minimalist containers. A loofah sponge hangs from a suction cup hook. The glass door is beaded with water droplets.

### Scene 024: Showering
**Time:** 6:24 AM — bright bathroom light filtered through steam
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, view through steamy glass
**Description:** Valentina stands under the rainfall showerhead, water cascading over her head and shoulders. Her silhouette is visible through the steam-fogged glass door — she reaches up to run her fingers through her long dark hair, working shampoo into a lather. White foam runs down the glass interior. The steam has thickened, softening all edges in the room. The amber shampoo bottle has been moved from the niche. Water streams down the glass door in rivulets. The white tile walls glisten with moisture. The orchid on the vanity is partially obscured by the steam.

### Scene 025: Rinsing Hair
**Time:** 6:28 AM — bright bathroom light, heavy steam
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, view through glass door
**Description:** Valentina tilts her head back under the rainfall stream, rinsing shampoo from her long dark hair. Her eyes are closed, face upturned, water running in streams over her face and shoulders. Her hands smooth her hair back, the foam washing away. Through the glass, the outline of her figure is visible with water running down. The conditioner bottle is now in the niche where the shampoo was. Steam fills the upper portion of the bathroom, the mirror above the vanity completely fogged. The exhaust fan works against the warm tropical air.

### Scene 026: Turning Off the Shower
**Time:** 6:32 AM — bright bathroom light, residual steam
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, close-up on shower
**Description:** Valentina's hand turns the chrome shower handle to the off position. The last drops of water fall from the rainfall showerhead, catching the light like small crystals. The white tile walls are wet and gleaming. Water pools on the shower floor, draining through a circular chrome drain. The three bottles are arranged back in the niche. Through the partially open glass door, steam billows outward into the bathroom. Water droplets cling to the glass in irregular patterns. Valentina's arm is visible reaching for the towel on the chrome hook outside the shower.

### Scene 027: Wrapping in Towel
**Time:** 6:33 AM — bright bathroom light, dissipating steam
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, full figure at shower exit
**Description:** Valentina steps out of the shower onto the white non-slip bath mat, wrapping a large fluffy white towel around herself. Her long dark hair hangs wet and straight, dripping water onto her shoulders and the tile floor. Small puddles form on the terracotta-edged white tile. She tucks the towel corner securely. The glass shower door behind her is open, the interior still dripping. Steam dissipates slowly. Another smaller towel hangs on the rack, dry and waiting. She leaves wet footprints on the bath mat. Her face looks refreshed and alert.

### Scene 028: Wiping the Mirror
**Time:** 6:34 AM — bright vanity light, mirror clearing
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, facing vanity mirror
**Description:** Valentina stands at the vanity, wrapped in her white towel, using one hand to wipe a clear arc across the fogged mirror. Her reflection emerges through the condensation — wet dark hair framing her face, fresh complexion, brown eyes meeting her own gaze. Water droplets streak downward from where she wiped. The vanity counter holds a neatly organized set of items: a clear plastic container of cotton rounds, a bottle of micellar water, a tube of moisturizer with SPF, and the small potted orchid. The chrome faucet gleams under the sconce lights.

### Scene 029: Blow-Drying Hair
**Time:** 6:36 AM — bright vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, facing mirror from behind
**Description:** Valentina holds a matte black blow dryer in her right hand, directing warm air at her long dark hair while using a round brush in her left hand to smooth sections. She stands in front of the now-clear mirror, still wrapped in the white towel. Her hair is half dry — the sections near her face are smooth and flowing, while the back is still damp and darker. The blow dryer cord trails across the counter. A set of hair clips — small black claw clips — holds sections apart. The outlet is visible on the wall beside the mirror. The pink orchid blooms are reflected in the mirror behind her.

### Scene 030: Applying Moisturizer
**Time:** 6:42 AM — bright vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, close-up on face and hands
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina applying moisturizer with SPF to her face, using both hands to smooth the white cream across her cheeks and forehead in gentle upward strokes. Her skin is clean and slightly flushed from the warm shower. Her long dark hair, now dry and wavy, falls over her shoulders. Her eyebrows are naturally full and well-shaped. She looks in the mirror with concentration. The tube of moisturizer sits on the counter, its cap off. Cotton rounds and the micellar water bottle are nearby. The sconce lights create even, flattering illumination on her face.

### Scene 031: Light Makeup Application
**Time:** 6:44 AM — bright vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, facing mirror close-up
**Description:** Valentina applies a light coat of mascara, leaning slightly toward the mirror with her mouth open in the instinctive expression people make while applying mascara. She holds a black mascara wand in her right hand, coating her upper lashes. A small leather makeup bag lies open on the counter, revealing a concealer stick, a compact of pressed powder, a neutral lip tint, and a small blush compact. Her makeup approach is minimal and professional — natural-looking enhancement. Her dark hair is tucked behind one ear. The mirror reflects her focused expression.

### Scene 032: Putting Hair in a Bun
**Time:** 6:47 AM — bright vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Valentina twists her long dark wavy hair up into a neat professional bun at the back of her head, both arms raised. She holds a black hair elastic between her teeth while her fingers work the twist. Bobby pins are visible in her left hand — three black pins ready to secure loose strands. Her reflection shows the practiced motion of someone who does this every workday. The makeup bag is now closed and pushed aside. The orchid sits peacefully in the corner. A stray strand of hair falls across her forehead, which she will tuck in next.

### Scene 033: Securing the Bun with Bobby Pins
**Time:** 6:48 AM — bright vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, close-up on hands and hair
**Description:** Close-up from behind of Valentina's hands pressing black bobby pins into her dark hair bun, securing it firmly. Three pins are already placed, and she slides the final one in at an angle. The bun is tight, neat, and professional — no loose strands escape. The back of her neck is visible, clean and smooth. The mirror ahead shows the reflection of her concentrated expression. Her shoulders are bare above the white towel. The hair elastic is hidden beneath the twist. A small collection of bobby pins rests in a tiny white ceramic dish on the vanity.

**Time:** 6:50 AM — bright bedroom light, morning sun through window
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, view toward open closet
**Description:** Valentina, wrapped in her white towel with hair in a neat bun, stands before her open mirrored closet, reaching toward a light gray silk blouse on a wooden hanger. Her closet is organized by category — blouses and dress shirts on the left, pants and skirts in the center, casual clothes on the right. A shelf above holds folded sweaters and scarves. On the closet floor, three pairs of shoes are lined up: leather flats in tan, low black heels, and the white-and-teal running shoes from this morning. The white doctor's coat hangs on a hook on the closet door, a stethoscope draped over the hanger. Morning sunlight streams through the sheer curtains, painting warm stripes across the terracotta tile floor.

### Scene 035: Putting on Work Clothes
**Time:** 6:52 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, full-length mirror view
**Description:** Valentina buttons a light gray silk blouse, standing before the full-length mirror leaned against the wall. She wears fitted dark navy dress pants and a thin black leather belt. Her feet are bare on the cool terracotta tile. The bed behind her is still unmade, white duvet pushed aside. Her medical ID badge — a laminated card with her photo and "Dra. Valentina Restrepo" printed in blue — lies on the dresser ready to clip on. Small silver stud earrings glint in the mirror reflection. Her makeup is subtle and professional. The bun is perfectly in place.

### Scene 036: Putting on Shoes
**Time:** 6:54 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, low angle
**Description:** Valentina sits on the edge of her bed, slipping her right foot into a tan leather flat shoe. The left shoe is already on. Her dark navy pants are cropped slightly above the ankle, showing the transition to the leather flat. The closet is now closed, her mirrored doors reflecting the bright bedroom. The nightstand shows the phone screen dark, the water glass empty. A silver watch lies on the dresser beside the medical ID badge. The warm morning sun illuminates the scene, casting her shadow on the terracotta tile.

### Scene 037: Clipping on ID Badge
**Time:** 6:55 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, close-up on hands and chest
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands clipping her medical ID badge to the left breast pocket area of her gray silk blouse. The laminated badge shows her small photo, "Dra. Valentina Restrepo — Medicina General" in dark blue text, and the public hospital's logo. A silver alligator clip attaches it. Her silver watch is now on her left wrist, its face showing 6:55. Her nails are short and clean. The gray silk of the blouse has a soft sheen in the morning light. The dark navy pants are visible below.

### Scene 038: Making Coffee
**Time:** 6:57 AM — bright warm morning light through kitchen window
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, view of counter and coffee setup
**Description:** Valentina stands at the kitchen counter, scooping dark Colombian coffee grounds from a ceramic canister into a French press. The canister has a hand-written label in Spanish. A stainless steel kettle sits on the gas stove behind her, steam rising from its spout — the water just boiled. The kitchen window above the sink frames tropical greenery outside — a neighbor's mango tree is visible. White cabinets with brushed silver hardware line the upper walls. On the granite counter beside the French press: a small ceramic sugar bowl, a teaspoon, and a white porcelain mug. Morning sunlight pours through the window, illuminating the steam from the kettle.

### Scene 039: Pouring Hot Water into French Press
**Time:** 6:58 AM — bright morning light, steam rising
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, close-up on French press
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand tilting the stainless steel kettle, pouring steaming hot water into the glass French press filled with dark coffee grounds. The water hits the grounds and immediately darkens, swirling. Steam rises in a thick curl from the press. The chrome plunger assembly sits on the counter beside the press, waiting to be placed on top. Dark coffee grounds float at the surface of the water. Her hand is steady, the pour controlled. The ceramic canister and sugar bowl sit in the background. The granite countertop has small flecks of mica that catch the morning light.

### Scene 040: Slicing Tropical Fruit
**Time:** 7:00 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, view of cutting board
**Description:** Valentina stands at the counter, slicing a ripe papaya on a bamboo cutting board with a sharp chef's knife. The papaya is cut in half, revealing its bright coral-orange interior with small black seeds. Beside the cutting board, a ripe mango already sliced into a crosshatch pattern and turned inside-out sits on a white plate. A small bunch of bananas hangs from a wooden banana hook near the window. The French press sits to the right, dark coffee steeping with the chrome plunger now on top. The bright morning light catches the glistening surface of the fruit. Seeds and juice spread across the cutting board.

### Scene 041: Pressing the French Press
**Time:** 7:03 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, close-up on hands and French press
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands pressing down the chrome plunger of the French press slowly and firmly. The dark coffee compresses below the metal filter as she pushes. The glass walls of the press show the rich dark brown liquid above the compressed grounds. Her silver watch is visible on her wrist. Her gray silk blouse sleeve is pushed slightly up. The white porcelain mug waits beside the press. Steam still drifts from the surface of the coffee. The small ceramic sugar bowl with a tiny spoon in it sits ready. The morning sunlight backlights the scene through the window.

### Scene 042: Pouring Coffee
**Time:** 7:04 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina pours rich dark coffee from the French press into the white porcelain mug, the dark liquid flowing in a steady stream. A wisp of steam rises from the mug. She stands at the counter in her gray blouse and navy pants, hair in a neat bun, looking polished and professional. The plate of sliced tropical fruit — papaya wedges and mango pieces in bright orange and gold — sits on the counter beside a smaller white plate. The banana hook is visible in the background. She adds a small spoonful of sugar from the ceramic bowl, stirring with the teaspoon. The kitchen is bright and cheerful with morning light.

### Scene 043: Sitting Down to Breakfast
**Time:** 7:05 AM — warm morning light flooding through window
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen/dining area, seated at small table
**Description:** Valentina sits at a small round wooden dining table beside the kitchen window, her breakfast arranged before her. The white plate holds sliced papaya with its coral flesh, golden mango pieces, and a sliced banana. The white porcelain mug of dark coffee steams beside the plate. Her tablet is propped against a small wooden stand, displaying a medical news website with an article about tropical disease research. She holds a piece of mango with a small fork, about to eat. The morning sun illuminates the table, casting the shadow of the window frame across the wooden surface. A small vase with a single yellow flower sits at the table's center.

### Scene 044: Reading While Eating
**Time:** 7:08 AM — warm morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's dining table, over-shoulder view of tablet
**Description:** Over-shoulder view showing Valentina reading her tablet while eating breakfast. The tablet screen displays a medical journal article with charts and diagrams. Her right hand holds a small fork spearing a piece of papaya, while her left hand rests near the coffee mug. The plate is half-eaten — some fruit remains. A few drops of mango juice are visible on the white plate. The coffee level in the mug has dropped. Through the window beyond the table, the neighbor's mango tree sways slightly. The yellow flower in the vase catches sunlight. Her gray silk blouse is unwrinkled, her posture straight and professional even at breakfast.

### Scene 045: Finishing Coffee
**Time:** 7:12 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's dining table, close-up
**Description:** Valentina lifts the white porcelain mug to her lips, taking the last sip of dark coffee. The mug tilts, revealing the dark residue inside. Her plate is now empty save for a few fruit seeds and juice stains. The tablet has gone to sleep, its screen dark. She looks out the window while drinking, her expression thoughtful and calm — mentally preparing for the hospital shift ahead. The sugar bowl and teaspoon sit to the side. Morning light catches the silver watch on her wrist. A small napkin, folded and unused, sits beside the plate.

### Scene 046: Clearing Breakfast Dishes
**Time:** 7:13 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, at the sink
**Description:** Valentina stands at the kitchen sink, rinsing her breakfast plate and mug under running water from the chrome faucet. The water streams over the white porcelain plate, washing away fruit residue. She places the cleaned items on a small chrome drying rack beside the sink. Through the window above the sink, the mango tree and a glimpse of the neighbor's terracotta-roofed building are visible. The French press sits on the counter, still half-full of dark coffee — she will drink more when she returns home. A blue-and-white striped dish towel hangs from the oven handle. The kitchen is tidy, everything in its place.

### Scene 047: Packing Work Bag
**Time:** 7:15 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, view of couch and coffee table
**Description:** Valentina stands beside a gray linen sofa in the living room, packing her black leather work tote bag. She places items inside methodically: a small notebook with a blue cover, two black ballpoint pens, her wallet — brown leather with a brass clasp — and a reusable water bottle in stainless steel. Her stethoscope, a dark gray Littmann model, lies coiled on the coffee table ready to go in last. The living room has light hardwood-look laminate flooring, a glass-topped coffee table, and a bookshelf with medical texts, novels, and a few framed family photographs. A large window shows the bright Cali morning. A colorful woven throw pillow adds a pop of Colombian textile art to the sofa.

**Time:** 7:16 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, close-up on coffee table and bag
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand lifting the dark gray Littmann stethoscope from the glass coffee table and placing it carefully into her black leather tote. The stethoscope's bell and diaphragm gleam under the overhead light. The chest piece is a polished silver color. The tubing is coiled neatly. Inside the bag, the blue notebook, pens, and wallet are visible. The bag has an interior zippered pocket and an exterior side pocket holding her phone. The glass table surface reflects the morning light from the window. A small stack of medical journals sits on the other end of the coffee table.

### Scene 049: Putting on White Coat
**Time:** 7:18 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, standing by closet
**Description:** Valentina slips her arms into her crisp white doctor's coat, which she lifts from the hook on the closet door. The coat falls to mid-thigh length. On the left breast pocket, dark blue embroidery reads "Dra. Valentina Restrepo" with the hospital crest beneath. She adjusts the collar so it sits flat over her gray silk blouse. The coat has two large lower pockets and a small upper breast pocket where a black pen clip is visible. Her medical ID badge is clipped to the pocket. The closet mirror reflects her full professional appearance — bun, makeup, blouse, coat. She smooths the coat front with both hands. Her expression is focused and ready.

### Scene 050: Final Check in Mirror
**Time:** 7:19 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, facing full-length mirror
**Description:** Valentina stands before the full-length mirror leaned against the bedroom wall, doing a final appearance check. Her reflection shows the complete look: neat dark bun, subtle makeup, silver stud earrings, gray silk blouse under the white coat with ID badge, dark navy pants, tan leather flats. She adjusts the stethoscope around her neck — the diaphragm rests at her upper chest, tubing draped evenly on both sides. Her silver watch is visible below the coat cuff. The bedroom behind her is lit by morning sun through the sheer curtains. The bed is still unmade. She gives a small nod of satisfaction to her reflection.

### Scene 051: Gathering Keys and Bag
**Time:** 7:20 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Valentina's apartment entryway, view of console table
**Description:** Valentina picks up her car keys from the ceramic bowl on the console table by the front door. The keys have a silver Toyota fob and a small leather keychain. Her black leather tote hangs from her right shoulder, the stethoscope now tucked inside. Her phone is in her left hand, screen showing a map with estimated drive time to the hospital — 22 minutes. The reed diffuser and succulent sit on the console table. Her running shoes are by the door where she left them. A lightweight cotton scarf in pale blue hangs on a small coat hook by the door. She reaches for the apartment door handle with her key hand.

### Scene 052: Locking the Apartment Door
**Time:** 7:21 AM — building hallway fluorescent light
**Setting:** Apartment building hallway, exterior of Valentina's door
**Description:** Valentina turns the key in the lock of her apartment door — a heavy wooden door painted cream with a brass number plate reading "4B." She wears her full work outfit: white coat over gray blouse, navy pants, tan flats. The black tote bag hangs from her shoulder. The hallway has cream walls, a dark terracotta tile floor, and soft fluorescent overhead lights. A neighbor's door across the hall has a small woven welcome mat and a dried flower arrangement. Valentina drops the keys into the side pocket of her tote. The hallway leads to the elevator at the end.

**Time:** 7:23 AM — dim fluorescent garage light
**Setting:** Underground parking garage, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina walks through the underground parking garage of her apartment building, her tan leather flats clicking softly on the painted concrete floor. Rows of parked cars fill the low-ceilinged space — sedans, SUVs, a few motorcycles. Fluorescent tube lights cast a flat white glow with occasional flickers. She approaches her silver Toyota Corolla parked in a numbered spot near a concrete column painted with yellow stripes. Her white coat is bright against the dim garage. The tote bag is on her shoulder. A faded "SALIDA" exit sign with a green arrow glows at the far end.

### Scene 054: Unlocking the Car
**Time:** 7:24 AM — dim garage light, car headlights flash
**Setting:** Parking garage, close-up on car
**Description:** Valentina presses the key fob button, and the silver Toyota Corolla's headlights flash twice with a soft chirp — the doors unlock. The car is a four-door sedan, clean but not brand new, with a small hospital parking sticker on the lower windshield. She reaches for the driver's door handle. A small dent is visible on the rear bumper. The parking space has concrete wheel stops. A neighboring car, a white Mazda, is parked closely beside. The concrete column casts a shadow across the Corolla's hood. Her reflection is faintly visible in the car window — white coat, dark bun.

### Scene 055: Getting into the Car
**Time:** 7:24 AM — dim garage light transitioning to car interior light
**Setting:** Car interior, from passenger seat angle
**Description:** Valentina slides into the driver's seat of the Toyota Corolla, placing her black leather tote on the passenger seat. The car interior has gray cloth seats, a black dashboard, and a small air freshener shaped like a tree hanging from the rearview mirror. A phone mount is attached to the air vent. She reaches for the seatbelt with her right hand. The door is still open, the interior dome light casting warm yellow light across the dashboard. A pair of sunglasses sit in the center console cup holder. The steering wheel has a worn leather cover. A hospital parking pass hangs from the rearview mirror beside the air freshener.

### Scene 056: Starting the Engine
**Time:** 7:25 AM — car dashboard lights illuminating
**Setting:** Car interior, view of dashboard and hands
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand turning the ignition key, the Toyota's engine turning over and settling into a smooth idle. The dashboard instruments illuminate — speedometer, fuel gauge showing three-quarters full, and the temperature gauge. The digital clock reads 7:25. The radio comes on softly, tuned to a local Colombian news station — a voice discussing traffic and weather. She adjusts the rearview mirror slightly. Her medical ID badge reflects the dashboard glow. The seatbelt crosses diagonally over her white coat. She places her phone in the vent-mounted holder, the map app showing the route to Hospital Universitario del Valle.

### Scene 057: Pulling Out of Parking Garage
**Time:** 7:26 AM — transitioning from dim garage to bright morning sun
**Setting:** Parking garage exit ramp, driver's perspective
**Description:** The silver Toyota Corolla climbs the short ramp out of the underground parking garage. Bright morning sunlight floods through the windshield as the car emerges onto the street. Valentina's hand shields her eyes briefly against the sudden brightness. The apartment building exterior is visible in the rearview mirror — pale yellow stucco with palm trees. The street ahead shows El Penon's low-rise buildings and mature trees. A motorcycle passes in the opposite direction. The car's dashboard reflects in the windshield. Valentina reaches for the sunglasses in the console cup holder.

### Scene 058: Driving Through Cali Streets
**Time:** 7:30 AM — bright tropical morning light, some building shadows
**Setting:** Car interior with Cali street visible through windshield, over-shoulder view
**Description:** Valentina drives through Cali's morning traffic, both hands on the steering wheel, sunglasses on. Through the windshield, the city stretches ahead — a wide avenue lined with tall palm trees, low commercial buildings with colorful facades, and the distant green mountains of the Cordillera Occidental forming a backdrop. A MIO bus — Cali's public transit, white with green stripes — is in the adjacent lane. Motorcycles weave between cars. A street vendor stands at an intersection selling newspapers and candy. Traffic lights ahead show green. The radio plays softly. The phone mount shows the route with a blue line. Morning sunlight illuminates the scene.

### Scene 059: Stopped at a Red Light
**Time:** 7:35 AM — bright tropical light
**Setting:** Car interior, view through windshield at intersection
**Description:** The Toyota is stopped at a red traffic light at a busy intersection. Through the windshield, a mix of Colombian urban life is visible — a produce vendor with a cart of limes and avocados at the corner, motorcycles clustering at the front of the lane, pedestrians crossing in a diagonal crosswalk. A large billboard advertises a Colombian brand of coffee. The buildings at the intersection show a mix of modern glass storefronts and older colonial-era facades painted in bright yellows and greens. Valentina taps her thumbs on the steering wheel, waiting. The intersection sign reads "Cra 5 con Cll 15." The phone map shows 12 minutes remaining.

### Scene 060: Approaching the Hospital
**Time:** 7:48 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Street view with hospital visible ahead, through windshield
**Description:** Through the windshield, Hospital Universitario del Valle comes into view — a large multi-story concrete building with a prominent blue-and-white "HOSPITAL" sign on the facade. An ambulance is parked near the emergency entrance, its red-and-white paint gleaming. The hospital grounds have a few trees and a circular driveway for drop-offs. People — patients in wheelchairs, families walking, medical staff in white coats and scrubs — move near the entrance. Valentina signals right to turn into the staff parking lot. A security booth with a guard and a retractable barrier stands at the parking entrance. The radio plays a salsa song quietly.

### Scene 061: Entering Staff Parking Lot
**Time:** 7:50 AM — bright morning light
**Setting:** Hospital parking lot entrance, view through windshield
**Description:** Valentina lowers her window and holds her hospital ID badge toward a card reader at the parking lot entrance. The security guard in a light blue uniform nods from inside the small concrete booth. The retractable red-and-white striped barrier arm lifts. The staff parking lot is partially full — rows of cars in the morning light, some spaces marked "MEDICOS" in white paint. The hospital building looms ahead, its upper floors reflecting the morning sun. A few doctors and nurses walk from their cars toward the building. Valentina drives forward into the lot, scanning for a parking spot.

### Scene 062: Parking at the Hospital
**Time:** 7:52 AM — bright morning light, car shadow
**Setting:** Hospital parking lot, exterior view of car
**Description:** The silver Toyota Corolla pulls into a parking space marked with faded white lines. Valentina turns off the engine. Through the open driver's window, she is visible removing her sunglasses and placing them in the center console. The hospital building entrance is visible across the lot — glass double doors under a concrete canopy. Other cars surround her: a red Chevrolet Spark, a white Renault Duster, a blue motorcycle. She checks her phone briefly — a text message notification from "Mama" is visible on the screen. She gathers her tote bag from the passenger seat.

### Scene 063: Walking Toward Hospital Entrance
**Time:** 7:53 AM — bright morning light, slight heat shimmer
**Setting:** Hospital parking lot, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina walks across the asphalt parking lot toward the hospital entrance, her white coat bright in the morning sun. Her tote bag is on her right shoulder, phone in her left hand. Other medical staff walk alongside — a man in blue surgical scrubs with a lanyard ID, a woman in a white coat carrying a laptop bag. The hospital's concrete-and-glass facade stretches wide. Potted plants in large concrete planters line the walkway to the entrance. The air is warm — Cali's tropical climate is evident in the clear blue sky and the way heat shimmers slightly off the dark asphalt. Valentina walks with purpose, her tan flats clicking on the pavement.

### Scene 064: Entering Hospital Lobby
**Time:** 7:55 AM — transitioning from bright sun to cool fluorescent interior
**Setting:** Hospital lobby, interior wide shot
**Description:** Valentina pushes through the glass double doors into the hospital lobby. The large open space has white tile floors, high ceilings with fluorescent panels, and a long reception desk where two administrative staff in navy polos work at computers. A waiting area with rows of blue plastic chairs is half-full with patients and family members. Signs in Spanish point to different departments: "URGENCIAS," "CONSULTA EXTERNA," "LABORATORIO," "FARMACIA." A security checkpoint with a turnstile and card reader stands between the public area and the medical corridors. Valentina walks toward the turnstile, badge already in hand. The air conditioning provides relief from the outdoor heat.

### Scene 065: Badging Through Security
**Time:** 7:56 AM — cool fluorescent lobby light
**Setting:** Hospital security checkpoint, close-up
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina tapping her laminated ID badge against a black electronic card reader mounted on a chrome turnstile. The small screen flashes green and displays her name. The metal arm of the turnstile unlocks. Her badge photo shows a slightly younger version of herself, hair down instead of bunned. The hospital logo — a blue shield with a caduceus — is prominent on the badge. Behind her, the waiting room is visible with patients seated in blue chairs. Ahead, a wide corridor stretches into the medical wing with pale green walls and fluorescent ceiling lights. A nurse in lilac scrubs passes through the adjacent turnstile.

### Scene 066: Walking Through Hospital Corridor
**Time:** 7:57 AM — bright fluorescent corridor light
**Setting:** Hospital corridor, tracking shot from front
**Description:** Valentina walks briskly down a wide hospital corridor with pale green walls and white tile floors that squeak under her flats. Fluorescent lights hum overhead in long panels. Doors line both sides — some open, revealing glimpses of offices and supply rooms. Medical equipment is parked along one wall: a wheeled IV stand, a blood pressure monitor on a cart, a wheelchair folded against the wall. A whiteboard near the nurses' station displays today's on-call doctors and room assignments. Other staff pass — a young male nurse pushing a patient in a wheelchair, an older woman in a lab coat carrying a clipboard. Valentina greets a colleague with a quick wave and a "Buenos dias."

### Scene 067: Arriving at Consultation Room
**Time:** 7:59 AM — fluorescent office light

An exam table with a disposable paper sheet stands against the opposite wall, a step stool beside it. A wall-mounted blood pressure cuff and an otoscope/ophthalmoscope unit are attached to the wall near the exam table. A small window with frosted glass lets in diffused natural light. A rolling stool with a padded gray seat sits near the desk. A hand sanitizer dispenser is mounted by the door. Medical information posters in Spanish cover one wall — anatomy charts, vaccination schedules. She flips the light switch and sets her tote bag on the desk.

### Scene 068: Preparing for Patients
**Time:** 8:00 AM — mixed fluorescent and window light
**Setting:** Consultation room, desk area
**Description:** Valentina sits in the black rolling office chair, turning on the desktop computer. The screen glows to life, showing a login page for the hospital's medical records system. She pulls her stethoscope from the tote bag and drapes it around her neck. Her notebook and two pens are arranged beside the keyboard. The mouse pad shows the hospital logo. A small framed family photo sits on the desk corner — Valentina with an older couple (her parents) at a family gathering. She logs in, typing her credentials. A stack of patient files in Manila folders sits in a tiered paper organizer on the desk. A wall clock reads 8:00. She takes a deep breath and opens the morning schedule.

### Scene 069: Reviewing Morning Schedule
**Time:** 8:02 AM — fluorescent light, faint window glow
**Setting:** Consultation room, over-shoulder view of computer screen
**Description:** Over-shoulder view of Valentina studying the morning's patient schedule on the computer monitor. The screen shows a list of patient names, appointment times, and brief complaint descriptions in Spanish — "dolor de cabeza," "control diabetes," "tos cronica." Twelve patients are scheduled between 8:15 and 12:00. She scrolls down with the mouse, scanning the list. Her stethoscope hangs around her neck, the diaphragm resting on her white coat. A black pen is in her right hand, poised over the blue notebook. The Manila folders in the tiered organizer correspond to each patient. The wall clock reads 8:02.

### Scene 070: Calling First Patient
**Time:** 8:15 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room doorway, view toward waiting area
**Description:** Valentina stands at the consultation room door, holding a Manila folder open, looking toward the waiting area visible through the corridor. She calls out a patient name. Her posture is welcoming — slight lean forward, warm expression, the white coat hanging neatly. The door is propped open with her foot. Inside the room behind her, the computer screen glows, the desk is organized, and the exam table paper is fresh. A hand sanitizer dispenser is mounted on the wall by the door at arm height. Her ID badge catches the fluorescent light. Down the corridor, a patient — an elderly woman with gray hair in a floral blouse — begins to rise from a blue plastic chair.

### Scene 071: Greeting the Patient
**Time:** 8:16 AM — fluorescent consultation room light
**Setting:** Consultation room, medium shot of door area
**Description:** Valentina warmly greets the elderly patient at the consultation room door, extending her hand for a handshake. The patient, a woman in her seventies with silver hair pinned back, a colorful floral blouse, and a woven handbag, enters the room. A younger woman — the patient's daughter — follows behind carrying a plastic bag with medication bottles. Valentina gestures toward the two chairs beside her desk. The room feels small but clean. The hand sanitizer dispenser is within reach. Valentina's expression is warm and attentive, her body language open and welcoming.

### Scene 072: Listening to Patient History
**Time:** 8:18 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, seated at desk facing patient
**Description:** Valentina sits at her desk, leaning slightly forward, listening intently to the elderly patient who speaks animatedly. The patient sits in a molded plastic chair, gesturing with one hand toward her chest while describing symptoms. The daughter sits beside her, nodding. Valentina's blue notebook is open, her black pen writing quick notes in neat cursive. The computer screen behind her shows the patient's medical record. The stethoscope rests on Valentina's shoulders. Her expression is focused and empathetic — eyebrows slightly raised, eyes meeting the patient's. The Manila folder lies open on the desk showing previous visit notes.

### Scene 073: Using the Stethoscope
**Time:** 8:25 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, exam table area
**Description:** Valentina stands beside the exam table where the elderly patient now sits, the paper crinkling beneath her. Valentina holds the stethoscope's diaphragm against the patient's upper back, listening carefully. Her eyes are focused downward in concentration, lips slightly parted. The stethoscope earpieces are in her ears. Her left hand steadies the patient's shoulder gently. The patient leans slightly forward, breathing as instructed. The daughter watches from her chair near the desk. The wall-mounted blood pressure cuff hangs in the background. The otoscope unit is visible on its cradle. Valentina's white coat sleeves are pushed slightly up her forearms.

### Scene 074: Taking Blood Pressure
**Time:** 8:28 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, close-up on patient's arm
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina wrapping the black blood pressure cuff around the elderly patient's bare upper arm. The velcro fastener secures with a firm press. The patient's arm rests on the padded exam table. Valentina holds the rubber squeeze bulb in one hand and positions the stethoscope bell over the brachial artery with the other. The pressure gauge — a round dial with numbers — is clipped to the cuff. The patient's skin shows the texture of age, a simple gold bracelet pushed up above the cuff. Valentina's hands are steady and practiced. The dial reads zero before she begins pumping.

### Scene 075: Reading Blood Pressure Gauge
**Time:** 8:30 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, close-up on gauge and Valentina's face
**Description:** Close-up of the blood pressure gauge showing 138/85 as Valentina slowly releases the valve, the needle dropping. Her eyes are fixed on the gauge, stethoscope in ears, listening for the pulse sounds. She holds the gauge at eye level. The rubber tubing runs from the gauge to the cuff on the patient's arm in the background. Valentina's expression is concentrated — slight furrow in her brow as she notes the reading is slightly elevated. She makes a mental note. The consultation room wall behind shows the anatomy poster. A fluorescent light hums overhead.

### Scene 076: Writing a Prescription
**Time:** 8:35 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, desk area
**Description:** Valentina sits at her desk, writing on a prescription pad with her black pen. The pad has the hospital letterhead at the top in blue ink and pre-printed fields for patient name, date, and medication details. She writes carefully in legible script — medication name, dosage, frequency. The elderly patient and daughter sit across from her, watching. Valentina looks up periodically to explain the medication in simple terms, pointing to what she writes. Her stethoscope lies coiled on the desk beside the keyboard. The computer screen shows the patient's record with the new entry being typed simultaneously. The pen moves with confidence across the paper.

### Scene 077: Explaining Medication to Patient
**Time:** 8:38 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, medium shot across desk
**Description:** Valentina holds the prescription in one hand and a small informational pamphlet in the other, explaining the treatment plan to the elderly patient. She speaks slowly and clearly, pointing to specific text on the pamphlet — a printed guide about managing hypertension with illustrations of food and exercise. The daughter leans in, taking a photo of the prescription with her phone. The patient nods, looking somewhat concerned. Valentina's expression is reassuring and patient. She makes a "follow-up" note in her notebook. The wall clock shows 8:38. On the desk, a small plastic container holds wrapped tongue depressors and cotton balls.

### Scene 078: Saying Goodbye to Patient
**Time:** 8:40 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room door, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina stands at the consultation room door, shaking hands with the elderly patient as she leaves. The daughter holds the prescription and pamphlet in one hand, supporting her mother's elbow with the other. Valentina smiles warmly, her body angled toward the hallway. She hands a small appointment card — white with the hospital logo — indicating the follow-up date. The corridor is visible behind them, another patient waiting in a blue chair down the hall. The hand sanitizer dispenser is beside the door. Valentina's white coat and professional bearing convey authority and warmth simultaneously.

### Scene 079: Sanitizing Hands Between Patients
**Time:** 8:41 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, by door
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina pressing the hand sanitizer dispenser mounted on the wall, a dollop of clear gel landing in her cupped palm. She rubs her hands together vigorously — palms, between fingers, over wrists — in the practiced motion of a medical professional. The alcohol gel glistens on her skin. The dispenser is white plastic with the hospital logo. Behind her, the exam table paper is wrinkled from the previous patient. The empty consultation room is quiet for a moment between appointments. Her hands finish their methodical sanitizing — a ritual repeated dozens of times each shift.

### Scene 080: Replacing Exam Table Paper
**Time:** 8:42 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, exam table area
**Description:** Valentina walks to the exam table, tearing away the wrinkled paper sheet left by the previous patient. She crumples it and drops it into the small waste bin beside the table. From the roll mounted at the head of the exam table, she pulls a fresh length of white disposable paper, smoothing it flat across the padded vinyl surface with both hands. The paper tears cleanly at the perforated edge. The step stool is nudged back into position beside the table. The wall-mounted blood pressure cuff and otoscope unit hang ready. The room is reset — clean paper, sanitized hands, organized desk — prepared for the next patient. She glances at the clock and moves toward the doorway to call the next name.

### Scene 081: Examining a Child Patient
**Time:** 9:15 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, exam table area
**Description:** Valentina leans down to the eye level of a young boy, approximately 5 years old, who sits on the exam table looking nervous. The boy wears a red T-shirt and denim shorts, his legs dangling. His mother stands beside him, a hand on his shoulder reassuringly. Valentina holds a small rubber reflex hammer playfully, tapping her own knee first to show the boy it does not hurt. She smiles broadly, her expression gentle and playful. A sheet of colorful stickers — cartoon animals — peeks out of her coat pocket, ready as a reward. The otoscope is in her other hand, waiting to check the boy's ears. The mother wears a concerned but hopeful expression.

### Scene 082: Checking Child's Ears
**Time:** 9:18 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, close-up on examination
**Description:** Valentina gently holds the boy's head steady with one hand while looking into his ear with the otoscope — a silver handheld instrument with a pointed tip and magnifying lens. A small disposable speculum covers the tip. The boy's face is visible in profile, eyes wide, lips pressed together trying to be brave. Valentina's face is close, one eye pressed to the otoscope lens, her expression concentrated but soft. The mother watches closely from behind. The exam table paper crinkles under the boy. A box of disposable gloves sits on the nearby counter. The wall-mounted unit has the otoscope cradle empty.

### Scene 083: Giving Stickers to Child
**Time:** 9:25 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina holds out a sheet of colorful stickers to the young boy, who reaches eagerly with both hands, his nervousness completely gone. He picks a sticker of a cartoon jaguar — bright orange and black spots. His mother smiles, relieved the visit is over. Valentina writes notes in her blue notebook. A lollipop in a clear wrapper also appears from her coat pocket for the child. The prescription for the boy lies on the desk. The exam room looks bright and welcoming. The boy hops down from the exam table with a grin, sticker clutched proudly. Valentina gives the mother a reassuring nod.

### Scene 084: Mid-Morning Coffee Break
**Time:** 10:00 AM — fluorescent break room light
**Setting:** Hospital break room, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina sits at a small Formica table in the hospital break room, both hands wrapped around a small ceramic cup of tinto — the strong, sweet Colombian black coffee served in small portions. The break room has white walls, a counter with a coffee maker (a basic drip machine with a glass carafe half-full of dark coffee), a small microwave, and a mini-refrigerator with staff names written on masking tape labels. Two other medical staff members share the table — a male nurse in blue scrubs checking his phone, and an older female doctor in a white coat reading a newspaper. Valentina's eyes are slightly tired but content. She takes a slow sip. A wall calendar shows the month in Spanish.

### Scene 085: Checking Phone During Break
**Time:** 10:05 AM — fluorescent break room light
**Setting:** Hospital break room, close-up on phone
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands holding her phone above the break room table. The screen shows a WhatsApp conversation with "Andres" (heart emoji beside the name) — her long-distance partner. His message reads "Buenos dias mi amor, que tengas buen dia" with a sun emoji. She types a reply, thumbs moving on the keyboard. Her tinto cup is half-empty on the Formica table. Her nails are short and clean, her silver watch visible. The other staff members chat quietly in the background. A small bowl of hard candies sits in the center of the table. The clock on the break room wall shows 10:05.

### Scene 086: Walking to Hospital Ward
**Time:** 10:15 AM — bright fluorescent corridor light
**Setting:** Hospital corridor, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina walks down a different hospital corridor, carrying a clipboard with a stack of patient charts. This hallway is wider, with doors to patient rooms on both sides. Room numbers — 401, 402, 403 — are displayed on small blue plaques beside each door. Some doors are open, revealing hospital beds and medical equipment. A nurse pushes a medication cart with small labeled cups — the rattling of the cart echoes slightly. The floor is pale green linoleum, freshly mopped and shiny. Valentina's white coat billows slightly as she walks. Her stethoscope is around her neck. She checks the clipboard, reviewing the first patient's room number.

### Scene 087: Hospital Ward Rounds — Checking a Patient
**Time:** 10:20 AM — mixed fluorescent and window light
**Setting:** Hospital ward room, bedside
**Description:** Valentina stands beside a hospital bed where a middle-aged male patient lies, slightly elevated by the adjustable bed. He wears a blue hospital gown. An IV drip hangs from a chrome pole, the tubing connected to the back of his hand with medical tape. A heart monitor on a cart beside the bed shows a green line of steady heartbeats. Valentina reviews the chart on her clipboard, then looks at the patient with a warm, professional expression. She asks how he is feeling. The room has a window letting in morning light, a bedside table with a plastic water pitcher and cup, and a visitor's chair where a woman — the patient's wife — sits with a worried expression.

### Scene 088: Updating Patient Chart
**Time:** 10:30 AM — fluorescent ward light
**Setting:** Hospital ward, nurses' station
**Description:** Valentina stands at the nurses' station — a long counter with computers, file racks, and stacked supplies. She writes in a patient chart, updating vital signs and observations from her ward round. A nurse beside her enters data into a desktop computer. The station has a pegboard with room assignments and doctor names written in dry-erase marker. Bins of supplies line the counter — bandages, syringes in sealed packets, specimen cups. A phone rings. Valentina's pen moves across the paper form. The overhead fluorescent panels cast even light without shadows. Another doctor waits beside her to use the counter.

### Scene 089: Consulting with a Colleague
**Time:** 10:45 AM — fluorescent hallway light
**Setting:** Hospital corridor, two doctors talking
**Description:** Valentina and a male colleague — a tall man with glasses, graying temples, and a white coat with "Dr. Cardenas" embroidered on it — stand in the corridor looking at a tablet screen. The tablet shows an X-ray image of a chest. Valentina points to a specific area on the image, discussing something with her colleague. Both have serious, focused expressions. Their stethoscopes hang similarly around their necks. Other staff walk past in the busy corridor. A cart of clean linens is parked against the wall. The pale green walls and fluorescent lights create the institutional hospital atmosphere. Dr. Cardenas holds a coffee cup in his free hand.

### Scene 090: Second Round of Consultations
**Time:** 11:00 AM — fluorescent consultation room light
**Setting:** Consultation room, desk area
**Description:** Valentina is back in her consultation room, seated at the desk with a new patient — a young woman in her twenties wearing a university T-shirt and jeans. The patient holds a piece of paper — lab results from a previous visit. Valentina studies the results on the computer screen while simultaneously reviewing the printout. Her blue notebook has a new page of notes. The stethoscope lies on the desk. The young woman looks anxious, fidgeting with her phone in her lap. Valentina turns to her with a reassuring smile, beginning to explain the results. The anatomy poster is visible on the wall behind Valentina.

### Scene 091: Typing Medical Notes
**Time:** 11:30 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, close-up on hands and keyboard
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands typing rapidly on the keyboard, entering medical notes into the hospital's electronic record system. The screen shows a patient form with fields for diagnosis, treatment plan, and prescriptions. Her fingers move with practiced speed. The silver watch on her left wrist shows 11:30. Her white coat cuffs are slightly pushed up, revealing the gray silk blouse sleeves beneath. The Manila folder for the current patient lies open beside the keyboard. The mouse sits to the right. Reflected in the monitor glass, a faint image of her concentrated face is visible. The desk is more cluttered now than at the start of the shift — pens scattered, notebook pages filled.

### Scene 092: Last Morning Patient
**Time:** 11:45 AM — fluorescent light
**Setting:** Consultation room, exam area
**Description:** Valentina uses a tongue depressor — a flat wooden stick — to examine the throat of her last morning patient, an older man who sits on the exam table with his mouth wide open. She holds a small penlight in her other hand, directing a white beam into his throat. The patient says "ahhh," his face scrunched. Valentina leans close, examining. A box of disposable tongue depressors sits on the counter nearby. Used medical gloves lie in a small waste bin with a red biohazard symbol. The exam table paper is wrinkled from use. The wall clock reads 11:45. Valentina's ID badge swings slightly as she leans forward.

### Scene 093: Completing Morning Shift Notes
**Time:** 12:00 PM — fluorescent light, noon sun through frosted window
**Setting:** Consultation room, desk area
**Description:** Valentina sits at her desk completing the final notes for the morning shift. The computer screen shows the last patient's record being saved. She stretches her neck, rolling her head side to side — a sign of fatigue after four hours of consultations. Her blue notebook is filled with the morning's notes across several pages. The tiered paper organizer is now nearly empty — the Manila folders processed. She closes the blue notebook and places it in her tote bag. The frosted window lets in bright noon sunlight, casting a diffused glow across the desk. The family photo catches the light. She removes the stethoscope from her neck and places it in the bag.

### Scene 094: Heading to Hospital Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:10 PM — bright fluorescent corridor light
**Setting:** Hospital corridor, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina walks down the corridor toward the hospital cafeteria, her white coat still on but unbuttoned, her step lighter than the morning's purposeful stride. She passes a bulletin board with announcements — a health fair poster, a blood drive notice, staff meeting schedules, all in Spanish. The corridor opens into a wider area with signs pointing to "CAFETERIA" with an arrow. The smell of food is implied by the increasing foot traffic of staff heading in the same direction. She walks alongside the male nurse from the break room earlier, chatting casually. He carries a blue insulated lunch bag. Through a window, the noon sun blazes on the parking lot outside.

## PART 7: LUNCH (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM)

### Scene 095: Entering Hospital Cafeteria
**Time:** 12:15 PM — bright fluorescent cafeteria light, noon sun through large windows
**Setting:** Hospital cafeteria, wide shot from entrance
**Description:** Valentina enters the hospital cafeteria — a large open room with rows of Formica-topped tables and plastic stackable chairs. Large windows along one wall let in bright noon sunlight, warming the space. A serving line stretches along the back wall with stainless steel warming trays holding the day's offerings. A chalkboard menu lists the "almuerzo del dia" — soup, rice, meat, salad, juice. Staff in scrubs and white coats fill most tables, the noise level a steady hum of conversation and clinking utensils. Valentina picks up a tan plastic tray from a stack at the serving line entrance and joins the queue behind two nurses.

### Scene 096: Selecting Lunch
**Time:** 12:18 PM — bright cafeteria light
**Setting:** Hospital cafeteria serving line, close-up on food
**Description:** Valentina stands at the serving line, her tan tray held forward as a cafeteria worker — a woman in a white hairnet and blue apron — spoons food onto a sectioned plate. The plate receives a mound of white rice, a portion of pollo sudado (stewed chicken in tomato sauce), a scoop of red beans, and a small side salad of sliced tomato and avocado. A separate bowl receives sopa de ajiaco — a rich yellow-golden soup with chunks of potato, corn on the cob, and herbs. A glass of fresh lulo juice — pale green and frothy — sits on the tray. Valentina thanks the server with a smile. Steam rises from the stewed chicken.

### Scene 097: Sitting Down to Lunch
**Time:** 12:20 PM — bright noon light from cafeteria windows
**Setting:** Hospital cafeteria, table near window
**Description:** Valentina sits at a cafeteria table near the window, her tray set before her with the full Colombian almuerzo — rice, chicken, beans, salad, soup, and lulo juice. She sits across from a female colleague — a young doctor with black curly hair in a white coat, eating her own lunch. Bright noon sunlight streams through the window beside them, casting warm light across the table. Valentina unfolds a paper napkin onto her lap. The stainless-steel fork and spoon catch the light. Her ID badge lies on the table. Other staff fill the tables around them. The view through the window shows the parking lot and a distant ridge of green mountains under a cloudless blue tropical sky.

### Scene 098: Eating Lunch — Soup
**Time:** 12:22 PM — bright noon light
**Setting:** Hospital cafeteria, close-up on hands and bowl
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina lifting a stainless-steel spoon of golden ajiaco soup to her lips. The soup is thick and hearty — chunks of yellow potato, white corn, and green herbs float in the rich broth. Steam curls upward from the bowl. A small side dish of white rice and capers sits beside the soup bowl as traditional accompaniments. Her lips blow gently to cool the spoonful. Her silver watch is visible. The noise of the cafeteria is implied by the blurred figures in the background. A paper napkin is beside the bowl, slightly crumpled from use. The lulo juice glass is half-full.

### Scene 099: Chatting with Colleague During Lunch
**Time:** 12:35 PM — bright noon light
**Setting:** Hospital cafeteria, medium two-shot
**Description:** Valentina and her colleague lean toward each other across the table, deep in conversation. Both have partially eaten meals in front of them. Valentina gestures with her fork while making a point, a piece of chicken on the tines. Her colleague laughs, holding her juice glass. The mood is relaxed and collegial. Both white coats are pushed open, revealing blouses underneath. Empty soup bowls are pushed to the side. Through the window, the noon sun casts minimal shadows — everything is bright and evenly lit. A group of nurses at the adjacent table shares a plate of empanadas. The cafeteria is at peak capacity.

### Scene 100: Clearing Lunch Tray
**Time:** 12:50 PM — bright fluorescent cafeteria light
**Setting:** Hospital cafeteria, tray return area
**Description:** Valentina carries her tan tray — now holding empty dishes, crumpled napkin, and empty juice glass — toward the tray return window, a stainless-steel counter where dishes are stacked. She slides the tray onto the counter. A cafeteria worker behind the window takes it. The sectioned plate is clean — she ate everything. Other staff members file past with their trays. Valentina pauses to check her phone — a notification from the private clinic app reminding her of her 2:00 PM start time. She buttons her white coat and straightens her ID badge. The cafeteria is beginning to thin out as staff return to their shifts.

### Scene 101: Leaving the Hospital
**Time:** 12:55 PM — harsh noon sun
**Setting:** Hospital exit, exterior view
**Description:** Valentina pushes through the glass exit doors of the hospital into the blazing noon sun. The heat is immediate — Cali's tropical climate at its peak intensity. She squints and reaches for her sunglasses from her tote bag. The hospital building facade stretches behind her, the "HOSPITAL" sign catching the sun. The parking lot pavement radiates heat — visible as a slight shimmer. She walks toward her silver Toyota Corolla, white coat bright against the intense blue sky. A few palm trees provide small islands of shade. She pulls her car keys from the tote's side pocket. An ambulance sits idle near the emergency entrance.

---

## PART 8: DRIVING TO PRIVATE CLINIC (1:00 PM - 1:35 PM)

### Scene 102: Getting Back in the Car
**Time:** 1:00 PM — harsh noon sun, hot car interior
**Setting:** Car interior, driver's seat area
**Description:** Valentina slides into the driver's seat of the Toyota Corolla, which has been baking in the sun. She winces slightly at the hot steering wheel leather cover and turns the ignition to start the air conditioning immediately. The dashboard thermometer reads 33 degrees Celsius. She places her tote on the passenger seat. The air freshener tree hangs limp in the still air. She presses the AC button — the vents push out warm air that will soon cool. Her sunglasses are on, reflecting the parking lot. The hospital building is visible through the windshield. She adjusts the rearview mirror and waits a moment for the car to cool before pulling out.

### Scene 103: Driving Through Midday Cali
**Time:** 1:10 PM — intense overhead tropical sun, minimal shadows
**Setting:** Car interior, over-shoulder view through windshield
**Description:** Valentina drives through Cali's streets, the midday sun directly overhead casting short, stark shadows. The city is alive — more traffic than the morning commute, motorcycles and MIO buses filling the lanes. Through the windshield, a commercial district passes: storefronts with awnings in bright colors, a cell phone repair shop, a pharmacy with a green cross sign, a panaderia with its window display of pastries. Pedestrians walk under umbrellas used as sun parasols. The AC has cooled the car interior. The radio plays a cumbia song. Her phone mount shows the route to the private clinic — Clinica Vallecaucana — with 15 minutes remaining. Valentina's face is calm and focused behind her sunglasses.

### Scene 104: Stopped at Railroad Crossing
**Time:** 1:18 PM — intense midday sun
**Setting:** Car interior, view through windshield of railroad crossing
**Description:** The Toyota Corolla is stopped at a railroad crossing, red-and-white striped barriers lowered, a small crowd of vehicles waiting. Through the windshield, a freight train passes slowly — rusty boxcars and flatbeds carrying containers. The crossing signal has flashing red lights. A group of motorcyclists clusters at the front. Street vendors move between the stopped cars — a man carries a tray of sliced mango with lime, another sells bottles of water from a cooler. Valentina taps the steering wheel patiently. The sun beats down on the scene. A barefoot boy sells newspapers at a car window ahead. The train rumbles, vibrating the air.

### Scene 105: Arriving at Private Clinic
**Time:** 1:30 PM — bright afternoon sun
**Setting:** Private clinic exterior, street view
**Description:** Valentina turns the Toyota into a small parking area in front of a modern two-story medical building — Clinica Vallecaucana. The building has a clean white stucco facade with large tinted windows, a glass front door, and a small sign with the clinic name in dark blue lettering and a stylized medical cross logo. Two parking spots are marked "MEDICOS" — one is empty. Manicured hedges and a small flowering garden with purple bougainvillea frame the entrance. The building is noticeably more modern and well-maintained than the public hospital. A few patients' cars are parked along the street. Valentina parks in the empty doctor's spot.

### Scene 106: Entering the Private Clinic
**Time:** 1:33 PM — cool, bright clinic interior
**Setting:** Private clinic reception area, interior view
**Description:** Valentina walks through the glass front door of the clinic into a clean, air-conditioned reception area. The space is modern and comfortable — pale wood laminate flooring, white walls with framed landscape prints of Colombian coffee regions, upholstered gray chairs for waiting patients. A reception counter with a young woman in a navy polo — the receptionist — is straight ahead. The receptionist looks up with a smile. Fresh flowers — white lilies — sit in a clear glass vase on the counter. Soft instrumental music plays through small ceiling speakers. The contrast with the busy public hospital is notable — quieter, fewer people, more polished. Valentina removes her sunglasses and tucks them into her tote.

### Scene 107: Greeting the Receptionist
**Time:** 1:34 PM — cool clinic interior light
**Setting:** Private clinic reception counter, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina leans on the reception counter, exchanging a friendly greeting with the receptionist — a young woman with straight black hair, a navy polo with the clinic logo, and a headset. The receptionist hands Valentina a printed schedule for the afternoon — four patients listed with appointment times. Behind the receptionist, a computer shows the clinic scheduling software. A multi-line phone system sits on the desk beside a small succulent in a white pot. A wall-mounted flat-screen TV in the waiting area behind Valentina plays a nature documentary on mute. Two patients wait in the upholstered chairs — an older man reading a magazine, a young mother with a toddler on her lap. Valentina reviews the schedule as she walks toward her clinic room.

### Scene 108: Private Clinic Consultation Room
**Time:** 1:38 PM — cool, even LED ceiling light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina enters her consultation room at the private clinic — noticeably more modern than the hospital space. The walls are a soft warm beige. A large wooden desk with a slim laptop computer (not a bulky desktop) sits against one wall, an ergonomic black mesh chair behind it. The exam table is covered in white leather-look vinyl with a fresh paper sheet. A digital blood pressure monitor — compact and modern — sits on a small rolling cart beside the exam table. The room has a window with wooden blinds filtering warm afternoon sun. A small bookshelf holds medical reference books and a few decorative items — a ceramic figurine, a small plant. Valentina hangs her tote on the back of the chair and opens the laptop.

### Scene 109: First Clinic Patient — Businessman
**Time:** 2:00 PM — warm afternoon light through blinds
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, seated at desk
**Description:** Valentina sits at the wooden desk, laptop open, facing her first afternoon patient — a well-dressed middle-aged man in a button-down shirt with rolled sleeves and dress pants, a gold watch on his wrist. He sits in a padded visitor's chair across the desk. Valentina reviews his health history on the laptop screen — charts showing blood sugar levels over time. The patient gestures as he talks about his work stress and eating habits. A glass of water sits on the desk for the patient. The digital blood pressure monitor waits on the cart. Valentina writes in her blue notebook while listening, her expression engaged and professional. Warm afternoon light filters through the wooden blinds, casting horizontal stripe shadows across the desk.

### Scene 110: Measuring Patient's Weight
**Time:** 2:10 PM — even clinic room light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, by scale
**Description:** Valentina stands beside a digital floor scale — a sleek white platform with a digital readout — as the businessman steps onto it in his socked feet, his leather shoes placed aside. The digital display shows the reading. Valentina notes the number in her notebook. A height measurement rod — a vertical chrome bar with a sliding horizontal arm — stands beside the scale. The patient looks down at the display with mild concern. Valentina's expression is neutral and professional. The clinic room is organized and clean. A growth chart for children is mounted on the wall beside an adult BMI reference chart. The patient's jacket hangs on the back of his chair.

### Scene 111: Blood Draw Preparation
**Time:** 2:20 PM — even clinic light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, close-up on supply cart
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands snapping on light blue nitrile examination gloves from a box on the rolling cart. On the cart's surface, she has arranged blood draw supplies: a rubber tourniquet in bright orange, several sterile vacuum tubes with color-coded caps — purple (EDTA), red (plain), and green (lithium heparin) — cotton balls in a small dish, an alcohol swab packet, and a butterfly needle still sealed in its packaging. Her gloved hands are precise and practiced. The patient's bare forearm is visible in the background, resting on the exam table armrest. A small sharps disposal container — bright yellow with a red biohazard symbol — sits on the cart's lower shelf.

### Scene 112: Performing Blood Draw
**Time:** 2:22 PM — even clinic light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, close-up on patient's arm
**Description:** Valentina holds the patient's forearm steady with her left hand while inserting the butterfly needle into the vein at the inner elbow with her right. The orange rubber tourniquet is tied above the elbow, the veins slightly visible under the skin. A small piece of cotton is ready under her thumb. The patient looks away, grimacing slightly. The vacuum tube — the purple-capped one — is attached to the needle's tubing, and dark red blood begins to flow into it. Valentina's face is calm and focused, guiding the needle with precision. The blue nitrile gloves are taut on her hands. A small bandage strip is pre-opened on the cart, ready for application.

### Scene 113: Labeling Blood Samples
**Time:** 2:26 PM — even clinic light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, desk close-up
**Description:** Valentina sits at the desk, writing patient information on small white labels with her black pen, then affixing them to the three filled blood collection tubes. Each tube has a different colored cap. The labels include the patient's name, date, and clinic code. A cotton ball is taped to the patient's inner elbow with medical tape — a small red dot visible on the cotton. Valentina's blue nitrile gloves are now removed, sitting crumpled on the desk. The laptop screen shows the lab order form. A small zippered transport bag in clear plastic waits to hold the tubes. The afternoon light through the blinds has shifted slightly, the stripe shadows now at a different angle.

### Scene 114: Afternoon Clinic — Young Mother
**Time:** 3:00 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, desk area
**Description:** Valentina consults with a new patient — a young woman in her late twenties holding an infant wrapped in a white blanket. The baby is awake, small dark eyes looking around curiously. The mother explains something with a worried expression, her free hand gesturing. Valentina listens attentively, leaning forward. The laptop shows pediatric growth charts. A baby bottle in a small insulated bag sits on the desk. The mother wears a casual sundress with a diaper bag slung over her chair. Valentina reaches gently toward the baby, letting the infant grasp her finger. Her expression softens, warm and maternal despite her professional setting. The exam table is prepared with a fresh sheet.

### Scene 115: Examining the Infant
**Time:** 3:10 PM — warm afternoon light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, exam table
**Description:** Valentina gently examines the infant lying on the exam table on a soft blue cloth. The baby wears only a diaper, tiny limbs moving. Valentina uses a small infant stethoscope — noticeably smaller than her regular one — to listen to the baby's chest. Her left hand rests lightly on the baby's belly, feeling for anything unusual. The digital scale nearby shows the baby's weight from moments ago. A measuring tape in soft fabric lies beside the baby — just used to measure head circumference. The mother stands beside the table, hovering protectively. Valentina's expression is gentle and focused. The afternoon light creates a warm, intimate atmosphere through the blinds.

### Scene 116: Phone Call with Specialist
**Time:** 3:45 PM — warm afternoon light fading slightly
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, desk
**Description:** Valentina sits at the desk between patients, phone held to her ear, speaking with a specialist about a referral. Her free hand flips through pages in her blue notebook. The laptop screen shows a patient file. She speaks in professional medical terminology, occasionally pausing to listen and nod. The consultation room is quiet — no patient present. A cup of water sits on the desk, half-empty. The afternoon light through the blinds has shifted to a more golden hue as the sun moves westward. The wall clock shows 3:45. Her white coat is slightly wrinkled after hours of wear. She makes a note in the margin of her notebook, then thanks the specialist and hangs up.

### Scene 117: Last Clinic Patient
**Time:** 4:15 PM — golden afternoon light through blinds
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, exam area
**Description:** Valentina examines her last patient of the day — an elderly man with thick gray hair and a mustache, wearing a guayabera shirt. He sits on the exam table while Valentina checks his reflexes, tapping his knee with a small rubber reflex hammer. His leg kicks forward slightly in response. Valentina nods approvingly. A cane leans against the exam table — the patient needs it for walking. His wife sits in the visitor's chair, a woven bag on her lap. The golden afternoon light through the blinds paints warm horizontal stripes across the scene. Valentina's face shows the gentle fatigue of a long day, but her attention to the patient is unwavering.

### Scene 118: Completing Clinic Notes
**Time:** 4:45 PM — golden late-afternoon light
**Setting:** Private clinic consultation room, desk
**Description:** Valentina types rapidly on the laptop, completing the clinical notes for her afternoon patients. The screen shows the electronic medical record system — different from the hospital's, cleaner in design. Her blue notebook lies open beside the laptop, her handwritten notes serving as reference. The three blood collection tubes in their labeled transport bag sit on the desk corner, ready for the lab. Her stethoscope lies coiled beside the laptop. She stretches her shoulders, rolling them back, then continues typing. The golden light through the blinds has deepened. The desk lamp — a small chrome adjustable arm lamp — is now switched on, adding warm task light. The wall clock reads 4:45.

### Scene 119: Saying Goodbye to Clinic Staff
**Time:** 5:00 PM — golden-orange late afternoon light
**Setting:** Private clinic reception area, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina stands at the reception counter, chatting with the receptionist as she prepares to leave. She hands over the transport bag of blood samples for lab pickup. The receptionist takes the bag with a smile and places it in a small insulated cooler behind the desk. Valentina buttons her white coat's top button, tote bag on her shoulder. The clinic waiting room is now empty — afternoon appointments are finished. The flat-screen TV still plays on mute. Golden-orange late afternoon light streams through the clinic's front windows, painting long warm rectangles on the pale wood floor. Valentina waves goodbye and heads toward the glass door.

---

## PART 9: LEAVING CLINIC AND GROCERY SHOPPING (5:00 PM - 6:30 PM)

### Scene 120: Removing White Coat at Car
**Time:** 5:03 PM — warm golden late-afternoon light
**Setting:** Clinic parking area, beside car
**Description:** Valentina stands beside her silver Toyota Corolla in the clinic parking area, removing her white doctor's coat. She folds it carefully and places it in the back seat through the open rear door. Underneath, her gray silk blouse and navy pants are slightly wrinkled from the long day. She removes the medical ID badge and places it in the tote bag. The late afternoon sun casts long golden shadows from the clinic building across the small parking area. The purple bougainvillea at the clinic entrance glows in the warm light. She rolls her shoulders and tilts her neck — a small release after hours of clinical work. Her hair is still in the neat bun, though a few strands have escaped around her temples.

### Scene 121: Driving to Supermarket
**Time:** 5:15 PM — golden afternoon light, long shadows
**Setting:** Car interior, over-shoulder through windshield
**Description:** Valentina drives through Cali's late-afternoon streets, sunglasses on, heading toward the supermarket. The late sun is low, casting long golden beams between buildings and across the windshield. Through the glass, the city passes — a mix of residential and commercial, pedestrians carrying shopping bags, a fruit stand with pyramids of oranges and guanabanas. The AC is on, the car interior comfortable. Her phone mount shows directions to "Exito — Calle 9." She no longer wears the white coat — just the gray blouse with the top button undone, looking more relaxed. The radio plays a vallenato ballad. Traffic is heavier than the midday drive — rush hour is beginning.

### Scene 122: Arriving at Supermarket Parking
**Time:** 5:30 PM — golden-orange late afternoon light
**Setting:** Supermarket parking lot, exterior view
**Description:** The silver Toyota pulls into the parking lot of an Exito supermarket — a large modern building with a bright yellow-and-red facade and the "exito" logo in lowercase letters. The parking lot is moderately full. Valentina finds a spot near the entrance and parks. She grabs a reusable cloth shopping bag from the back seat — navy blue with white handles — and her wallet from the tote. She leaves the tote in the car, locking it with the fob. The late afternoon sun paints the supermarket's yellow facade in warm amber tones. Shopping carts are lined up near the entrance. A security guard in a navy uniform stands at the entrance. People push carts in and out.

### Scene 123: Entering the Supermarket
**Time:** 5:33 PM — bright fluorescent supermarket interior
**Setting:** Supermarket entrance, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina walks through the automatic sliding glass doors of the Exito into the bright, air-conditioned interior. The transition from warm golden outdoor light to cool fluorescent white is immediate. She grabs a small cart — a red plastic basket on wheels — and heads past the produce section entrance. The store is wide with tall ceiling shelving and bright signage in Spanish: "FRUTAS Y VERDURAS," "PANADERIA," "CARNES." Promotional signs hang from the ceiling — "2x1 en yogurts." The floor is white tile, well-lit. Other shoppers push carts — families, elderly couples, young professionals still in work clothes like Valentina. She pulls out her phone, checking a digital shopping list.

### Scene 124: Selecting Produce — Vegetables
**Time:** 5:35 PM — bright produce section lighting
**Setting:** Supermarket produce section, close-up on hands
**Description:** Valentina stands before a tilted display of fresh vegetables, her hand selecting firm red tomatoes and placing them in a clear plastic bag. The produce section is a colorful display — green lettuce, purple eggplants, yellow peppers, orange carrots, bunches of cilantro and green onions, all misted with fine water droplets to keep them fresh. She squeezes an avocado, testing ripeness — her experienced hands choose one that yields slightly. The digital scale nearby shows a price per kilo. Her rolling basket already holds a bunch of cilantro and three plantains — the green cooking variety. She checks her phone list between selections.

### Scene 125: Selecting Produce — Tropical Fruit
**Time:** 5:38 PM — bright produce section lighting
**Setting:** Supermarket produce section, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina moves to the fruit displays, picking up a ripe mango and holding it to her nose, smelling for ripeness. The fruit section offers a rainbow of tropical options: papayas the size of footballs, passion fruit (maracuya) with wrinkled purple shells, lulo — small orange fruits with fuzzy skin — green limes piled high, and yellow pineapples with their green crowns. She selects two mangos, a papaya, and a bag of lulo. A scale with a digital price display hangs above the fruit bins. Other shoppers browse nearby. Valentina's cloth shopping bag hangs on the cart handle. The rolling basket is filling up with colorful produce — a vivid palette of tropical colors.

### Scene 126: At the Meat Counter
**Time:** 5:42 PM — bright butcher section lighting
**Setting:** Supermarket meat/deli counter, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina stands at the glass-fronted meat counter, pointing to a cut of chicken breast displayed on a stainless-steel tray behind the glass. A butcher in a white coat and plastic gloves slices the chicken on a cutting board. Trays of various meats are arranged in the cold display — pork chops, ground beef, whole chickens, chorizo links in red casings, and fresh fish on ice. A digital ticket dispenser shows number 47 — Valentina's turn. The butcher wraps her chicken in white paper, then places it in a clear plastic bag, weighing it on a chrome scale. A printed price sticker is affixed to the bag. She thanks the butcher and places the chicken in her basket.

### Scene 127: Browsing the Dairy Aisle
**Time:** 5:47 PM — cool fluorescent aisle light
**Setting:** Supermarket dairy aisle, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina walks down the refrigerated dairy aisle, her hand reaching into the cold case for a carton of milk. The glass-fronted refrigerators line one side, illuminated from within by bright white LEDs, showing rows of products — milk cartons, yogurt tubs, cheese blocks wrapped in plastic, butter, and fresh cream. She selects a carton of Alqueria brand whole milk with a red-and-white label, and a small tub of natural yogurt. Her basket now holds produce, chicken, and these dairy items. The aisle floor reflects the bright overhead lights. A promotional display of imported cheese sits at the aisle end. She checks the expiration date on the milk carton, turning it to read the side.

### Scene 128: Checkout Line
**Time:** 5:55 PM — bright checkout area lighting
**Setting:** Supermarket checkout, medium shot
**Description:** Valentina stands in the checkout line, her rolling basket on the conveyor belt. The cashier — a young man in a red Exito polo — scans items one by one with a barcode scanner that beeps with each pass. Items move along the belt: tomatoes in a bag, plantains, mangos, papaya, lulo, chicken in its white-paper package, milk carton, yogurt tub, a bag of rice, a bottle of cooking oil. A bagger — a teenage boy in a matching red polo — places items into Valentina's navy cloth shopping bag. The register screen shows a running total in Colombian pesos. Valentina has her wallet out, a debit card in hand. Behind her, a short line of other customers wait with their carts.

### Scene 129: Paying with Debit Card
**Time:** 5:58 PM — bright checkout lighting
**Setting:** Supermarket checkout, close-up on payment terminal
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand inserting her blue debit card into a payment terminal mounted on the checkout counter. The small screen prompts for a PIN. Her other hand shields the keypad as she enters the four-digit code. The terminal has a logo of a Colombian bank — Bancolombia. The total on the register screen reads $87,500 COP. The cashier waits, looking at his screen. Valentina's silver watch is visible on her wrist. A receipt printer beside the register prepares to print. The navy cloth bag, now heavy with groceries, sits in the bagging area. A small display of candy and gum sits beside the register — impulse purchases she passes over.

### Scene 130: Loading Groceries in Car
**Time:** 6:02 PM — deep golden sunset light
**Setting:** Supermarket parking lot, beside car
**Description:** Valentina opens the rear door of the Toyota Corolla and places the full navy cloth shopping bag on the back seat beside her folded white coat. A second plastic bag with heavier items — the milk carton and rice — goes on the floor behind the passenger seat. The late afternoon sun is now deep gold, nearing sunset — the sky above the supermarket shows orange and pink streaks. The parking lot lights have begun to flicker on in anticipation of dusk. Valentina closes the rear door, walks to the driver's side, and opens the door. The car interior is warm from sitting in the sun but not as hot as midday. She starts the engine and the AC.

### Scene 131: Driving Home at Sunset
**Time:** 6:10 PM — golden-orange sunset light
**Setting:** Car interior, view through windshield
**Description:** Valentina drives through Cali's streets at sunset, the sky a spectacular display of orange, pink, and purple above the city's low skyline and distant mountain silhouettes of the Cordillera Occidental. The sun sits just above the mountains, casting everything in warm golden-orange light. Through the windshield, the city glows — building facades in warm tones, palm trees as black silhouettes, headlights of oncoming cars beginning to switch on. The streets are busy with evening traffic. She has removed her sunglasses as the sun is no longer harsh. The radio plays softly. Her face is lit by the warm sunset glow, expression relaxed — the workday is over. The phone mount shows 12 minutes to home.

### Scene 132: Parking at Home
**Time:** 6:25 PM — dusk, last traces of sunset, streetlights on
**Setting:** Apartment building parking garage entrance, exterior
**Description:** The silver Toyota Corolla turns into the apartment building's underground parking garage entrance as dusk settles over El Penon. The sky behind the building is a deep purple-blue with a thin line of orange at the western horizon. Streetlights along the road glow warm yellow. The parking garage entrance has a bright fluorescent light above the descending ramp. Valentina's headlights illuminate the ramp ahead. The apartment building's pale yellow facade is visible above, a few apartment windows lit from within. The security booth is empty — the day guard has been replaced by automated barrier access. She holds her access card toward the reader.

### Scene 133: Carrying Groceries Upstairs
**Time:** 6:28 PM — apartment hallway fluorescent light
**Setting:** Apartment building elevator, interior
**Description:** Valentina stands inside the small elevator, the navy cloth shopping bag heavy in one hand and the plastic bag in the other. Her tote bag hangs from her shoulder. The elevator interior has a stainless steel panel with floor buttons — she has pressed "4." A small mirror on the back wall shows her reflection: hair slightly loosened from the bun after the long day, blouse wrinkled, but her expression is peaceful. The elevator hums as it rises. The floor indicator above the doors lights up: 2... 3... 4. A fluorescent panel casts flat white light. The folded white coat drapes over one arm. A faint ding announces her floor.

### Scene 134: Entering Apartment — Evening
**Time:** 6:30 PM — warm apartment light, dusk through windows
**Setting:** Valentina's apartment entryway and kitchen, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina pushes open her apartment door with her shoulder, hands full of grocery bags. She sets the bags on the kitchen counter with a sigh of relief. The apartment is dim — only the dusk light through the windows illuminates the space in deep blue-purple tones. She flips on the kitchen light — a warm overhead fixture that fills the space with golden-white light. The apartment feels quiet and still after the day's bustle. The console table at the entry holds the key bowl and reed diffuser. She drops her car keys into the bowl with a small ceramic clink. The tote bag goes onto the kitchen counter beside the groceries. The white coat is draped over a dining chair.

## PART 10: EVENING AT HOME (6:30 PM - 10:30 PM)

### Scene 135: Removing Work Outfit
**Time:** 6:33 PM — warm bedroom lamp light, dark blue dusk through window
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, view toward closet
**Description:** Valentina stands in her bedroom, unbuttoning her gray silk blouse. She slides it off her shoulders and places it on a wooden hanger, smoothing the fabric before hanging it in the open mirrored closet. She steps out of the navy dress pants, folding them over a second hanger and placing them beside the blouse. The bedroom lamp on the nightstand casts a warm amber glow. Through the sheer curtains, the sky is deep blue-purple with the last traces of dusk. She stands in a simple white camisole and underwear, her silhouette reflected in the closet mirror. The tan leather flats are kicked off near the dresser. The bed behind her is still unmade from the morning.

### Scene 136: Letting Hair Down
**Time:** 6:34 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, facing dresser mirror
**Description:** Valentina reaches both hands behind her head and pulls the black elastic from her bun, wincing slightly as it catches a few strands. Her long dark wavy hair cascades down her shoulders and back, slightly crimped and indented from being tied tightly all day. She runs her fingers through it slowly, working out the shape of the bun, shaking it loose. The bobby pins come out one by one — she drops them into a small ceramic dish on the dresser. Her reflection in the dresser mirror shows the transformation — the structured professional giving way to the relaxed woman underneath. She tilts her head side to side, letting the hair settle naturally. Her expression relaxes visibly.

### Scene 137: Putting on Comfortable Clothes
**Time:** 6:35 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, full-length mirror view
**Description:** Valentina pulls soft black yoga pants from a drawer in her dark wood dresser and steps into them, then tugs a loose rust-orange cotton T-shirt over her head, her dark wavy hair spilling over the collar. She checks her reflection in the full-length mirror leaned against the wall — the comfortable evening outfit, bare feet on the terracotta tile. She looks noticeably different from her professional morning self — softer, more relaxed, hair loose and natural. The closet door is now closed, the mirrored surface reflecting the warm lamp glow. The oscillating fan on the dresser turns slowly, its gentle breeze stirring the ends of her loose hair. The bedside phone lights up with a notification — she glances but does not pick it up yet.

### Scene 138: Removing Watch and Earrings
**Time:** 6:36 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, close-up on dresser top
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands at the dark wood dresser. She unclasps the silver watch from her left wrist and lays it flat on the dresser surface, its face catching the lamplight. Then she reaches for her left ear, pinching the back of a small silver stud earring and sliding it free. The right earring follows. Both are placed carefully into a small white ceramic dish beside the bobby pins. Her bare wrist shows a faint tan line where the watch sat all day. The dresser surface holds these small personal items — the dish, the watch, a bottle of perfume, and a framed photo of her with Andres. Her hands look different without the accessories — simpler, more at ease. The rust-orange T-shirt sleeve is visible at the edge of the frame.

### Scene 139: Unpacking Groceries
**Time:** 6:38 PM — warm kitchen overhead light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, view of counter and open refrigerator
**Description:** Valentina stands at the kitchen counter, unpacking the navy cloth shopping bag. The refrigerator door is open, its interior light casting cool white across the terracotta tile. She places items methodically — the milk carton and yogurt tub on the middle shelf, the chicken breast in the meat drawer, the vegetables in the crisper. On the counter, the tropical fruit — mangos, papaya, lulo — stays out to ripen or be used tonight. The bag of rice goes in a lower cabinet. The cooking oil finds its spot beside the stove. The kitchen window shows the dark evening outside, her reflection in the glass. The French press from this morning sits on the counter, still unwashed.

### Scene 140: Washing the French Press
**Time:** 6:42 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, at the sink
**Description:** Valentina stands at the kitchen sink, washing the French press from breakfast. She disassembles the chrome plunger, rinsing the filter screen under running water. Dark coffee grounds swirl into the sink drain. The glass carafe is washed with a green sponge and a squirt of dish soap from a bottle beside the faucet. Steam rises slightly from the warm water. The clean dishes from breakfast — the white plate and mug — are dry on the drying rack. She places the clean French press parts on the rack to dry. Through the window above the sink, city lights twinkle in the distance. Her dark wavy hair catches the warm overhead light.

### Scene 141: Preparing Dinner — Washing Vegetables
**Time:** 6:50 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, sink area
**Description:** Valentina washes vegetables in a colander under running water at the kitchen sink — red tomatoes, green peppers, and a bunch of fresh cilantro. Water splashes over the bright colors. The colander is stainless steel, its holes letting water drain. On the counter beside her, the bamboo cutting board is out, the chef's knife beside it. Two cloves of garlic and a white onion sit on the counter, unpeeled. The chicken breast from the supermarket is on a white plate, removed from its packaging, resting at room temperature. She turns off the water and sets the colander on the counter. A blue-and-white striped dish towel hangs from her shoulder.

### Scene 142: Chopping Vegetables
**Time:** 6:55 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, close-up on cutting board
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hands dicing a white onion on the bamboo cutting board with the chef's knife. Her technique is confident — fingers curled back in the proper safe grip, the knife rocking in efficient cuts. Small white onion cubes accumulate on the board. A tear tracks down her cheek from the onion's fumes. Beside the board, the red tomatoes are quartered, the green pepper is sliced into strips, and the cilantro is in a rough chop. The garlic cloves are minced — tiny pale pieces in a neat pile. The kitchen smells of raw onion and herbs. The granite countertop surrounds the cutting board. Her loose dark hair falls forward slightly — she pushes it back behind her ear with the back of her wrist.

### Scene 143: Heating Oil in Pan
**Time:** 7:00 PM — warm kitchen light, stove flame glow
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, stove area
**Description:** Valentina stands at the gas stove, pouring a thin stream of cooking oil into a large non-stick pan. The blue gas flame flickers under the pan, its glow reflected in the pan's surface. She tilts the pan to distribute the oil evenly. On the counter beside the stove, the chopped vegetables are arranged in small bowls — a mise en place of onion cubes, garlic, tomato quarters, and pepper strips. The chicken breast sits on the white plate, now patted dry and seasoned with salt and a sprinkle of cumin. A wooden spoon rests in a ceramic spoon rest beside the stove. The overhead range hood light adds additional warm illumination. The stove has four burners, two currently in use — the other holds a small pot of water beginning to heat for rice.

### Scene 144: Cooking Chicken
**Time:** 7:05 PM — warm kitchen light, sizzling pan sounds implied
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, close-up on stove
**Description:** Close-up of the chicken breast sizzling in the hot pan, its surface turning golden-brown. Valentina uses metal tongs to press the chicken gently, checking the sear. Small bubbles of oil dance around the meat's edges. The onion and garlic have been added to the pan around the chicken — they are translucent and golden, releasing aroma. Wisps of steam and the faintest hint of smoke rise from the pan. Valentina's hand is steady with the tongs. The blue gas flame is visible beneath the pan edge. In the background, the pot of water has come to a rolling boil, white rice just added. A wooden spoon rests across the rice pot. Her rust-orange T-shirt sleeve is pushed up above her elbow.

### Scene 145: Adding Tomatoes and Peppers
**Time:** 7:10 PM — warm kitchen light, steam rising
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, medium shot at stove
**Description:** Valentina adds the quartered tomatoes and green pepper strips to the pan around the chicken, using the wooden spoon to stir them in. The vegetables sizzle and pop as they hit the hot oil. The tomatoes begin to break down, creating a rich red sauce that pools around the chicken. She sprinkles chopped cilantro over the top — the green herb bright against the red and gold. The kitchen smells of cooking tomato, onion, garlic, and seared chicken. On the adjacent burner, the rice simmers under a tilted lid, steam escaping in gentle puffs. A timer on her phone, propped against the backsplash, shows 12 minutes remaining. The stove area is warm and vibrant.

### Scene 146: Setting the Table
**Time:** 7:20 PM — warm overhead light, apartment fully dark outside
**Setting:** Valentina's dining area, small table
**Description:** Valentina sets her small round wooden dining table for one. She places a white ceramic dinner plate in the center, flanked by a stainless-steel fork and knife on a folded paper napkin. A tall glass is filled with water from the filtered pitcher. She adds a second glass and pours fresh lulo juice from a blender jug — the pale green liquid is frothy. A small ceramic bowl for rice sits beside the plate. The table's single yellow flower in its vase remains from morning. She adjusts the placement, centering everything neatly. Through the window beside the table, the night is fully dark — city lights sparkle in the distance, and the silhouette of distant mountains is barely visible against the deep blue-black sky.

### Scene 147: Plating Dinner
**Time:** 7:25 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, counter area
**Description:** Valentina uses a spatula to lift the golden-brown chicken breast from the pan onto the white dinner plate. She spoons the tomato-pepper sauce over and around the chicken, the rich red-orange sauce pooling on the white ceramic. A mound of fluffy white rice goes into the small ceramic bowl from the pot, pressed and turned out in a neat dome. She garnishes the chicken with a pinch of fresh cilantro leaves — bright green against the red. A few slices of ripe avocado, fanned in an arc, complete the plate — their pale green flesh and dark skin adding contrast. She wipes the rim of the plate with the dish towel for a clean presentation. The meal looks colorful and wholesome.

### Scene 148: Eating Dinner
**Time:** 7:28 PM — warm dining area light, dark night outside
**Setting:** Valentina's dining table, seated view
**Description:** Valentina sits at the small round table, cutting into the chicken breast with her knife and fork. The meat is juicy inside, steam rising from the cut. She pairs a piece of chicken with rice on her fork. Her tablet is propped up again, this time showing a Colombian drama series on Netflix — paused at a scene with subtitles visible. The lulo juice glass is half-full. The plate is colorful — the browns and reds of the chicken and sauce, the white of the rice, the green of the avocado and cilantro. She eats slowly, savoring the food after the long day. Her dark wavy hair falls around her shoulders. The apartment is quiet except for the faint hum of the oscillating fan in the bedroom.

### Scene 149: Video Call with Partner
**Time:** 8:00 PM — warm living room lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, seated on sofa
**Description:** Valentina sits on the gray linen sofa, legs tucked under her, her laptop open on the glass coffee table. The screen shows a video call — a man's face, Andres, smiling from what appears to be a dimly lit apartment in another city. Valentina's face is animated, laughing at something he said. Her dark wavy hair is pushed to one side. The living room is warmly lit by a floor lamp with a linen shade in the corner. The bookshelf behind her shows medical texts and family photos. The woven Colombian textile throw pillow is behind her back. A cup of herbal tea — chamomile, the pale yellow liquid visible — sits on the coffee table beside the laptop. The apartment feels cozy and intimate in the lamplight.

### Scene 150: Laughing on Video Call
**Time:** 8:15 PM — warm lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, close-up on face and laptop screen
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's face mid-laugh, her head tilted back slightly, eyes crinkled. The laptop screen fills the lower portion of the frame, showing Andres also laughing — his face warmly lit on his end. The video call interface shows the call duration: 15:32. Small icons for mute, camera, and end call are visible at the bottom of the screen. Valentina's hand rests on her collarbone as she laughs. Her tea cup is now nearly empty. The warm lamplight behind her creates a soft halo effect in her dark wavy hair. The moment captures genuine connection across distance — both faces radiant with shared joy.

### Scene 151: Saying Goodnight to Partner
**Time:** 8:30 PM — warm lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, medium shot of sofa and laptop
**Description:** Valentina leans toward the laptop screen, pressing her fingers to her lips and then touching the screen — a virtual kiss gesture. Andres mirrors the gesture from his side. Both faces show warm, slightly sad expressions — the bittersweet reality of a long-distance relationship. The call duration shows 30:15. Valentina waves with a small, tender smile. Her other hand holds the empty tea cup. The living room is quiet and warm. She clicks the red "End Call" button and the screen returns to the video app's home page. She sits back against the sofa cushions for a moment, looking at the dark screen thoughtfully, then closes the laptop gently.

### Scene 152: Washing Dinner Plates and Pan
**Time:** 8:35 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, at the sink
**Description:** Valentina stands at the kitchen sink, washing the dinner dishes under warm running water. She starts with the white dinner plate, scrubbing it with the green sponge and a squirt of dish soap, suds foaming across the ceramic surface. The rice bowl follows, then the non-stick pan — she uses the soft side of the sponge on the pan's coating, carefully removing the remnants of tomato sauce and browned chicken bits. Water splashes against the stainless-steel basin. The fork, knife, spatula, and wooden spoon are washed quickly in succession. Each cleaned item is placed on the chrome drying rack beside the sink. Through the window above, the city lights of Cali twinkle in the darkness. The leftover rice is covered in plastic wrap in the refrigerator, visible through the slightly ajar door.

### Scene 153: Rinsing Glasses and Drying Rack
**Time:** 8:40 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, close-up at sink and drying rack
**Description:** Valentina rinses the tall water glass under the stream of warm water, turning it upside down to let the water cascade out, then places it inverted on the drying rack. The lulo juice glass comes next — a pale green residue clings to the inside until the sponge scrubs it clean. She rinses it thoroughly and sets it beside the water glass on the rack. The drying rack is now full — plates leaned vertically, the pan balanced on end, glasses upside down, utensils in the small compartment. Water drips steadily from the clean dishes onto the rack's drip tray. She turns off the faucet with a squeak of the chrome handle. The sink basin is rinsed clean with a final splash. The blue-and-white striped dish towel is draped over her shoulder, slightly damp.

### Scene 154: Wiping Down Counters and Stove
**Time:** 8:42 PM — warm kitchen light
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, medium shot at counter
**Description:** Valentina wrings out the dish towel under the faucet, then wipes down the granite countertops in long, even strokes, clearing away crumbs and small spills from the dinner preparation. She moves methodically from one end of the counter to the other. The stove burners are off, the blue gas flames long extinguished, the chrome knobs aligned to their off positions. She wipes the stovetop as well, removing a small splatter of tomato sauce near the back burner. The cutting board is washed and leaned against the backsplash to dry. The dish soap bottle is returned to its spot by the faucet. The cooking oil goes back in the lower cabinet. The countertops gleam under the warm overhead light, granite flecks of mica catching the illumination.

### Scene 155: Hanging Towel and Switching Off Kitchen Light
**Time:** 8:45 PM — warm kitchen light transitioning to darkness
**Setting:** Valentina's kitchen, wide shot
**Description:** Valentina folds the blue-and-white striped dish towel neatly into thirds and hangs it over the oven door handle, smoothing it so it drapes evenly. She takes a step back and surveys the kitchen — the drying rack full of clean dishes, the empty sink, the spotless counters, the dark window reflecting the tidy room back at her. Everything is orderly and clean, restored to the way she found it this morning. She gives a small, satisfied nod. Her hand reaches for the light switch on the wall by the kitchen entrance. The overhead fixture clicks off, and the kitchen plunges into darkness except for the soft warm glow from the living room floor lamp filtering through the open-plan layout, casting gentle shadows across the granite counters.

### Scene 156: Reading Medical Journal on Sofa
**Time:** 8:50 PM — warm floor lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, sofa
**Description:** Valentina sits on the gray sofa, legs curled beneath her, reading a medical journal — a physical publication with a glossy cover showing a scientific photograph and the title "Revista Colombiana de Medicina" in blue text. She holds the journal in her left hand, a highlighter in her right — fluorescent yellow strokes mark important passages. Her blue notebook lies open on the coffee table, a pen beside it for taking notes. The floor lamp illuminates the reading material from behind her shoulder. Her dark wavy hair is pulled to one side, falling over the sofa arm. A fresh cup of herbal tea steams on the coffee table. The bookshelf behind her is a warm backdrop of spines and photos. Her expression is studious and engaged.

### Scene 157: Taking Notes from Journal
**Time:** 9:05 PM — warm lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, close-up on notebook and journal
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's hand writing in the blue notebook, her neat cursive filling the lined page. Medical terminology is visible — drug names, dosages, treatment protocols. The medical journal lies open beside the notebook, the highlighted passage providing the reference. Her handwriting is small and precise — a doctor's note-taking style. The pen is a black ballpoint with a silver clip. The coffee table glass surface reflects the warm lamp light. The highlighter lies across the journal's spine. A bookmark — a thin cardboard strip from a bookstore — marks another page. The tea cup shows the tea bag string draped over the rim. Her wrist shows the faint tan line where her watch usually sits.

### Scene 158: Calling Her Mother
**Time:** 9:20 PM — warm lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, medium shot on sofa
**Description:** Valentina sits sideways on the sofa, phone pressed to her ear, speaking with her mother. Her face shows a series of expressions — listening, smiling, rolling her eyes playfully, nodding. She speaks in rapid Spanish, the conversation warm and familiar. The medical journal is closed on the coffee table, the notebook tucked beneath it — study time is over. Her bare feet are tucked under the woven throw blanket. One hand twirls a strand of dark wavy hair absently. The living room is quiet and peaceful. Through the window, the dark night sky and city lights provide the backdrop. She laughs at something her mother says, her whole face lighting up.

### Scene 159: Repacking Tomorrow's Work Bag
**Time:** 9:35 PM — warm living room lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's living room, standing by coffee table
**Description:** Valentina stands beside the glass coffee table, repacking her black leather tote for tomorrow. She places the blue-covered notebook and two black ballpoint pens inside, then the stethoscope — coiled neatly, its dark gray tubing folded into a smooth loop. Her wallet — brown leather with a brass clasp — goes in the interior pocket. She checks the tote for anything from today — finds a crumpled receipt and a pen cap, which she discards into a small wastebasket beside the sofa. The medical journal goes in last — she will read more during her break tomorrow. She zips the tote's main compartment and sets it on the floor beside the sofa, upright and ready for morning. The living room is warm and quiet, the bookshelf and family photos providing a familiar backdrop.

### Scene 160: Returning White Coat to Closet
**Time:** 9:38 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, by closet
**Description:** Valentina picks up the white doctor's coat from the back of the dining chair where she draped it hours ago. She carries it down the short hallway to the bedroom, the fabric crisp but showing the day's slight wrinkles. At the open mirrored closet, she hangs the coat on its dedicated hook on the inside of the closet door. The medical ID badge is still clipped to the breast pocket — "Dra. Valentina Restrepo" visible in dark blue text beneath the hospital crest. She straightens the coat on the hanger so it hangs flat, smoothing the lapels. The embroidered name catches the warm lamplight. She pauses for a moment, looking at the coat — the symbol of her professional self, now put away for the night. The closet door slides closed, the mirror reflecting the dim bedroom behind her.

### Scene 161: Evening Skincare — Removing Makeup
**Time:** 9:45 PM — bright bathroom vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Valentina stands at the bathroom vanity, using a cotton round soaked in micellar water to gently remove the day's makeup from her face. The cotton pad shows traces of mascara and concealer. Her eyes are closed as she wipes across her eyelid. The micellar water bottle — a French pharmacy brand — sits on the counter with its cap off. A small stack of fresh cotton rounds waits beside it. Her dark wavy hair is pulled back with a soft pink terrycloth headband that keeps it off her face. She wears the rust-orange T-shirt and black yoga pants. The vanity sconce lights illuminate her face evenly. The pink orchid blooms in the corner. A used cotton round lies discarded on the counter.

### Scene 162: Applying Night Cream
**Time:** 9:48 PM — bright vanity light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, close-up on face
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina applying a rich white night cream to her face, using her fingertips in small circular motions across her cheeks, forehead, and chin. Her skin is clean and bare — no makeup, pores visible, the natural beauty of her olive complexion. The night cream jar — a small glass pot with a silver lid — sits open on the counter. She pats the cream gently under her eyes with her ring fingers. The pink headband still holds her hair back. Her expression is peaceful and meditative — this nightly ritual is her moment of self-care. The mirror reflects her face and the warm bathroom behind her. The exhaustion of the long day shows in the slight shadows under her eyes.

### Scene 163: Brushing Teeth — Evening
**Time:** 9:52 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, facing mirror
**Description:** Valentina brushes her teeth with an electric toothbrush — a white handle with a small round oscillating head. White toothpaste foam is visible at the corners of her mouth. She looks at herself in the mirror, eyes slightly glazed with tiredness. The toothbrush buzzes softly. She wears the pink headband, the rust-orange shirt, yoga pants. The toothpaste tube — a white-and-green tube — lies on its side on the counter. A small cup for rinsing sits beside the chrome faucet. The bathroom is otherwise quiet. The overhead exhaust fan is off. She brushes methodically — upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left — the pattern of someone who listened to dental hygiene lectures in medical school.

### Scene 164: Rinsing and Spitting
**Time:** 9:54 PM — bright bathroom light
**Setting:** Valentina's bathroom, side angle at sink
**Description:** Valentina leans over the sink, cupping water from the running faucet in her hand, rinsing her mouth. She spits the white foam into the porcelain basin, water swirling it away. She rinses once more, then wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. The electric toothbrush is back in its charging stand on the counter — a small white base with a blue light indicating charging. She removes the pink headband, shaking her dark hair loose. The cotton rounds and micellar water have been put away. The night cream jar is capped. She runs her hand over her face — clean, moisturized, ready for sleep. She turns off the vanity lights, leaving just the hallway light to guide her to bed.

### Scene 165: Setting Out Tomorrow's Running Clothes
**Time:** 9:58 PM — warm bedroom lamp light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, view of dresser
**Description:** Valentina pulls out running clothes from her dresser drawer — a fresh pair of dark athletic leggings and a light purple moisture-wicking tank top — and lays them on top of the dresser for tomorrow's early morning run. Her running shoes — the white-and-teal pair, cleaned from this morning — are placed beside the dresser on the terracotta tile. The black phone armband and the small key pouch are set beside the clothes. This pre-staging means she can dress in the dark without disturbing her routine. The oscillating fan turns slowly on the dresser corner. The bedroom lamp casts warm amber light across the neatly arranged items. Her white wireless earbuds sit in their charging case on the nightstand.

### Scene 166: Pulling Back the Bed Covers
**Time:** 10:00 PM — warm bedroom lamp light, dark windows
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, view of bed
**Description:** Valentina pulls back the white cotton duvet and light blue sheets on her bed, folding the duvet down to the foot. She fluffs the two pillows — patting them into comfortable shape. The bed is finally being made in a sense — prepared for sleep rather than the day. The nightstand lamp provides the only light — a warm amber circle in the otherwise dim room. Through the sheer curtains, the night is fully dark, punctuated by the faint glow of distant city lights. The framed watercolor of San Antonio hangs above, barely visible in the dim light. The oscillating fan provides gentle air movement. She smooths the blue sheet with her palm.

### Scene 167: Checking Phone — Setting Alarm
**Time:** 10:05 PM — nightstand lamp glow and phone screen light
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, seated on bed edge
**Description:** Valentina sits on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, scrolling through her notifications before sleep. The screen shows several WhatsApp messages — one from "Mama" (a heart emoji), one from "Clinica Vallecaucana" (a schedule update), one from a group chat called "Amigas" (several unread messages). She opens the alarm app and confirms the 5:30 AM alarm is set — the toggle is green. She plugs the phone charger — a white USB-C cable — into the phone and places it face-down on the nightstand. The charger cord trails to a power strip behind the nightstand. The lamp glow illuminates her relaxed face. Her dark wavy hair spreads across her shoulders. She stifles a yawn with the back of her hand.

### Scene 168: Getting into Bed
**Time:** 10:08 PM — warm nightstand lamp glow
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, side view of bed
**Description:** Valentina slides her legs under the light blue sheets and pulls the white cotton duvet up to her waist. She wears a clean light gray sleep tank top — changed from the rust-orange T-shirt. She settles against the pillows, adjusting them behind her back for a semi-reclined position. The nightstand lamp bathes the scene in warm amber. A novel — a paperback with a colorful cover depicting a Colombian village scene — sits on the nightstand. She reaches for it, opening to a dog-eared page. Her bare shoulders emerge from the tank top. The white wireless earbuds case sits closed on the nightstand. The dark window shows nothing but the faint reflection of the lamp in the glass.

### Scene 169: Reading Before Sleep
**Time:** 10:12 PM — warm nightstand lamp glow
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, close-up on reading
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina propped against the pillows, holding the paperback novel open with both hands. Her eyes move across the Spanish text. Her expression is relaxed, a faint smile suggesting the story is pleasant. The book's pages are slightly yellowed — it is well-read, perhaps borrowed from her mother. Her dark wavy hair fans across the white pillow. The duvet is pulled to her chest. The nightstand lamp creates a warm pool of light around her. The rest of the bedroom fades into soft darkness. The oscillating fan creates a gentle breeze that occasionally flutters the page corners. She turns a page, the paper crinkling softly.

### Scene 170: Putting the Book Down
**Time:** 10:22 PM — warm nightstand lamp glow
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, side view
**Description:** Valentina lowers the book, dog-earing the new page she has reached, and places it on the nightstand beside the phone and earbuds case. She slides down the pillows from her semi-reclined position to lying flat, pulling the duvet up to her shoulders. A long, slow exhale — the final release of the day's tension. Her dark hair spreads across the white pillow. She blinks slowly, eyes heavy. The lamp still glows. The fan still turns. The silence of the apartment surrounds her. She reaches one arm toward the nightstand lamp, fingers finding the small switch at the lamp base.

### Scene 171: Turning Off the Lamp
**Time:** 10:25 PM — transitioning from warm lamp glow to darkness
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, close-up on nightstand
**Description:** Close-up of Valentina's finger pressing the small brass switch on the base of the white ceramic nightstand lamp. The warm amber light extinguishes. The room plunges into near-total darkness — only the faintest blue-white glow from the city outside seeps through the sheer curtains, casting the softest suggestion of shapes on the walls. The phone screen is dark, face down. The novel, the earbuds case, and the water glass (refilled from the kitchen) are barely visible silhouettes on the nightstand. The oscillating fan hums its constant low note. Valentina's hand withdraws from the lamp and slides back under the duvet.

### Scene 172: Falling Asleep
**Time:** 10:30 PM — deep darkness, faint city glow through curtains
**Setting:** Valentina's bedroom, wide shot from foot of bed
**Description:** Valentina lies in bed, eyes closed, face peaceful in the near-darkness. The white duvet rises and falls gently with her slow, deep breathing. Her long dark hair is spread across the white pillow. One hand rests beside her face on the pillow, the other beneath the duvet. The room is dark and quiet — the oscillating fan provides steady white noise. Through the sheer curtains, the faintest warm glow of Cali's city lights creates a soft amber-blue halo at the window. The framed watercolor above the headboard is a dark rectangle. The apartment is still. Tomorrow's running clothes wait silently on the dresser. The alarm is set. Another full day as Dr. Valentina Restrepo is complete.
